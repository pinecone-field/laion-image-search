North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance are among those who were sent the vetting materials, another source familiar with the process said. Earlier Wednesday, Rubio said he hadn\u2019t talked to the Trump campaign about being vice president but added, \u201cI am sure once they make a decision, they will let everyone know.\u201d People familiar with the deliberations caution that Trump\u2019s search for a running mate is still in flux. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson have also been sent various levels of paperwork in the vetting process, according to two sources familiar with the process. Sources insist that the vetting process would look different for each person. \u201cA number of prospective candidates have exchanged documents or have had conversations with the team,\u201d one senior Trump adviser told CNN, adding, \u201cThe level of conversations and the level of documents have varied widely.\u201d The campaign emphasized that only Trump would make the final decision. \u201cAnyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\u201d another senior Trump adviser, Brian Hughes, said. NBC News was first to report that the vetting materials had been sent out. Trump has floated a lengthy list of names in recent months and routinely asks allies, donors and members of his Mar-a-Lago resort for their opinion. He routinely praises many of these contenders publicly at his campaign rallies and in interviews. Many of the potential picks have spent recent weeks publicly demonstrating their loyalty to Trump, including appearing with him at court for his New York criminal hush money trial and defending him on television. Trump was ultimately found guilty of\u00a034 counts of falsifying business records. In an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday, Trump mentioned Scott, Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Carson when asked about his search for a potential running mate. \u201cWe have some unbelievable people,\u201d the former president said as he rattled off the names. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to hold it.\u201d Trump said in an interview with TMJ4 News last month there was a \u201cpretty good chance\u201d he would announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is slated to take place from July 15 to 18.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_trump-campaign-trail-conviction", "text": "During his decades in the public eye, Donald Trump has stood before crowds as a builder of skyscrapers and casinos, a best-selling author, a reality television host, a husband and father, a New Yorker and Floridian, and a current and former president of the United States. On Thursday, he addressed an audience for the first time with his newest moniker: Felon. Trump spoke at a town hall in Phoenix, marking his first campaign appearance since a Manhattan jury last week convicted the presumptive Republican nominee on 34 counts related to a scheme to pay off a porn star ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 in a trial that he falsely referred to as \u201crigged\u201d on Thursday. Trump will next head to California for a fundraising swing before a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, his first since the verdict. The flurry of events signals a new phase of the campaign for Trump with his New York case now largely behind him. No longer tethered to a Manhattan courtroom during the week, Trump is expected to ramp up his activity as he pivots from the trial to the trail. But as he steps back onto the campaign trail as a convicted felon, the urgency for Trump has crystalized. Now staring down a sentence in the hush money case, his best ticket to avoid more serious charges in the three other indictments he faces is convincing Americans to put him in office again. Trump\u2019s allies have responded to the unprecedented moment with escalating calls for retribution \u2013 both in the immediate aftermath of his conviction and if he recaptures the White House. Trump himself has also threatened his political opponents, continuing the retaliatory rhetoric that has permeated from his campaign since the onset. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible precedent for our country,\u201d Trump said during an interview with Newsmax that aired Tuesday. \u201cDoes that mean the next president does it to them? That\u2019s really the question.\u201d Trump had already galvanized his supporters around his legal troubles long before last week\u2019s verdict. His rallies had become a space for Trump to riff on his multiple indictments, test the boundaries of gag orders, attack the justice system and cast himself as a victim in a conspiratorial plot to keep him from the White House. His campaign believes that messaging has braced the Republican base for this outcome \u2013 and it isn\u2019t expected to stop. His supporters have responded with an unprecedented wave of donations that flooded the Trump campaign\u2019s coffers with $53 million online in the 24 hours after his conviction, his advisers said, and the fundraising appeals centered on his convictions have continued. In text messages Saturday to supporters, Trump\u2019s campaign sent a link to donate and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m still standing. 34 rigged felony convictions can\u2019t keep me down.\u201d Still, Trump can\u2019t soon move out from under the lasting cloud of his felonies nor the uncertainty it has cast over his third White House bid. Chief among the unknowns is how the broader electorate will respond to the first criminal conviction of a former US president. The event in Arizona \u2014 from which 11 people were transported to hospitals after reports of heat exhaustion, according to the Phoenix Fire Department \u2014 was hosted by the conservative group Turning Point Action. Trump\u2019s arrival put him in a state where undecided voters could determine his fate and comes days after President Joe Biden\u2019s latest action to secure the border \u2013 an issue the former president has used to hammer the Democrat with each passing surge of migrant crossings. Biden on Tuesday announced an executive action giving him authority to effectively shut down the US-Mexico border to asylum seekers entering illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded. Biden and his allies have framed his new policy as moving in the face of Republican inaction, noting that Trump helped kill a bipartisan Senate deal to unleash new resources toward securing the border. \u201cThe American people demand solutions to fix our broken immigration system, but at every step of the way, Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans have made clear they only want chaos and partisan politics as usual,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement Tuesday. Trump used the opportunity in Arizona to deliver an extended response to Biden\u2019s asylum action, vowing to rescind it on his first day in office if he wins in November. \u201cJoe Biden wants an invasion. I want a deportation,\u201d Trump said, baselessly calling Biden\u2019s policy \u201cpro-invasion\u201d and \u201cpro-child trafficking.\u201d Much of his prepared remarks focused on immigration, although the event was clearly intended to rally Trump\u2019s base around his recent conviction as well. \u201cPresident Trump has proven time and again that he is an absolute force of nature that the left fears more than any other,\u201d Turning Point Action founder and Trump ally Charlie Kirk said in a statement announcing the town hall. \u201cThey know Joe Biden can\u2019t beat him in a fair fight, so they\u2019ve disgracefully weaponized the justice system.\u201d The Trump campaign, though, was not concerned Trump will muddy the message on immigration by focusing on his legal battles. Trump \u201ccan walk and chew gum,\u201d a source with knowledge of his remarks told CNN prior to the rally. \ufeffThis story has been updated with Trump\u2019s remarks.

When asked by interviewer David Muir of ABC if he would rule out pardoning Hunter Biden, the president said, \u201cYes.\u201d He also affirmed he would accept the outcome of the trial, currently underway in Delaware. The courtroom proceedings have delved into a painful moment for the Biden family, as Hunter was struggling with drug addiction in the aftermath of his brother Beau\u2019s death. First lady Dr. Jill Biden attended the trial before traveling to France to join her husband for D-Day commemoration activities. The White House had said previously that Biden would not pardon his son. \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear; the president is not going to pardon his son,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in December. The president\u2019s son is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he\u2019s been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. The charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss. It\u2019s\u00a0the first time in US history that\u00a0the child of a sitting president\u00a0has been on trial. Biden has previously voiced support for his son and said he was proud of his recovery from addiction. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d the president said in a statement Monday as the trial was getting underway. \u201cHunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\u201d he went on. \u201cAs the President, I don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d The trial is underway the week after a New York jury returned 34 guilty counts against former President Donald Trump for falsifying business records in an attempt to cover up hush money payments to a porn actress. Trump has decried the verdict and falsely accused Biden of orchestrating the criminal charges. In the interview Thursday, Biden accused Trump of trying to subvert the rule of law by questioning the verdict in his own criminal trial. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to undermine it,\u201d Biden told Muir. \u201cHe got a fair trial.

Jake Hoffman on Thursday pleaded not guilty to multiple felony charges related to the Republican lawmaker\u2019s alleged role in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results. His attorney, Timothy La Sota, entered the plea on his client\u2019s\u00a0behalf. Hoffman appeared before Court Commissioner Shellie Smith via Zoom\u00a0\u2013 with a painting of Ronald Reagan on a wall behind him \u2013\u00a0after an Arizona\u00a0grand jury handed up an indictment against him and 17 other defendants in April. He was charged alongside 10 other individuals who served as fake electors from the state and multiple close allies of former President Donald Trump. Hoffman, who was\u00a0elected\u00a0as a member of the Republican National Committee for Arizona just days after being indicted in April, told the judge he has plans to travel out of state this summer to attend various pre-planned Republican events. The judge released Hoffman on his own recognizance and will \u201callow travel for purposes\u00a0of his employment.\u201d His next court date is a pre-trial hearing set for July 2. Hoffman\u00a0sent a two-page letter\u00a0to Vice President Mike\u00a0Pence on January 5, 2021, asking him to order that Arizona\u2019s electors not be decided by the popular vote of its citizens, but instead by members of the state Legislature. \u201cIt is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,\u201d\u00a0Hoffman\u00a0wrote at the time.

Trump\u2019s New York concealed carry license was quietly suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges in New York, the official said. Two of the three pistols he was licensed to carry were turned over to the NYPD on March 31, 2023, and\u00a0a third gun listed on Trump\u2019s license \u201cwas lawfully moved to Florida,\u201d the person added. After Trump was convicted of 34 felonies on May 30, 2024,\u00a0he could be in violation of multiple state and federal laws\u00a0if he still possesses that third gun in Florida. CNN has reached out to representatives of Trump to determine whether he still has a gun in Florida. Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is a federal crime. The\u00a0NYPD\u2019s Legal Bureau will complete its investigation \u201cthat will likely lead to revocation of his license,\u201d the senior police official said.

Trump has had a license from the\u00a0NYPD\u00a0to carry a concealed firearm for more than a decade, according to multiple law enforcement sources, but because Trump\u2019s application came with a request for confidentiality, they are exempt from public records requests, according to the\u00a0NYPD\u2019s guidelines and New York state law. The suspension and pending revocation of his carry license suggests that he maintained his license the entire time of his presidency and after, until he was charged with multiple felonies for falsifying business records in March 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_us-and-allies-warn-china-recruit-pilots", "text": "The US and its closest intelligence partners are warning that China has intensified a campaign to recruit former Western military pilots and other service members to train its own aviators, according to a joint bulletin released by the nations on Wednesday. Beijing has for years struggled with its air operations \u2014\u00a0including both pilot proficiency and its technical capabilities to counter western aviation tactics \u2014\u00a0even as it has built up its air and naval forces in preparation for a possible military takeover of the island of Taiwan. Western-trained pilots can teach Chinese military personnel everything from air combat tactics to how to land on an aircraft carrier, according to a US official. They can also give China a precious window into how it can counter western combat tactics. The warning was issued by the so-called Five Eyes nations, which share higher-level intelligence among them: the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cTo overcome their shortcomings, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army has been aggressively recruiting Western military talent to train their aviators,\u201d said Michael Casey, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, part of the US intelligence community. \u201cRecent actions by Western governments have impacted these operations, but PLA recruitment efforts continue to evolve in response.\u201d Asked about the bulletin on Wednesday, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon \u201calways expect that our pilots will uphold the standards that they are trained under, and that they keep their training specific to the United States.\u201d \u201cI think there are national security risks there,\u201d she said. The bulletin, released by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, warns that Beijing has used private companies that often hide their ties to the Chinese military to attract western pilots, contacting them via headhunters or professional networking sites and offering \u201clucrative contracts and the opportunity to fly exotic aircraft.\u201d Military pilots, flight engineers, and air operations center personnel, as well as \u201ctechnical experts with insight into Western military tactics,\u201d it said, have been \u201cthe most sought-after targets.\u201d These private companies have set up notionally independent operations in third countries like South Africa, Singapore and Laos, according to the US official. Former western pilots \u2014\u00a0which number at least in the dozens \u2014\u00a0are training Chinese military officials who then return to China and, in turn, train more pilots there, this person said. The US has sought to crack down on the tactic, in part by sanctioning some of the third-party companies.\u00a0But China has adapted, according to intelligence officials. \u201cThere have been efforts to incorporate entities in different locations under different names,\u201d said an NCSC official. \u201cThere have also been variations in recruitment pitches and approaches.\u201d Years of concern The bulletin caps years of growing concern by the US and its allies that the PLA was seeking to gain insight into western military tactics and technology by recruiting its former pilots. It also comes as tensions have continued to grow between China and Taiwan, just weeks after China launched large-scale military drills surrounding the island in what it said was punishment for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d after Taiwan elected a new president. Adm. John Aquilino, the former head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told Congress in March that combined, the PLA Navy and PLA Air Force \u201cconstitute the largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d In September, Gen. Charles Q. Brown \u2014 then the Air Force chief of staff and now the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \u2014\u00a0warned in a letter\u00a0to the Air Force that foreign companies were \u201ctargeting and recruiting US and NATO-training military talent\u201d to assist the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cBy essentially training the trainer, many of those who accept contracts with these foreign companies are eroding our national security, putting the very safety of their fellow servicemembers and the country at risk, and may be violating the law,\u201d Brown said. \u201cJust as I am asking for your help, I have also asked for help from our allied Air Chiefs to address the same issue within their ranks. In January of this year, US and NATO officials held a conference focused on countering Chinese recruitment of allied personnel to enhance their own air operations. The issue burst into the public consciousness in October of 2022, when former US Marine fighter jet pilot Daniel Duggan was arrested in Australia for allegedly training PLA pilots how to land on aircraft carriers. He has been held in a maximum-security prison in Australia since 2022, CNN has previously reported, after he worked in Beijing for six years. An indictment in 2017 alleged that Duggan trained Chinese pilots while he was still a US citizen, between November 2009 and November 2012. Duggan, now a naturalized Australian citizen, has denied the allegations that he broke US arms control laws. That same month, the UK Ministry of Defense issued a security alert after several of its military pilots were also found to have been training the PLA Air Force. The pilots had been contracted through a private South African company that offered high salaries. Canada and Australia announced investigations into the practice that same year. The US is seeking Duggan\u2019s extradition and is awaiting a final decision from the Australian Attorney General. The Arms Export Control Act, which bans weapons sales, also prohibits the training of foreign military personnel without explicit authorization. The bulletin on Wednesday also comes after multiple US service members have been arrested for allegedly leaking classified intelligence to China. In March, a US Army sergeant was charged with allegedly leaking classified information about advanced US weapons in exchange for $42,000. Last August, two US Navy sailors were arrested for allegedly sending sensitive military information to Chinese intelligence officers. Matt Olson, the Justice Department\u2019s assistant attorney general for national security, said in a press conference at the time that the charges against the two sailors \u201cdemonstrate the (People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s) determination to obtain information that is critical to our national defense by any means, so it can be used to their advantage.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/us-and-allies-warn-china-recruit-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_maga-inc-trump-election", "text": "One of Donald Trump\u2019s leading super PACs told donors it raised nearly $70 million in May and shared plans to spend $100 million this summer in key battleground states, according to a copy of a memo sent Tuesday and obtained by CNN. Taylor Budowich, the CEO of Make America Great Again, Inc., laid out the PAC\u2019s strategy to boost Trump in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 all states that the former president narrowly lost in 2020 and that remain competitive four years later. The document, sent to CNN by a source who received it, serves as a marker for how top Trump allies see his pathway to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to secure victory in November. The super PAC\u2019s haul \u2013 which cannot be independently confirmed until it files federal finance reports covering May \u2013 is in addition to the combined $141 million the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee said they raised last month, a massive influx of cash that coincided with the former president\u2019s New York hush money trial and conviction on 34 felony counts. The memo, which was first reported by The New York Times, argues that the Trump campaign and his allies remain well positioned in the ad wars despite President Joe Biden\u2019s and Democrats\u2019 longstanding financial advantage. Though it has spent far less in many top battlegrounds, MAGA Inc. said it has not had to burn through cash to keep Trump\u2019s voter coalition together \u2013 unlike Democrats, who have poured millions into ensuring Black and female voters remain engaged this cycle. \u201cTheir current buy is a sign of tremendous weakness and desperation,\u201d Burdowich wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like if MAGA Inc. launched a massive ad campaign targeting Christian radio \u2026 in rural Georgia.\u201d The memo details how much of the $100 million that the super PAC plans to spend through Labor Day will be aimed at further siphoning Democratic votes away from Black and Hispanic communities, core demographics with whom Trump is faring better this cycle than in previous elections. It also describes how\u00a0MAGA Inc. intends to compete for voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 states viewed as critical to Trump\u2019s path to winning back White House. In Pennsylvania, where the super PAC has been on air for months hammering Biden\u2019s record and capacity to lead, it intends to remain active through November. The Keystone State has swung left in the years since 2016, when Trump became the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state in almost three decades. Biden won it in 2020 and two years later, Democrats won races for governor and Senate over Trump-endorsed candidates by healthy margins. If signs start pointing toward Trump flipping Pennsylvania, it would intensify the fight over Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 which are also part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states \u2013 giving the president\u2019s party a very narrow path to holding the White House. \u201cWinning Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral points is the ball game,\u201d Burdowich said. In Georgia,\u00a0MAGA Inc. intends to place a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d media buy through Labor Day. Budowich described the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes as presenting \u201cthe best gateway to the White House for President Trump \u2013 delivering the targeted 270 electoral votes.\u201d If the Peach State \u2013 which Biden surprisingly flipped in 2020 \u2013 remains competitive into the fall, that would suggest deeper trouble for Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/maga-inc-trump-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_bob-menendez-trial-gurbir-grewal", "text": "New Jersey\u2019s top prosecutor and a high-ranking deputy had just finished a 2019 meeting with US Sen. Bob Menendez in the Democrat\u2019s Newark office. After a quiet elevator ride down to their car, Andrew Bruck turned to his boss, state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and broke the silence. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Bruck said, \u201cthat was gross.\u201d The unnerving exchange with Menendez, Grewal testified in federal court Thursday, was his second such conversation with the senator, who is being tried on charges that he engaged in a bribery scheme and acted as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government. Like in a previous exchange, months earlier, Menendez told Grewal he was concerned over the treatment of Hispanic defendants \u2013 a worry, the senator said on both occasions, tied to a specific, ongoing case being handled by the attorney general\u2019s office of insurance. Grewal, who left office in 2021, told the court that the initial call had caught him off-guard. He had no personal relationship with the senator, who called him on his private line after obtaining the number through Grewal\u2019s cousin. After some small talk, Grewal said, Menendez pivoted to the matter he would bring up again in his office \u2013 with no one present but him and the two visitors \u2013 on September 6, 2019. On both occasions, Grewal testified, he told Menendez that the defense lawyer in the case, Michael Critchley, should be the one to raise any issues \u2013 and that if he did, they should be directed not to him but to the prosecution team or judge. Menendez, in Grewal\u2019s opinion, seemed surprised that Bruck had come along for the in-person meeting. Once inside, seated at a small circular conference table at the front of Menendez\u2019s sprawling, high-windowed office, the senator again pressed Grewal on the treatment of Hispanic defendants. Grewal said Menendez then, once again, brought up the case of Elvis Parra, who had been indicted on insurance fraud charges. Parra was an associate of businessman Jose Uribe, who was indicted as part of the bribery scheme before striking a plea deal with federal prosecutors earlier this year. Grewal testified that Menendez never explicitly identified the case or defendants by name in either interaction, only telling Grewal it involved Hispanic truckers prosecuted by the insurance fraud division in the attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the case. I didn\u2019t want to know the case,\u201d Grewal said, telling the court he still does not know the details of the case Menendez was discussing. The meeting ended shortly thereafter, lasting about 15 minutes. Menendez had retreated to small talk, Grewal said, after the attorney general again refused to engage on the specifics. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an explicit ask,\u201d Grewal told the court, but he had become concerned that Menendez was trying to meddle with the case. He did not tell any of his rank-and-file attorneys about their exchanges. \u201cInsulating the team from any type of pressure or interference from the outside\u201d was an important part of his job, Grewal said, telling the court he believed spreading word of Menendez\u2019s interest risked creating \u201ca chilling effect\u201d around the case. Menendez\u2019s lawyers disputed that notion, repeatedly asking Grewal if their client had in any way threatened or sought to intimidate him. His answer, over and over again, was no. The pressure, Grewal said, was baked into their conversations from the start. Menendez \u201cwas a close political ally of the governor\u2019s, so that was my concern, sort of being on his bad side,\u201d Grewal testified. Grewal is the government\u2019s 14th witness in a trial that is already in its fourth week,\u00a0as prosecutors try to prove Menendez, two co-defendants and the senator\u2019s wife, Nadine, engaged in a global bribery scheme that delivered the Menendezes gold bars, blocks of cash and a new Mercedes in exchange for the senator using his post and power to influence public officials to benefit his associates. \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Lara Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, told the jury in her opening remarks. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket.\u201d The senator\u2019s team has insisted that he committed no crimes and, to the extent that there had been any unsavory business dealings, Nadine Menendez was the driving force. Nadine\u2019s trial was separated and pushed back to this summer. The senator disclosed last month that she has breast cancer. In testimony a day earlier, an FBI agent combed through a massive trove of communications among the alleged conspirators, including text message exchanges focused on the Parra case. In January 2019, Nadine, who was Menendez\u2019s girlfriend at the time, asked Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman and one of the co-defendants, to tell her \u201cwhat the charges are.\u201d (Lawyers for Hana and developer Fred Daibes, the third alleged co-conspirator, declined to cross-examine Grewal.) \u201cThe matter only involves four counts,\u201d Hana replied, and is \u201ca relatively small indictment.\u201d A few minutes later, Nadine called the senator.

Trump, who\u00a0faces the possibility of a prison sentence\u00a0after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked\u00a0in an interview aired Sunday\u00a0on Fox News about how he had \u201cfamously said\u2026\u00a0\u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president. During his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton \u201cwould have been a terrible thing.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up,\u2019 but the people would all say \u2018lock her up, lock her up.\u2019\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d is false. He called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by\u00a0using the phrase \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself. \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0after the crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina. \u201c\u2018Lock her up\u2019 is right,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania. Trump also explicitly called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment using different phrasing. \u201cHillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a June 2016 speech in California. \u201cShe has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0repeated\u00a0in an October 2016 speech in Florida.\u00a0And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Trump\u00a0softened his rhetoric\u00a0shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and didn\u2019t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to \u201clock her up.\u201d \u201cYou should lock her up, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted \u201clock them up\u201d in relation to the Biden family, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cYou should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_biden-d-day-american-leadership", "text": "The new world for which the greatest generation sacrificed in the bloody surf of the Normandy beaches is fading into history along with the last of the old soldiers. The 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings observed by President Joe Biden in France Thursday will likely be the last major decennial commemoration attended by significant numbers of veterans. Even a 19-year-old who stormed ashore in the biggest amphibious operation in history would soon be 100. \ufeff\u201cWe\u2019re not far off from the time when the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us, so we have a special obligation,\u201d Biden said after embracing and saluting the last surviving members of the invasion force, above the beaches where thousands of Americans died. \u201cWe cannot let what happened here be lost in the silence of the years to come.\u201d This year\u2019s memorial ceremony represents far more than a poignant farewell to surviving comrades of more than 150,000 allied troops who forged a beachhead for the liberation of Europe from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazis. Presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from NATO nations gathered at a paradoxical moment. They are unusually united but experiencing growing dread. The alliance has a new sense of mission in opposing another war started by a tyrant bent on territorial expansion \u2014 this time in Ukraine. But at no point since June 6, 1944, has the unshakable US leadership of the West and support for internationalist values been so in question. Democracy is facing its sternest test in generations from far-right populism on the march on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Geopolitical empires like Russia and China are, meanwhile, resurgent and threatening to obliterate the global system dominated by Western values that has prevailed since World War II. Biden drew a direct line between the evil that US soldiers were called up to fight in the 1940s and the current attempt by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia to wipe Ukraine off the map and extinguish its democracy. \u201cWe cannot let that happen.\u00a0To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable. Were we to do that, it means we\u2019d be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches. Make no mistake: We will not bow down, we will not forget,\u201d he said. Those who served in Normandy, Biden said, \u201call understood our democracy is only as strong as we make it all together. They knew, beyond any doubt, there are things that are worth fighting and dying for. Freedom is worth it, democracy is worth it, America\u2019s worth it, the world is worth it \u2013 then, now and always.\u201d His words were especially resonant amid growing fears in Europe that the United States \u2013 the bulwark of democracy ever since World War II \u2013 may be about to turn its back on the West. US allies already rattled by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s constant attacks on NATO in his first term were further rocked by his recent comment that he\u2019d let Russia do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d with allies that he regarded as failing to \u201cpay their bills\u201d on defense spending. The comment weakened the foundational NATO creed of mutual self-defense without which the alliance has no meaning. Some of Trump\u2019s ex-advisers have warned that he might try to exit the alliance if he wins a second term in November. Even if Biden wins, there are growing indications that Americans\u2019 willingness to maintain the security guarantees \u2014 even to former enemies like Germany and Japan that bought 80 years of peace \u2014 may be waning. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy has taken deep root in the Republican Party that once prided itself on winning the Cold War. The ex-president tried to overturn US democracy to stay in power four years ago. And some GOP figures led by the ex-president now appear to have more empathy for Putin than liberal European democracies that the United States rebuilt after World War II. And the monthslong delay in funding Biden\u2019s most recent aid package for Ukraine raised doubts that Washington will always stand up for democracy in Europe and against aggression by autocrats. Biden on Thursday cited an unrepayable debt owed to US, British, Canadian and other troops involved in Operation Overlord. He walked among row upon row of white crosses and Stars of David shaded by pine trees and oaks overlooking Omaha Beach. This is where more than 9,000 fallen Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia lay at rest thousands of miles from the land they left to save foreigners they\u2019d never met. When the final survivors of World War II are soon gone, the world will lose living testimony of a fight against tyranny that once involved millions of people and unimaginable pain and destruction. That will usher in a dangerous period when malevolent political actors will find it easier to distort history to bolster their own power. This has already been happening as the lessons of the Nazi Holocaust, from which there are dwindling numbers of survivors to bear witness, have been challenged by a rise in antisemitism in Western societies. Is America really \u2018back\u2019? Biden took great pleasure in traveling the world after winning the 2020 election and declaring \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d He lived up to his words by wielding the most effective leadership of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush at the end of the Cold War. But many foreign leaders worry that Biden\u2019s term is an interregnum of normality rather than a return to the certainty of US leadership. With his volatile temperament, transactional suspicion of alliances and idolizing of dictators, Trump\u2019s first term turned the United States from a bulwark of stability into an unpredictable force of disruption. After a long period of denial, many in the chancelleries of Europe expect Trump to be back. Trump\u2019s mix of isolationism and populism did not emerge in a vacuum. It was distilled from years of US military failures abroad in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and a growing belief among many Americans that the globalized world was eroding the domestic dividend of prosperity and security that flowed from World War II and was built by those who returned from the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific. A growing sense that Americans are tiring of their global role has sparked overdue debates in some European capitals about doing more to ensure the continent\u2019s own security. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believes that the internal threat to the West is as great as the external one posed by US enemies. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also what\u2019s happening to the political center in France, the political center in Germany, the likely gains of the far right in the upcoming EU elections. Even if Biden were to win, Americans, Europeans are asking difficult questions about American reliability.\u201d Success was not assured The Normandy landings, long regarded as a triumph, marked the moment in history when the United States truly emerged as a superpower with the might and the will to make the world safe for democracy. But at the time, the risk of sending an armada across the English Channel in questionable weather to battle hardened Nazi forces was enormous. As allied forces landed on the beaches, President Franklin Roosevelt uttered a D-Day prayer over the radio. \u201cAlmighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.\u201d To begin with, fears of failure seemed justified. By the end of June 6, none of the invading forces had achieved their first-day objectives. More than 10,000 were dead, wounded or missing. The Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, had prepared a message before the invasion in case of a retreat. \u201cIf any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone,\u201d he wrote. But the future president never had to take his remarks out of his wallet. In the days ahead, the allies slowly established a foothold in the northwest tip of the continent. After breaking out, they were in Paris by August and, after often bitter fighting, victory in Europe was won by May 1945. For many years after World War II, D-Day commemorations lacked the fanfare and high diplomatic and political significance they carry today. And there\u2019s an argument that the geopolitical symbolism has become too heavy and threatens to obscure the simple courage of dwindling groups of veterans who make a pilgrimage to honor slain comrades. But French and American presidents especially have used the gatherings as a stage to renew transatlantic bonds. In an especially significant piece of statecraft this time, the Western leaders will be joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has billed his nation\u2019s fight for survival after the Russian invasion as an echo of the allied battle against Hitler. Russian leaders or top officials have also attended the commemorations, at least since the end of the Cold War, in honor of the Soviet Union\u2019s staggering losses fighting the Nazis. But Putin is now a pariah and has not been invited. This year\u2019s event has important domestic connotations for several leaders. It will be the first of the decennial commemorations to feature Britain\u2019s King Charles III as head of state after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, a fixture in Normandy for decades. And it offers a stage for French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden, both politically weakened, to highlight their statesmanship at a moment of global turmoil. Biden will on Friday echo one of his predecessors, Ronald Reagan, who in 1984 traveled to a clifftop 100 feet high known as Pointe du Hoc, which was scaled in a daring raid by US Army Rangers on D-Day. Despite heavy losses, the Rangers seized German artillery pieces that could have caused even greater carnage of the Omaha and Utah invasion beaches. Reagan stood in front of a stone memorial shaped into the Rangers\u2019 emblem, with his back to the Channel, surrounded by surviving veterans of the raid, and gave one of the greatest presidential speeches. \u201cThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,\u201d Reagan said. He later confessed to his diary that he was so moved it was tough to get the words out. The speech came at a particularly contentious moment in the Cold War with tensions high between Washington and the Soviet Union. But Reagan\u2019s clarion call for freedom may have had an impact. Less than a year later, Mikhail Gorbachev became secretary general of the Soviet Communist Party and set in motion reforms and nuclear arms negotiations that led to the end of the Cold War. Biden, like the 40th president, is facing concerns about his age in his reelection year. And on Friday he will visit the same clifftop to make a similar call to save democracy. Reagan\u2019s Pointe du Hoc speech is not just remarkable for its poetry. Forty years on, it\u2019s stunningly relevant to a new political era. And it\u2019s equally striking how far the Republican Party has traveled from the man who once personified it to the anti-democratic American Firstism of its current hero. \u201cWe in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs. We\u2019re bound by reality. The strength of America\u2019s allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe\u2019s democracies. We were with you then; we are with you now. Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny.\u201d In 1984, Reagan could offer that promise without fear of contradiction. Biden cannot do the same in 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-d-day-american-leadership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters", "text": "The way American campaigns are financed can be impenetrable even to people who pay close attention to politics. Campaigns can only get so much money directly from donors. More money flows to organizations that can\u2019t technically coordinate with campaigns but sure seem to come close. Separate organizations can also try to influence elections by pushing for issues, but they sure seem to try to benefit candidates. Add into that complicated mess the fact that former President Donald Trump has been paying his copious legal bills through the campaign finance system. To better understand what we know about how and by whom campaigns are being funded in 2024, I went to Fredreka Schouten, who covers this complicated issue for CNN. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below. WOLF: What are the broad strokes of what we know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: During the course of this campaign, the former president has asked his political donors to help pay his soaring legal bills. The primary vehicle has been a leadership PAC called Save America that Trump established after he lost the White House in November 2020. Trump seeded the PAC largely with money he raised in the aftermath of his loss when he asked for donors\u2019 help in fighting what he claimed was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. (Save America also transferred some of that money \u2013 $60 million \u2013 to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., that could directly spend money to help his campaign. More on that later.) As a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, Trump has consistently diverted a share of new political donations to Save America, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 to his legal expenses. For instance, a joint fundraising agreement among Trump, the Republican National Committee and a couple dozen state GOP committees\u00a0sends donations to Save America\u00a0before the national party and state committees get their cut, underscoring how much Trump prioritizes paying lawyers. Since the start of 2021, Save America has paid\u00a0nearly $80 million in legal bills\u00a0for Trump and others in his orbit. In April 2024 alone, as Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York got under way, the PAC racked up about $4.4 million in legal expenses between bills paid and outstanding debts, recent filings how. A big recipient: The law firm of Todd Blanche, the lead attorney representing Trump as he battled criminal charges in a Manhattan courtroom that centered on whether he falsified business records to conceal an election-eve payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump was convicted on May 30 and has vowed to appeal. WOLF: Can he simply use campaign dollars for court bills? Does the law allow that? SCHOUTEN: Federal campaign finance law is riddled with all sorts of loopholes. Technically, candidates cannot use money donated to their campaigns for personal expenses \u2013 whether that\u2019s to pay a criminal defense lawyer in a personal matter or to buy groceries. But the agency that enforces federal election law treats leadership PACs such as Save America differently than candidates\u2019 main campaign accounts. Leadership PACs started off as committees created by current and former members of Congress to help boost their profiles and support other candidates. They cannot be used to directly support a presidential campaign. But over the years, they really have become slush funds \u2013 helping underwrite travel, polling, meals and other expenses politicians incur. Keep in mind that Trump\u2019s allies maintain that applying donors\u2019 money to legal expenses is a legitimate use because they characterize all his legal troubles \u2013 whether in civil or criminal cases \u2013 as part of an extensive \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d organized by his enemies to derail his campaign. WOLF: How has the drain of his legal problems affected Trump\u2019s campaign war chest? SCHOUTEN: Well, the bills grew so high that Save America has clawed back tens of millions of dollars from the super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. So, as a practical matter, a super PAC focused on helping Trump get elected ended up diverting money to help pay legal bills during the early months of the presidential campaign. But one thing has become clear: Trump\u2019s team has used his legal difficulties as an engine to generate donations. We\u2019ve seen fundraising spikes during big court appearances but none so big as the nearly $53 million that Trump\u2019s political operation said it brought in in the 24 hours after the New York conviction last month. That single-day haul accounts for more than one-third of the whopping $141 million that the Trump campaign said it raised with the Republican National Committee in May. And MAGA Inc. just announced a May fundraising bonanza, saying it brought in nearly $70 million last month. WOLF: What are the important details we don\u2019t know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: We really don\u2019t have the full picture of legal expenses from campaign finance reports. Senior advisers have told CNN that Trump is paying some of his legal expenses out of pocket, for instance.\u00a0And we don\u2019t know how much the Trump Organization, his real estate and branding company, might be underwriting. During the New York criminal trial, for example, Rhona Graff, the president\u2019s former longtime assistant at the Trump Organization, testified that the company was paying her legal bills. WOLF: A complaint has been filed against Trump for hiding payments to lawyers. What\u2019s that about, and what could come of it? SCHOUTEN: The Campaign Legal Center\u00a0watchdog group filed the complaint with federal election regulators against Trump\u2019s campaign and related committees, alleging they have concealed details on millions of dollars in legal payments by routing the money through a vendor. The complaint centers on more than $7 million paid by Trump-aligned committees to Red Curve Solutions, LLC as \u201creimbursements\u201d for legal expenses \u2013 although the company is not a law firm and largely provides services to help campaigns comply with federal election reporting requirements. Bradley Crate, the treasurer of Trump\u2019s campaign, oversees Red Curve. In its complaint with the Federal Election Commission, the Campaign Legal Center said the payments suggest that Red Curve \u201croutinely advanced money or paid for the cost of legal services provided by other vendors\u201d and was later reimbursed, which would violate disclosure requirements of federal campaign finance law. Neither Crate nor the Trump campaign have responded to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the complaint. Don\u2019t expect action from the FEC anytime soon. The commission \u2013 evenly divided along partisan lines \u2013 often deadlocks on enforcement decisions or takes action years after a complaint is first lodged. WOLF: What is Joe Biden\u2019s team doing differently to test the campaign finance rules this year? SCHOUTEN: I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s doing anything differently, but he\u2019s relying on tactics we\u2019ve seen most politicians use in the big-money era \u2013 even if they have decried the rise of so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that keep their donors\u2019 identities private. The main super PAC supporting Biden\u2019s bid, Future Forward, gets a big chunk of its funding from a nonprofit arm that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors to the public. Our CNN Investigates colleague Casey Tolan earlier this year pored over tax records to report about a couple with ties to artificial intelligence investments and cryptocurrency trading emerging as some of the biggest donors to Future Forward\u2019s dark-money arm. WOLF: Is most of the election spending coming this year from campaigns, super PACs or issue organizations? SCHOUTEN: So far this year, outside groups \u2013 including super PACs and issue organizations \u2013 are leading the spending in advertising in the presidential race, according to a tally of AdImpact data by our CNN colleague David Wright, who keeps close tabs on political ads. That\u2019s not surprising. Candidates face strict limits on the size and source of donations they receive, but super PACs and other outside groups can raise unlimited sums from a wide array of sources. If you include future reservations, the pro-Biden super PAC currently leads presidential spending with some $130 million in ads reserved for the fall. But there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t be overtaken by Republican groups as the general election campaign heats up.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_trump-abortion-medication-policy-supreme-court", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is continuing to duck on questions about abortion access that Americans will face if he is elected \u2014 the latest involving the US Supreme Court\u2019s case that could limit access to medication abortion. Trump vowed on April 27 to release more details on how a future Trump administration would regulate the abortion pill mifepristone, telling Time Magazine\u00a0he has \u201cpretty strong views\u201d on the issue and would be making an announcement \u201cprobably over the next week.\u201d That announcement never came. And now his presidential campaign says they have no expectations for it come anytime soon, even as a decision in the case could come as early as Thursday, the court\u2019s next opinion day. The evasion underscores the tightrope Trump continues to walk when it comes to abortion \u2014 an issue that has become a controversial flashpoint ahead of the 2024 election. Since launching his third bid for the White House, Trump has\u00a0struggled to reckon with the political fallout from the overturning of Roe v. Wade, a sea change in the country\u2019s abortion policy brought on by his makeover of the Supreme Court during his first term. \u201cLooking at policy on that, it\u2019s still an internal process, but I don\u2019t expect anything prior to the court weighing in on it at this point,\u201d one of Trump\u2019s advisers said. \u201cThat type of announcement, I\u2019d be surprised if that were to come in front of the court.\u201d A second Trump adviser echoed that sentiment: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna wait and see how everything shakes out with the courts.\u201d The adviser added that there are \u201ca lot of other issues that are just as important. We\u2019ve got to focus on the economy, got to focus on immigration. There\u2019s a lot of things that are happening.\u201d Trump\u2019s policy team has been informally drafting policy on the issue behind the scenes for weeks and have sought counsel from outside allies, such as his former aide Kellyanne Conway, according to sources familiar with the process. However, two senior Trump advisers told CNN they currently have no\u00a0immediate\u00a0plans to release a proposal regarding mifepristone and instead intend to wait for the Supreme Court\u2019s highly-anticipated decision regarding the US Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine. The case deals with whether the FDA overstepped its authority by expanding access to mifepristone, such as by allowing the drug to be dispensed without in-person clinical visits. Access to mifepristone\u00a0has become more important in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and many Red states have banned the procedure. The appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who say their practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups insist that it is safe. Republicans, who for decades have made abortion restrictions a centerpiece of their policy agenda, have varying views on how abortion medication should be regulated. While some conservatives and anti-abortion groups have pushed for it to be banned, others have called for a more measured approach, such as requiring that it only be administered by a physician. Part of what anti-abortion advocates are grappling with are the optics of a Trump administration taking regulatory action that would crack down on medication abortion vs. relying on courts to take similar action. \u201cThe sticky wicket is if the Democrats can say you used the court to deny women access to a legal and FDA approved medication. It\u2019s a problem. Frankly, I don\u2019t know how you stop it. It is clear that the FDA exceeded their authority,\u201d one anti-abortion leader, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told CNN. \u201cYou could rein in the FDA and say it requires a physician consultation or something similar. Abortifacients shouldn\u2019t be treated like aspirin.\u201d A second senior Trump adviser told CNN that the team acknowledges the vast and differing opinions held by conservatives on how to approach the issue and has been \u201ccognizant of not just the political angles, but a lot of the technical goals that we need to be aware of and think through before we can come to some sort of decision.\u201d And while the former president often touts that he was the most pro-life president the country ever had, he also continues to view the issue as political loser for Republicans ahead of November, sources close to Trump say. For much of the 2024 Republican primary, Trump avoided the topic of abortion, and when he did weigh in, he sometimes angered anti-abortion leaders by criticizing the rush of new restrictions from members of his party in response to the landmark decision. In April, he announced that he believes abortion policy should be left to the states, further frustrating many of those leaders. The Biden campaign has sought to capitalize on the issue, warning in campaign events and ads of what a second Trump administration could mean for abortion rights. \u201cThe question is \u2014 if Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next? Your body and your decisions belong to you, not the government, not Donald Trump. I will fight like hell to get your freedom back,\u201d\u00a0President Joe Biden said in one ad released after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing a Civil War-era ban to be enforced. (The Republican-controlled state legislature has since repealed the ban.) Recent polling conducted by CNN\u00a0shows roughly half of US adults, 49%, want to see federal politicians work to enshrine abortion access nationally, while 37% say abortion laws should be left to states,\u00a0and 14% call for nationwide restrictions. A number of\u00a0Trump\u2019s advisers and allies described the former president as constantly weighing the political ramifications of every major announcement on such a sensitive issue, while also wanting to preserve policy flexibility for a second term. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t dumb. He recognizes that banning abortion drugs isn\u2019t good politics right now,\u201d a person close to Trump told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a sticky situation to navigate, but he\u2019s keeping his options open.\u201d However, the sources also acknowledged that Trump\u2019s penchant for punting on the issue could further frustrate some of his key allies in the conservative movement who helped propel him to the White House in 2016, many of whom are still irked by his refusal to back a nationwide abortion ban \u2014 despite heavy pressure from anti-abortion groups and allies to do so. Trump\u2019s evasion at odds with conservatives pushing for more restrictions The decision to hold off on outlining a clear plan for how to handle abortion medication comes as many of these groups are calling for Republicans to take a more aggressive approach in restricting abortion medications, and view the FDA vs. AHM case before the Supreme Court as a key opportunity to push for more regulation. \u201cAlthough the case is related to abortion, the question before the Court is whether the FDA broke the law and its own rules when it removed virtually every safety standard, ignoring women\u2019s need for in-person doctor visits and ongoing care when taking dangerous abortion drugs,\u201d Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, has said of the case.\u00a0\u201cDoctors, who have been witnessing the harm to women and girls, are asking the Court to hold the FDA accountable for failing its duty to protect public health and safety.\u201d Mainstream medical groups have rebuked the claims that mifepristone is unsafe, and much of the Supreme Court oral arguments earlier this year focused on whether the anti-abortion doctors challenging the FDA\u2019s rules had shown that they were actually being harmed by the drug\u2019s current regulatory regime. With the current uncertainty around the Supreme Court case,\u00a0one question\u00a0that\u00a0has been widely discussed within the conservative movement\u00a0is\u00a0the possibility\u00a0that the\u00a0next GOP administration\u00a0would\u00a0enforce a 19th century\u00a0federal law that would ban the mailing of drugs used for abortions. The Comstock Act, as the law is known, banned not just the mailing of drugs that induce abortions, but also contraceptives, pornography and other \u201clewd\u201d materials. It has been dormant for decades, undermined by court rulings in the early 1900s that limited its reach. But the criminal statute has gotten more attention in the post-Roe v. Wade landscape, particularly after it came up in the Supreme Court\u2019s oral arguments in this term\u2019s blockbuster abortion pill case. Trump was asked specifically by Time Magazine whether his future Department of Justice would enforce the Comstock Act, noting that his allies have called for it. \u201cI will be making a statement on that over the next 14 days,\u201d the former president\u00a0said, adding that he has \u201ca big statement on that. I feel very strongly about it. I actually think it\u2019s a very important issue.\u201d There is debate among conservatives about not just whether a future Republican administration should enforce the Comstock Act, but what that enforcement would look like. The Heritage Foundation, for instance, cites a wide-ranging interpretation of the law and its enforcement as a key priority for the next GOP administration in their policy plan, titled Project 2025.\u00a0The document, however, is vague on the mechanics of enforcing. Some anti-abortion advocates view the Comstock Act as a potential workaround for a Republican administration to restrict abortion access without needing to rely on Congress \u2014 and have called for it to be interpreted broadly as prohibiting the shipment of abortion drugs from manufacturers, which could have the effect of banning medication abortion nationwide. But others in the anti-abortion movement have pushed back on the idea that it would be used so aggressively. In recent months, however, some influential anti-abortion lawyers have declined to even say what they believe to be the scope of the criminal statute.\u00a0CNN asked a series of leading anti-abortion groups and conservative lawyers to weigh in on their views of the law. All declined to answer on the record. Drexel Law Professor David S. Cohen put it this way: \u201cThis is a make or break election for the future of abortion in this country, not because of the national ban, but because of the Comstock Act. And you know,\u00a0I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right interpretation of the Comstock Act, but it doesn\u2019t matter what I think. All that matters is if you have a Department of Justice, who thinks that is the right interpretation, and five justices of the Supreme Court who agree.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed, Andrew Seger, Phil Mattingly, John Fritze and Betsy Klein contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/trump-abortion-medication-policy-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_border-biden-trump-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is pulling from former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration playbook as he tries to stop a flow of asylum-seekers from around the world who are crossing into the US at the border with Mexico. Unveiled at the White House on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s new plan to all but shut down the US border to asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally uses executive authority Trump once used to bar people from mostly-Muslim countries from entering the US in 2017 and also to bar most asylum-seekers in 2018 \u2013 days after Republicans suffered huge setbacks in midterm elections that year. It\u2019s an odd, election-year twist, since Biden actually ran his 2020 campaign in part on a promise to revoke those actions, which he did in the months after taking office. Trump\u2019s asylum policy was also blocked by federal courts before Biden revoked it. In addition to slowing the flow of asylum-seekers, Biden\u2019s action could have the political effect of chipping away at Trump\u2019s lead on the immigration issue and triangulating some middle-ground support, even if it leaves progressives angry. Read the full story on Biden\u2019s announcement from CNN\u2019s White House team. Trump and Biden remain very far apart It\u2019s still very true that their rhetoric on immigrants remains very different. Biden expresses openness to immigrants as an important segment of American society. He wants to protect the children of undocumented immigrants who have grown up in the US and to create a pathway to citizenship for those already here. Trump routinely employs over-the-top rhetoric to demonize migrants and asylum-seekers as being from a criminal class or part of a coordinated invasion of the US, although there\u2019s no evidence to support those claims. Trump has promised a militaristic approach to the border and a massive deportation program if he\u2019s elected in November. Biden, meanwhile, has been pivoting to the middle on immigration all year. The decision to invoke executive authority comes months after a bipartisan border proposal in Congress failed to yield a new permanent law to reform the asylum process. Republican lawmakers, bowing to Trump, refused to work with the White House. Trump had said he wanted to run on the issue of immigration in this election year. Announcing the new action at the White House, Biden said he was trying \u201cto do what the Republicans in Congress refused to do.\u201d Even if he\u2019s adopting the authority behind Trump\u2019s policy, he promised not to adopt Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country,\u201d Biden said at the White House. Biden argued that exceptions in his action make it more humane than Trump\u2019s proposals. Asylum-seekers can still try to make an appointment with border officials and seek asylum at a port of entry. Expect challenges The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged Trump\u2019s border actions when he was president, now plans to challenge Biden. \u201cIt was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,\u201d Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement. But today\u2019s Supreme Court, which has a majority of conservative appointees, could be more friendly to Biden\u2019s action. Border crossings are actually down CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores reported from Hidalgo, Texas, on Tuesday and noted the decline in crossings. Whereas last December, there were around 250,000 border apprehensions, figures in recent months are less than 140,000, and Flores reported the figures dropped even further in May. The Biden plan would bar migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met, with some exemptions. The measure would stay in place until encounters drop below an average of 1,500 per day. Officials in Hidalgo County told Flores that any measures to address the influx of asylum-seekers would need to take into account the cross-border traffic that generates economic activity in the area. A top official in Hidalgo County, Judge Richard Cortez, told Flores that Biden\u2019s action, while welcome, was a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d and not a permanent solution. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform remains the sole solution and Congress remains the sole venue to achieve this reform,\u201d Cortez said in a statement to Flores. Flores described her interviews with women who became victims of sexual violence while waiting on the Mexico side of the border for asylum claims to be processed and pointed to the vulnerable position today\u2019s action could force migrants into if they wait on the Mexico side of the border. Why now? CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, reporting from the White House, said part of the administration\u2019s calculus had been to wait until after Mexico\u2019s presidential election, which took place over the weekend, to announce this new action. Americans\u2019 ability to cut border crossings will rest, she said, in part on Mexico\u2019s ability to stop the flow of asylum-seekers within its borders. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our Mexican neighbors instead of attacking Mexico,\u201d Biden said at the White House, drawing a distinction between his approach and Trump\u2019s. Biden said he spoke with Mexico\u2019s president-elect on Monday. Trump holds an advantage on immigration CNN\u2019s Harry Enten notes that in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration has taken on increasing importance in the minds of voters. Troubling for Biden is that Trump is favored by 27 percentage points on the issue, according to polling from CNBC. Watch more from Enten: Long-standing authority Presidents have been using the authority to act on the border for decades; it is based in a 1950s immigration law. Here\u2019s the specific language: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The authority has routinely been used, according to the Congressional Research Service, by all recent presidents to restrict entry to the US for specific groups of people, like Europeans at one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, suspected terrorists or officials from countries like Iran. A fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security outlines the specific changes in how noncitizens will be processed at the border. People apprehended and slated for expedited removal would need to express fear of returning to their home country in order to be interviewed about their situation. Otherwise, they will quickly be returned to either Mexico or their home country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/border-biden-trump-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_rfk-jr-election-president", "text": "Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is perhaps the biggest X factor remaining in the presidential race. If the current polling matches the final result, Kennedy \u2013 a onetime Democrat who tends to be better liked by Republicans \u2013 would earn the second-highest vote share of any independent or third-party White House candidate in the past half-century. But can Kennedy defy the usual gravity of politics that drags down most non-major party hopefuls as the election approaches? There are already some signs that his support may have already peaked. Now, Kennedy, at this point, is still pulling a substantial portion of the vote. He scored 14% and 17% in May polls conducted by Quinnipiac University and Marquette University Law School respectively. That\u2019s better than any third-party or independent candidate has polled in an individual survey at this stage in the cycle since Ross Perot in 1996. It\u2019s that high level of support that has caused both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to go after Kennedy. Trump is likely reading the polls that show Kennedy is slightly more likely to pull from voters who say they would be more inclined to vote for the former president. Biden is likely aware that Kennedy voters tend to skew younger \u2013 a demographic that traditionally leans Democratic. The attacks leveled on Kennedy seem like they may be having an effect. Take a look at polls conducted by Fox News, Quinnipiac and Reuters/Ipsos. All have trend lines dating back to late last year. In these three polls, Kennedy\u2019s support has dipped by an average of 5 points from their first survey to their most recent. Fox News has him going from 15% to 11%; Quinnipiac has him going from 17% to 14% (in a ballot test that includes Green Party candidate Jill Stein); Reuters/Ipsos shows him dropping from 17% to 10% among registered voters. This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t find a poll that has Kennedy doing slightly better than he was a few months ago (see Marquette). But the long-term trend line for Kennedy is not positive. Perhaps more concerning for the independent candidate is what\u2019s going on under the hood. His declining support isn\u2019t just a matter of voters now believing that backing anyone who isn\u2019t a Democrat or Republican would be a wasted vote. This is a matter of Kennedy himself becoming less liked. Take two polls that asked about Kennedy after he declared his independent candidacy in 2023 and then last month. His unfavorable rating in May\u2019s Quinnipiac poll jumped to 43% among voters, his highest on record. Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating dropped to 25%, just one point above his all-time low in the Quinnipiac poll. His net favorability was minus-18 points. He\u2019d previously never had a net negative favorable rating in the double digits. Kennedy, for almost the entire campaign, had considerably higher net favorability than either Biden or Trump. This was reversed in the latest Quinnipiac poll. Marquette\u2019s polling showed a somewhat similar trend. In November, Kennedy had a 38% favorable and 38% unfavorable rating. Today, he\u2019s at a 31% favorable and 45% unfavorable rating \u2013 his worst to date. (Marquette found Kennedy with a net favorable rating of +8 points during the primary season in February, when his unfavorable rating dipped to 32%.) Both Marquette and Quinnipiac continue to show that Kennedy is better liked by Republicans than Democrats. But even there, Kennedy has seen a clear decline in popularity. From April to May, Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating went from 44% among Republican voters to 31% in Quinnipiac\u2019s polling. His unfavorable rating climbed from 20% to 30%. The dip in Kennedy\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t the biggest surprise. The last time Trump faced off against an unpopular Democrat (Hillary Clinton in 2016), Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson looked like he could become the first independent or third-party candidate since Perot to take at least 5% of the presidential popular vote. Johnson ended up fading down the stretch, getting a little bit more than 3%. That was still the highest percentage for a non-major presidential candidate since Perot in 1996. This year, Kennedy is consistently polling higher than Johnson was in 2016. But Johnson had access to the Libertarian ballot line and was on the ballot in all 50 states. Kennedy, however, is currently nowhere near securing official ballot access in all 50 states. So all these national polls that indicate high levels of support for Kennedy aren\u2019t telling the full story if he won\u2019t be an option on many voters\u2019 ballots. Of course, this election isn\u2019t going to be won through the national popular vote. It will be won state-by-state through the Electoral College. How many ballots Kennedy gets on in the six closest states that Biden won in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) will ultimately be what determines his role in this election. Getting on the ballot isn\u2019t always easy for an independent, as Kennedy has learned in his ballot battle with Nevada. Still, this election is expected to be a close one, especially in the northern battleground states. Any share of the vote that Kennedy takes away from Biden or Trump could end up being crucial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/rfk-jr-election-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Biden\u2019s decision to loosen restrictions around the use of US weapons in Ukraine came after Russia made significant advances around the city in the northeastern part of the country close to the Russian border. While it marked a break from long-standing policy, it is limited to the area around Kharkiv,\u00a0and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, a US official previously told CNN, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Wednesday, Putin warned Western countries they\u2019re taking a \u201cvery serious and dangerous step\u201d by supplying weapons to Ukraine, which could result in Moscow arming their enemies. \u201cSupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,\u201d Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. \u201cEspecially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.\u201d Biden, however, insisted Thursday, \u201cThey\u2019re authorized to be used in proximity to the border. We\u2019re not authorizing strikes 200 miles into Russia, we\u2019re not authorizing strikes on Moscow, on the Kremlin.\u201d The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-putin-russia-ukraine-us-weapons/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_takeaways-day-4-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "The prosecution\u2019s most important witness against Hunter Biden, his sister-in-law-turned-girlfriend Hallie Biden, testified Thursday that she believed he was using drugs when she saw him in October 2018, the month he claimed on a federal background check that he was clean. Jurors\u00a0sat forward in their seats while she was on the witness stand. Some who have rarely taken notes jotted on their notepads as she provided critical testimony that filled in some lingering gaps about the time when Biden bought the gun. Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son, is charged with three felonies, stemming from prosecutors\u2019 claim that he was using or addicted to drugs when he bought and owned a revolver in October 2018. He pleaded not guilty. He has spoken openly about his yearslong addiction to crack cocaine, and a key witness already testified that she watched him smoking the drug in September and November 2018. Before court wrapped, special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team announced that they planned to rest their case on Friday, after they present testimony from two experts from the FBI and DEA. That puts the case on track to potentially head to the jury early next week, Hunter Biden\u2019s lead attorney said. Here\u2019s what to know from the trial\u2019s fourth day in Wilmington, Delaware: Star witness Hallie Biden In many ways, Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who then dated his brother Hunter, was teed up to be the special counsel\u2019s star witness. She\u2019s the only person expected to testify who saw Biden in October 2018, when he returned to Delaware and bought the .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver. She testified that she believed \u2013 based on her observations and his behavior \u2013 that Biden was using crack cocaine around October 22 and 23, days after he purchased the pistol. However, under cross-examination, she acknowledged she didn\u2019t personally see Biden using drugs in the month of October, a point the defense team has zeroed in on \u2013 trying to carve out October and create reasonable doubt. She also said she didn\u2019t see a lot of Biden in October. Jurors saw messages between the two where she was trying to get ahold of him, and wondering if he was seeing other women. In one message from that time period, she asked, \u201cAre you in New York with Zoe?\u201d referring to Zoe Kestan, who was romantically involved with Biden around the same time and testified about his rampant drug abuse. Biden\u2019s lead attorney Abbe Lowell challenged Hallie Biden repeatedly during his extensive cross-examination. Hallie Biden \u2018panicked\u2019 and threw out the gun Hallie Biden described how events spiraled out of control after she found Biden\u2019s gun on October 23, \u201cpanicked\u201d and drove to a grocery store to throw the pistol in a trashcan. \u201cI panicked and I wanted to get rid of them \u2026 because I didn\u2019t want him to hurt himself or I didn\u2019t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves, and I just panicked and wanted to get rid of it,\u201d she testified. She then drove to Janssen\u2019s Market, a grocery store just a couple minutes away, and threw it in a trash can. Hunter Biden quickly discovered that his gun was missing and things went south, according to text messages shown to the jury. He was very angry, she testified. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe anyone is that stupid,\u201d he texted her amid the crisis, according to the messages presented by prosecutors. She later replied, \u201cYou can blame me all you want. I know it was stupid, but your part is dangerous and negligent. And because of this and my stupidity for being worried about you, I\u2019m dealing with insanity and possibly I\u2019m the one going to get in trouble.\u201d During cross-examination, Hallie Biden repeatedly said she didn\u2019t recall details from the day, including around phone calls between her and Hunter Biden or the timing of when she found the gun in his truck and where all she went that day. \u201cThere are some things you remember and many things you don\u2019t,\u201d Lowell told her, pointedly. Hallie Biden\u2019s drug use Early in her testimony, Hallie Biden testified to using drugs, saying that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack cocaine in 2018. \u201cIt was a terrible experience that I went through, and I\u2019m embarrassed and I\u2019m ashamed, and I regret that period of my life,\u201d she said. She said she quit in August 2018. She later said she went to rehab in Pennsylvania in early October 2018. Biden attended some \u201ccounseling\u201d with her as part of the treatment, she said. Lowell suggested this was the reason why Hunter Biden returned from Los Angeles to Delaware \u2013 which is where he bought the gun weeks later. Finding the gun Delaware State Police Lt. Millard Greer later testified about the series of events that led to the recovery of Biden\u2019s gun, after Hallie Biden reported it missing. Through security footage and interviews, investigators learned that an elderly man who liked to rummage around trash bins for recyclables may have taken the gun out of the trashcan that Hallie Biden had dropped it in. Greer said he surveilled the man at a Fidelity Investments storefront in the area, before approaching him later. The man, Thomas Banner, acknowledged that he found something very important in the trash. They went back to his home to retrieve the gun, but Banner was locked out of his house and started \u201cpanicking,\u201d Greer said. They eventually got inside, and Banner led Greer to the gun, which\u00a0Greer said\u00a0was\u00a0stuffed\u00a0in a sock\u00a0inside\u00a0a General Motors lunchbox.\u00a0He also, to Greer\u2019s surprise, handed over a second gun that he said he\u00a0had been\u00a0holding on to for years, and was given\u00a0to him\u00a0by a coworker who needed to get rid of\u00a0it to protect his brother. The 80-year-old Banner later took the stand, and both Lowell and prosecutor Derek Hines stood inches away from him during questioning, speaking in slow, clear words because he was hard of hearing. He described how even while at GM, where he worked for more than 30 years, he would collect aluminum cans and recyclables from trash bins. Banner said he\u2019d drive them up to New York to exchange for money, noting\u00a0he used to get a nickel per can but now could only gets upward of 75 cents for a pound. The retiree also identified a brown pouch he found with the gun. Prosecutors say FBI investigators found a white powder that tested positive for cocaine on the pouch, years after it was found. Hines asked the 80-year-old if anyone in his house used cocaine. \u201cNo,\u201d Banner said.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_republicans-justice-system-what-matters", "text": "Last week, President Joe Biden was defending the justice system as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of society. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Republicans tried to undercut the process that led to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York on state charges. This week, the president will have to remember those words while his son Hunter faces federal gun charges at a trial in Delaware, the first of two separate cases this year that could lead to jail time. The Biden family must be frustrated that a plea deal fell apart last year when it was rejected by the Trump-appointed judge in the case, Maryellen Noreika. Plus, these particular gun charges are rarely prosecuted on their own, perhaps evidence of the enhanced scrutiny placed on a president\u2019s son. Very different trials Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial is very different than Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, even if they both come in an election year, feature the public airing of painful, personal details and essentially boil down to allegations of lying on paperwork. Trump had to endure the detailed, public testimony of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleged an affair with Trump nearly 20 years ago. Hunter Biden will have to endure a public recounting of his affair with his brother Beau\u2019s widow, their tortured text messages and his drug addiction. But Trump\u2019s legal problems all revolve around his own campaigns and actions during and after his presidency. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments meant to cover up the alleged affair from voters in 2016. He also faces federal charges of mishandling classified information in Florida and trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, DC, as well as Georgia. Hunter Biden faces trial in Delaware starting this week for lying on a firearm background check application. He checked the box that said \u201cno\u201d he was not abusing or addicted to drugs. He also faces trial in California later this year for tax evasion. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed special counsel prosecuting the case, has never made allegations to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s tax problems to his father, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried, unsuccessfully, to connect the dots. I\u2019ve written before about how the Department of Justice ends up prosecuting similar numbers of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In New York this week, for instance, the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 his second distinct corruption trial in recent years \u2013 is underway. Trump may ultimately avoid federal prosecution. There is a very real possibility that Trump, while found guilty in a New York courtroom, will face neither set of the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith before Election Day in November. The US Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, and the judge in his classified documents case has delayed proceedings indefinitely. The Georgia case is also delayed, and an appeals court may not consider whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case until October. A chorus of bias allegations But while Joe Biden\u2019s son and the senior senator from New Jersey are both in major legal peril, it is quickly becoming an article of faith among Republicans that they are a targeted species by the justice system. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system,\u201d Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The justice system \u201chunts Republicans while\u00a0protecting Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, reacting to the Trump guilty verdict. In a fundraising pitch on X, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida encouraged supporters angry about the \u201ctravesty\u201d to \u201cget even.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took the conspiracy theorizing much further, arguing that the Department of Justice is only prosecuting Menendez and, separately, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas (who is also charged with bribery) because they have been critical of Biden on foreign relations and immigration policy \u2013 an allegation for which there is no evidence. Cotton predicted Biden would ultimately pardon his son. The White House has said there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden. Even Republicans who opposed Trump during the 2024 primary season are critical of Trump\u2019s New York conviction. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu complained that Trump will face sentencing days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThat is a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to do nothing but rile everybody up. It\u2019s going to look even more political than it is now, and just cast a shadow of a doubt on this entire case.\u201d \u2018I may feel differently about it\u2019 The irony here is that Trump in 2020 actually did pressure the Department of Justice to investigate Hunter Biden. He also pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to open an investigation, hoping to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company to his father. In 2016, Trump\u2019s supporters would launch into \u201clock her up\u201d chants targeting Hillary Clinton \u2013 behavior Trump encouraged at the time even though the FBI, in the form of then-director James Comey, announced before the election that there was not a strong enough case to prosecute Clinton over her private email server. Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that if elected again, he might feel differently about pushing for charges against Clinton. \u201cThey all said \u2018lock her up.\u2019 But I felt \u2013 and I could have done it \u2013 but I thought it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me. So I may feel differently about it,\u201d Trump said. Democrats promise to let the process play out against Hunter Biden Don\u2019t expect Democrats to show the same level of support for Hunter Biden that Republicans have shown for Trump. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised Democrats would respect the process as it plays out against the president\u2019s son. \u201cDemocrats are not out there saying that Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is a farce, it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s rigged. We\u2019re not attacking the justice system,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/republicans-justice-system-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_biden-age-wall-street-journal-report-analysis", "text": "It\u2019s the recurring threat President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid will never be able to fully outrun. The White House was forced into a fresh damage control effort Wednesday to defend the 81-year-old commander in chief\u2019s acuity as he embarked on a grueling foreign trip and as the race gets nastier by the day. The latest episode was sparked by a Wall Street Journal article that cited descriptions \u2013 disputed by the White House \u2013 of the president\u2019s state of mind and fitness from what it described as more than 45 interviews with both Democrats and Republicans. The president was depicted as speaking so softly in one meeting about Ukraine that he was almost unintelligible to some participants. Other sources questioned whether he was fully in command of key details of his own policies. Democrats accused Republicans quoted or referred to in the account of making false claims and contradicting previous statements to damage Biden politically. Washington Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, complained on X that her comments to the Journal about the president\u2019s strong engagement in a meeting on Ukraine in January were not used by the paper. Biden has managed to tamp down previous kerfuffles over his age and capabilities this year with a robust public performance at his State of the Union address in March. He so surpassed Republican expectations that some in the party absurdly flipped from portraying him as doddering and incompetent to suggesting he must be drugged up. But all it takes is one halting on-camera moment or media report to revive the frenzy over Biden\u2019s age. This was inevitable as soon as the president decided to run for a second term that would begin when he is 82 and would end when he\u2019s 86. Biden\u2019s team habitually dismisses any concern over his capacity, and his doctors have certified him fit for duty. Democrats often claim this is an issue hyped up by the media, while pointing out that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump isn\u2019t young either \u2013 he turns 78 next week. This particular Wall Street Journal article may be a Beltway drama that isn\u2019t occupying the minds of most voters. But they are concerned about Biden\u2019s age. And the question of the president\u2019s fitness for office is a legitimate one even if Republican efforts to portray him as weak and incoherent have obvious political motivations. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll in February, for instance, 86% of Americans thought Biden was too old to serve another term. That included 59% of Americans who thought both he and Trump were too old and 27% who thought only Biden was too old. Voters can also see it for themselves. The president has clearly slowed in office. He does often speak quietly and mangle his words more than he did even as a gaffe-prone senator and vice president. The job of commander in chief is one of the most exacting in the world, involves constant life-and-death decisions and comes with no genuine days off. Public speculation about the capacity of the president is also a highly sensitive issue \u2014 and is often indulged in by pundits with no medical expertise. Millions of Americans have some familiarity with the indignities of aging. That may offer Biden some sympathy, but it\u2019s also a reason why many have concerns about an octogenarian serving as commander in chief. Biden defiant about his capabilities Biden \u2014 who was one of the youngest senators in US history and is now its oldest sitting president \u2014 bristles when asked whether he\u2019s too old to be president, or would be late in his second term when he\u2019d reach his mid 80s. \u201cI can do it better than anybody you know.\u00a0You\u2019re looking at me, I can take you too,\u201d Biden quipped to a reporter in a recent Time Magazine interview. \u201cWatch me. Look, name me a president that\u2019s gotten as much done as I\u2019ve gotten done in my first three and a half years.\u201d Massimo Calabresi, Time\u2019s Washington bureau chief, said that during their meeting, Biden came across \u201cvery much as he appears on TV,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is older than when he started in office. It\u2019s visible if you just look side by side on the tape.\u201d In his story, Calabresi wrote: \u201cThe President, with his stiff gait, muffled voice, and fitful syntax, cut a striking contrast with the intense, loquacious figure who served as Senator and Vice President.\u201d The debate over Biden\u2019s age is rendered more complex since he\u2019s running against a 77-year-old. Trump might come across as more energetic than his successor, whom he\u2019s dubbed \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d but the former president himself often appeared to be snoozing during his criminal trial in New York. The campaign trail version of Trump raises other concerns \u2014 not least because of his volcanic demeanor and estrangement from the truth. But Trump, like Biden, has recently bungled names, misidentified people and offered nonsensical public comments. Asked about the Wall Street Journal report by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump on Wednesday said, \u201cWe have a chance of going into World War III because of our leader. So I don\u2019t want to get into what state he\u2019s in,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not something for me to talk about.\u201d The former president went on to say Biden was not \u201cmentally sharp enough\u201d to do the job, before adding, \u201cand I don\u2019t believe he was 20 years ago, either.\u201d Fitness for office is often in the eye of the beholder. The Republicans who insist Biden is too diminished see no reason why a twice-impeached convicted felon who has echoed Nazi rhetoric and is promising to use presidential powers in a personal quest for \u201cretribution\u201d against his enemies should not return to the Oval Office. Biden is increasingly focusing on Trump\u2019s mental capacity. He has told audiences in fundraising events recently that \u201csomething snapped\u201d after Trump lost the 2020 election and that he\u2019s \u201cclearly unhinged.\u201d Has Biden slowed or is he \u2018savvy and effective\u2019? The Journal article, headlined \u201cBehind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,\u201d detailed anecdotes about the president\u2019s attentiveness in meetings. It said that Democrats and Republicans reported that he has slowed and that some of his engagement and energy fluctuated and that he had good days and bad days. The Journal noted, however, that most of those who were critical of Biden\u2019s performance were Republicans. The paper quoted former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not the same person.\u201d Current House Speaker Mike Johnson worried the president\u2019s memory \u201chad slipped about the details of his own policy,\u201d the Journal wrote, citing six people who had been told about the speaker\u2019s views. (The White House denied Biden had misspoken during that exchange.) Neither speaker is a disinterested observer. Both have vested political interests in playing into Trump\u2019s claims that Biden is too old or absent to serve. The White House responded to the Journal story by saying in a statement that \u201cCongressional Republicans, foreign leaders and nonpartisan national-security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment.\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates added: \u201cNow, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.\u201d There is no current public evidence that Biden is unable to carry out the most onerous duties of his job that include making vital decisions to ensure the country\u2019s national security, especially in emergencies and at times of crisis. Still, the public facing part of the presidency is also important. A fair-minded person cannot help but note that Biden is not the same dynamic room-filling force that he was for years. The break that Biden and his aides enjoyed from questions about his age after his barnstorming State of the Union address followed a previous age-related frenzy. Special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s February report into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents described him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and a transcript of the encounter showed Biden occasionally flustered and searching for dates. But the totality of the encounter doesn\u2019t support Republican claims of advanced cognitive decline. The report, however, was followed by a disastrous press appearance that served more to highlight questions of age than dampen them. \u201cI know what the Hell I am doing,\u201d the president said. But at one point, he compounded his problem when he meant to talk about the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said \u201cthe president of Mexico.\u201d On other occasions in February, Biden twice referred to dead European leaders \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl \u2013 when referring to conversations with their modern-day counterparts. Biden\u2019s stamina will be tested in the long haul to November\u2019s election. In the coming weeks, he has the kind of schedule that would exhaust anyone. He\u2019s due to return from France on Sunday, and is expected to fly to California for fundraising, before crossing the Atlantic again for the G7 summit in Italy next weekend. Even for someone with their own plane, it\u2019s a heavy lift at 81. Then he faces the most critical phase in his reelection campaign so far: his June 27 debate with Trump on CNN, which represents the most high-profile test of a sitting president\u2019s capabilities on live television since a much younger Ronald Reagan confronted similar questions in his 1984 reelection race. Presidents have great power. But even they cannot turn back the ravages of time. So it will not be long before Biden is once again called on to insist that he\u2019s not too old to serve. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to try to depict Democrats as the \u201ctrue radicals\u201d on abortion policy. To make his case, though, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made wildly inaccurate claims. In a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump said, \u201cHard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born. Killing a person after birth is illegal in every state. \u201cEvery state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no basis for this claim,\u201d Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: \u201cThe falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.\u201d There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified \u201cother places.\u201d But he was wrong then, too: New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though false social media posts claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator\u2019s 2022 bill that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was revised before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee acknowledged that the early text\u2019s vague use of the phrase \u201cperinatal death\u201d might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom clarified that the \u201cperinatal death\u201d immunity is specifically for \u201cperinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.\u201d In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the false claim that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: \u201cI say, let the states decide. This is \u2014 every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN.  \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d Maya Manian, an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned,\u00a0said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_tim-scott-black-latino-voters-outreach", "text": "South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a contender to be former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, is launching a multimillion dollar effort to recruit Black voters to support Republicans in 2024. The effort will target swing and low propensity Black and Latino voters. Scott will tour battleground states and host smaller events in the coming weeks as he makes direct appeals to voters of color, with the hope that they will shift their support to the GOP. The plan, which is being backed by Scott\u2019s Great Opportunity PAC, is to spend more than $14 million, including $5 million on earned and paid media. It will focus primarily on Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where thin margins may determine the outcome of the presidential election. A source familiar with the plans said that the goal is to get started as soon as possible. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign are aware of the initiative, and the source said that they plan to be a resource where needed and vice versa. But, the source said, this wasn\u2019t a directive from the Trump campaign. Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, argued Black voters and other minorities are turning to the GOP because of the contrast between the Trump years and the Biden administration, which he deems a failure on the economy, the border and crime. \u201cA lot of reasons why the shift is becoming just so blatantly obvious that it\u2019s now undeniable that there is something amiss,\u201d Scott said at a briefing this week with reporters in Washington, DC. \u201cIt\u2019s not just racial, but it\u2019s going to manifest itself in a racial shift that we haven\u2019t seen in probably three decades of politics.\u201d \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t had before was a recent president on the right vs. the current president on the left. And that translates into a lot of ticked off people who are looking at the Republican Party,\u201d he said. Scott says working class Americans and African American men in particular are wide open for a political shift. He\u2019ll tout what he characterizes as wins under the Trump administration, like forgiving debt for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Central to his argument is that many Black voters are faith oriented and culturally conservative and they are not voting in alignment with their social values by continuing to support Democrats. Scott believes this message will resonate in places like Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Detroit \u2013 all major cities in key battleground states. The senator also stressed the importance of showing up in places where Republicans aren\u2019t typically welcome. Trump recently had a campaign event in the Bronx, a county that voted overwhelmingly for Biden over Trump in 2020, according to CNN\u2019s election results. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about this for years that we have to go where we\u2019re not invited,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe have just not had enough candidates doing that from the party, and now we do, and we\u2019re gonna see the results that are consistent with that.\u201d This effort from Scott comes at a time when the Biden campaign sees cracks in their support from Black voters. A New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states released in May found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in CNN\u2019s exit poll. In the same survey, 14% of Black voters said that if the election were held today, they would vote for Trump vs. 49% for Biden. Hispanic voters were 31% for Biden and 31% for Trump. When it comes to non-White voters without a college degree, 32% said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today while 27% said they would back Trump. While 69% said there is \u201cnot really any chance\u201d they would vote for Trump, 24% of Black voters in the poll said there is \u201cnot really any chance\u201d they would cast their vote for Biden. Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika cast Scott\u2019s outreach as a \u201clast-ditch effort\u201d to defend Trump\u2019s \u201cracist agenda.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden is on the campaign trail showing up \u2013 himself \u2013 to earn, and not ask for, Black Americans\u2019 support. That is what leadership looks like,\u201d Chitika said in a statement. Just last week, the Biden campaign went to Philadelphia launching a nationwide effort to mobilize Black voters, characterizing the Trump campaign as one with a \u201cracist and toxic agenda.\u201d An April New York Times/Siena poll suggested that Biden\u2019s support continues to lag behind typical Democratic performance among several key subgroups within the party\u2019s usual coalition, with Black voters breaking 69% for Biden to 16% for Trump and Hispanic voters dividing 50% for Biden to 41% for Trump. Younger voters were split about evenly, 46% for Biden to 45% for Trump. Scott is making the case that there are voters up for grabs, and in a tight election, it could make the difference if they turn out for Trump, rather than coming home to Biden or not voting at all. Scott also said that he thinks that Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony charges is helping drive \u201cmore folks to the Republican Party period.\u201d He suggested that the conviction, which he told Fox News is unifying the Republican Party, has the potential to pull more Black men into the fold. \u201cI think African American men, specifically, have experienced a lot with the justice system, not all of the good, and therefore, watching an injustice play out that is just so blatant, a lot of African American men have said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m gonna take a closer look at the Republican Party,\u2019\u201d Scott said. Trump recently suggested something similar in February at a gathering of Black conservatives in South Carolina ahead of the state\u2019s Republican primary. \u201cA lot of people said that that\u2019s why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I\u2019m being discriminated against,\u201d Trump said. Separate from Trump, the Great Opportunity PAC sees this opportunity to close the gap with voters who feel like Democrats let them down. As CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak reported last week, Biden\u2019s aides say they aren\u2019t taking Black voters for granted as surveys suggest an erosion of support, particularly among Black men. \u201cThey feel like their vote has been taken for granted,\u201d Jennifer DeCasper, executive director of the Great Opportunity PAC said, referring to Black and brown Democrats.\u00a0\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to jump on the Republican bandwagon anytime soon. But I do feel like now we are on a level playing field where we can also compete for their votes and compete for their ears, and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s happened in a really long time.\u201d \u201cWe are in a position where we want to step into that space, step in pretty heavy handed and show that we have not only the right policy, but we actually care about winning their vote and keeping their vote,\u201d DeCasper said.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_steve-bannon-jail", "text": "A federal judge on Thursday ordered Steve Bannon to report to prison by July 1, giving the former Donald Trump adviser a short window to get a higher court\u2019s intervention. Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 after failing to provide\u00a0documents and testimony\u00a0to the House Select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. He was sentenced to four months in prison. The federal judge presiding over the case, Carl Nichols, had initially paused the sentence while Bannon appealed the conviction. Last month, however, a DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, and prosecutors immediately asked Nichols to send Bannon to prison to begin serving his sentence. Nichols said Thursday that, given the appeals court ruling, he did not believe the basis he had for pausing Bannon\u2019s sentence \u201cexists any longer.\u201d The judge, who was appointed by Trump, said that he concluded that he had the authority to lift the hold on Bannon\u2019s sentence, even as an appeal of conviction will continue. Potential high court intervention Shortly after the hearing concluded, Bannon vowed to fight his contempt of Congress conviction \u201call the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\u201d Bannon also claimed without evidence that his prosecution by the Justice Department was about \u201cshutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There\u2019s not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,\u201d he told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win at the Supreme Court,\u201d he added. Second ex-Trump adviser punished over subpoena non-compliance At the hearing, Bannon\u2019s attorney, David Schoen, argued that his client should be able to remain out of prison until the Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the case. Schoen also said that his request for the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case would be filed by June 24. Prosecutor John Crabb said that Bannon had not satisfied the legal threshold for staying out of prison while his appeal continued. Crabb pointed to the failed effort by Peter Navarro, another ex-Trump adviser prosecuted for refusing to comply with a House January 6 committee subpoena, to pause his sentenced \u2014 an effort that was rebuffed by the DC Circuit and the Supreme Court. Nichols said Navarro\u2019s case presented different issues, and the judge ultimately pointed to the fact that three appeals court judges \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d rejected the arguments Bannon was making in his case. Nichols noted that a member of the DC Circuit panel considering Bannon\u2019s case could have noted in a concurrence or dissent that they had concerns about the key precedent Bannon is seeking to overturn in his case, but no judge on the panel wrote such a statement. With a little less than a month until the surrender date, Bannon could try to file emergency motions with the appeals court and even the Supreme Court seeking to push off his sentence longer.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_trump-prosecute-political-opponents", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is again suggesting he would try to prosecute his political opponents if he\u2019s elected to a second term as he rails against his criminal conviction in New York. \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d\u00a0he told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Wednesday when pressed\u00a0on whether he would use the justice system to go after his political opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible path that they\u2019re leading us to, and it\u2019s very possible that it\u2019s going to have to happen to them,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday. Trump faces the possibility of a prison sentence after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Biden campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler, in a statement responding to Trump\u2019s interview with Hannity, said, \u201cAmerica saw Donald Trump consumed by rage and visibly rattled following his felony conviction; a man who has clearly snapped and whose candidacy is becoming more dangerous by the day. Donald Trump is so consumed with personal grievance that he does not care who he hurts so long as Donald Trump benefits.\u201d But Trump\u2019s suggestions of potentially going after political opponents by weaponizing the Justice Department began more than a year ago, when he was first indicted. He has said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden and his family if he wins a second term and has argued several times he believes he is justified in doing so because Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee criminal investigations that implicate Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a very terrible thing. It\u2019s a terrible precedent for our country. Does that mean the next president does it to them? That\u2019s really the question,\u201d he told Newsmax. The former president still faces charges in three other criminal cases against him, and he has denied any wrongdoing. Trump, who has repeatedly called for the imprisonment of his 2016 Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton despite her never being charged with a crime, also said Tuesday that he thought it would have been a \u201cterrible thing\u201d if Clinton went to jail. Trump recently falsely claimed in an interview with Fox News that he didn\u2019t call to lock up Clinton. \u201cI got a lot of credit from a lot of people, and some people said I should have done it, but, you know, could have, would have been very easy to do it, but I thought it would be a terrible precedent for our country,\u201d Trump said. Trump continued, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be terrible to throw the president\u2019s wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president\u2019s wife, into jail. Wouldn\u2019t that be a terrible thing, but they want to do it.\u201d While Trump\u2019s advisers continue to downplay the idea of Trump being sentenced to prison in the wake of his conviction, the former president is telling allies he thinks he could be put behind bars. Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing has been set for July 11 after a Manhattan jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records last week. Prosecutors accused Trump of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 presidential election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included concealing a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump\u2019s sentence is up to Judge Juan Merchan, and it could include prison time or probation. Trump has told multiple people in recent days that he believes it\u2019s a possibility that he could go to prison and that he\u2019s \u201cOK\u201d with it, according to two sources briefed on the conversations. His lawyers have indicated they believe they have a strong argument against prison given Trump\u2019s age, lack of a criminal record, and contributions to the community. \u201cWe are not planning for him to go to prison,\u201d one campaign adviser insisted to CNN. Earlier this week, Republican National Committee co-chair Michael Whatley said the party was preparing for a scenario in which Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from prison. The convention is slated to kick off on July 15 in Milwaukee, just four days after Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing date. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that right now,\u201d Whatley told Newsmax. \u201cI\u2019m actually going up to Milwaukee this week and we\u2019re going to have a series of conversations. But look, we expect that Donald Trump is going to be in Milwaukee and he\u2019s going to be able to accept that nomination. And if not, we will make whatever contingency planning we need to make for it.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies were unhappy with the framing of Whatley\u2019s remarks, two sources told CNN. The former president\u2019s first campaign event since his conviction is expected to take place Thursday in Phoenix. He will be participating in a town hall hosted by the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point Action. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_cannon-trump-special-counsel-hearing", "text": "Judge Aileen Cannon is again ripping up the court schedule in former President Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case \u2013 pushing some of the legal questions that have been before her for months even further down the road. Cannon\u00a0is planning on holding a sprawling hearing on\u00a0Trump\u2019s request to declare Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel invalid,\u00a0signaling she could be more willing than any other trial judge to veto the special prosecutor\u2019s authority. The planned hearing also adds a new,\u00a0unusual twist in the federal criminal case against the former president:\u00a0Cannon on Tuesday said that a variety of political partisans and constitutional scholars not otherwise involved with the case can join in the oral arguments later this month. It\u2019s an extraordinary elevation of arguments in a criminal case \u2013 filed a year ago this week \u2013 that likely won\u2019t see trial until next year, if at all. Wednesday, Cannon went further, adding a hearing on a\u00a0gag order request from prosecutors\u00a0to limit Trump\u2019s rhetoric about law enforcement\u00a0and allotting more time to hear arguments on the special counsel issue. Cannon will hear arguments on those issues the week of June 21, as well as on the effort by Trump\u00a0to throw out evidence in his case\u00a0that was gathered by the FBI in its 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago or\u00a0provided by his former attorney\u00a0Evan Corcoran to a grand jury. At the same time, she delayed other hearings without setting a new date. The calendar shuffling is the latest example of Cannon\u2019s approach so far to the national security case: scheduling hours in court for arguments that other courts have mostly denied, and pushing off resolution of various legal matters\u00a0\u00a0for months. The delays are a significant legal win for Trump, who also scored a major victory in Georgia on Wednesday, where the state court of appeals put the election subversion conspiracy case there on hold indefinitely. Challenges to special counsel\u2019s office have failed nationwide Similar challenges from Trump and other high-level targets of special counsel probes have flopped from coast to coast in recent years: Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t get anywhere with judges in Los Angeles and Delaware; Paul Manafort\u2019s\u00a0arguments fell flat\u00a0when the former Trump campaign chairman challenged special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s authority; and Andrew Miller, a former\u00a0associate of Roger Stone, also lost his challenge to Mueller\u2019s authority. Even with other federal trial-level judges allowing special counsels\u2019 criminal prosecutions, Cannon could\u00a0rule differently. Cannon\u2019s signal of willingness to entertain challenges to the special counsel comes in the same week Republicans are bearing down on Attorney General Merrick Garland for his use of special counsels. The issue, now before Cannon in the Southern District of Florida federal court, is likely to remain in the political debate at least until Cannon holds a hearing on the legal power of the special counsel to prosecute a defendant, on June 21. Cannon has already taken a drastically different tack from other trial-level federal judges who have handled criminal cases charged by recent special counsel\u2019s offices \u2013 of which there have been five since Trump became president. While others have moved swiftly to trial \u2013 including special counsel David Weiss trying his case against Hunter Biden in Delaware this week, eight months after indictment \u2013 Cannon has moved slowly on pre-trial issues from Trump and his two co-defendants. Many\u00a0of the most substantive legal questions to be decided in the classified records case, which the Justice Department first brought against Trump last June, aren\u2019t yet ripe for a decision. And it is highly unusual for a federal trial judge to allow a third-party group unaffiliated with a criminal case to argue in court as part of a defendant\u2019s legal challenges to the case itself. That work is essentially reserved for defendants\u2019 teams to bring and argue in courts across the country, opposite Justice Department prosecutors. Allowing third parties to argue in court is even rare in appeals situations. \u201cThe fact these motions are even being entertained with a hearing is itself ridiculous. That third parties are being allowed to opine\u00a0at the hearing is absurd,\u201d\u00a0Bradley Moss, a national security law expert based in Washington, DC, told CNN. But Cannon has been convinced by three separate groups of lawyers that they should be able to argue before her. Two of those groups support Trump\u2019s position to dismiss the case against him and say the special counsel, for various constitutional reasons, doesn\u2019t have authority to prosecute. A third group says the Department of Justice\u2019s use of a special counsel should be upheld. Two former Republican-appointed US attorneys general, Edwin Meese and Michael Mukasey, are part of the groups of so-called \u201cfriends of the court\u201d that side with Trump and\u00a0whom Cannon will hear from. The three groups will be allowed to argue, in addition to Justice Department and defendants\u2019 lawyers, for 30 minutes each, according to the court record. Meese and Mukasey have special insight to share with the judge, they say, given their former roles leading the Justice Department. Delayed Trump effort to question federal officials Meanwhile, Cannon on Wednesday delayed a previously scheduled multi-day proceeding where Trump\u2019s team\u00a0wanted\u00a0to question federal government officials under oath about how they conducted the investigation. Trump\u2019s legal team is angling to convince the judge to force the government to turn over\u00a0more records from far-flung offices\u00a0of the executive branch. The special counsel\u2019s office argued to Cannon in person months ago that making federal government officials witnesses at this stage of the case \u2013 as Trump wants \u2013 would be an unprecedented exploitation of the court. Cannon still agreed to the hearing Trump wanted.\u00a0But that hearing is no longer on the schedule.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_biden-anti-trump-republicans", "text": "Donald Trump hasn\u2019t shown much interest in reaching out to Republicans who\u00a0think he\u2019s an existential threat. But Thursday,\u00a0on the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day,\u00a0President Joe Biden will take the first step in trying to win over voters his campaign believes could be the Holy Grail for them in the election, announcing a new national Republican engagement director in what will be a monthslong ramp up into the convention and beyond. Beyond adding former Rep. Adam Kinzinger\u2019s chief of staff Austin Weatherford as the leader of Republican outreach, operatives in Biden\u2019s headquarters in Wilmington have been digging in on focus groups and polling for clues \u2013 particularly about the consistent 20% who kept turning out for Nikki Haley in Republican primaries long after she gave up on her campaign. They muse about Haley-supporting suburban moms focused on national security. They insist there are middle of the road voters exhausted by Trump\u2019s attacks on the Constitution and restoring decency who are ready to find Biden palatable. CNN\u2019s interviews with two dozen Republican officials and aides, as well as multiple people in the White House and Biden campaign, detail the sometimes stilting, always-a-little-awkward conversations underway between liberal, mostly younger aides and frustrated, mostly older Republicans that go far beyond the generic statements about welcoming Haley voters and a few small but targeted online ads that the campaign has publicly announced. Senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn has already met with several potential allies like Cassidy Hutchinson, the former assistant to Trump\u2019s chief of staff who turned on the former president in her testimony to the January 6 committee, according to people told about the meeting. Several campaign aides spent last Wednesday on a Zoom call with two dozen Republican former members of Congress, hearing out their complaints and asking them to get involved. Others who have turned on Trump, like his short-tenured communications director Anthony Scaramucci, have been consulted. Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman, is being deliberately given space to get to what many expect will eventually be a rip-roaring fulfilment of her promise to do what she can to keep Trump from getting back into the Oval Office. And a slate of GOP speakers for the Democratic convention in August and into the fall is being planned, following a similar schedule and roll-out as in 2020, when former Ohio Gov. John Kasich talked about how terrible Trump was and\u00a0Cindy McCain recorded an emotional video\u00a0about Biden\u2019s \u201cfriendship that shouldn\u2019t have worked\u201d with her late husband. In a slide obtained by CNN of the pitch campaign aides made to the Republicans on the Zoom call \u2013 next to photos of Biden meeting with members of the military and greeting young children \u2013 they laid out their wish list, including \u201cHelp us develop tailored outreach plans to recruit high profile Republican endorsements and supporters,\u201d \u201cVolunteer to be surrogates for print, TV, radio, podcasts and digital media stories, including op-Eds,\u201d and \u201cMake yourselves available to bracket key milestones in the Trump campaign,\u201d along with asking for more advice and help notching endorsements from veterans and law enforcement. \u201cRepublicans are leaving Trump in numbers that are well beyond what we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, one of Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign managers and his 2024 campaign chair. The June 27 debate and other contrast points, she predicted, will remind people \u201cabout the chaos and the lack of leadership of Trump\u201d and \u201charden those protest votes.\u201d The presentation to the Republican former lawmakers went further: \u201cMany of you will be having these conversations in ways we could not. We need to create systems for feedback loops to bring your read-outs into our campaign strategy.\u201d But battered and lonely after years of feeling chased out of their own party, many anti-Trump Republican leaders complain they still haven\u2019t heard from the Biden campaign. Agonizing about voting for a Democrat \u2013 even with all they\u2019ve said about the threat they believe Trump represents \u2013 they insist Biden still has to \u201cearn\u201d their votes and that his positions on Israel and other issues are making that harder. They talk in terms like \u201ccreating a permission structure\u201d and \u201cmattering on the margins\u201d as they insist there are more voters like them across the country who don\u2019t want to tell their friends or families \u2013 or even pollsters \u2013 because they fear being attacked, doxxed, swatted and harassed but will vote against Trump once the curtains on the voting booths are pulled tight. But while former Virginia Rep. Denver Riggleman told CNN he dreams of a big locking arms event with Biden and fellow apostate Republicans at the White House and Kinzinger told CNN he has offered advice about making more speeches about the fight for democracy in Ukraine, others say they are disappointed to see higher profile anti-Trump Republicans like former House Speaker Paul Ryan sit out so far. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Trump Vice President Mike Pence have said they can\u2019t vote for either candidate. Neither responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tech billionaire and\u00a0\u201cShark Tank\u201d star Mark Cuban, who supported Haley before popping into a Biden fundraiser in Dallas in March, doesn\u2019t think the decision he\u2019s made is a \u201cbig revelation or change.\u201d \u201cI think Joe is a better choice than Trump. That simple,\u201d he told CNN. He wishes he could have compared Biden and Haley or another Republican on the issues, he said. \u201cI miss those kinds of elections.\u201d But then there\u2019s Larry Hogan, the Republican former governor of Maryland now running for Senate, who \u2013 minutes before the Trump verdict came in last week \u2013 stood at the front of a room in a retirement home in the suburbs north of Baltimore last week nodding along as a man put a different spin on what has become a very familiar question for him: What should be done about \u201cthat one Mr. T \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about the one wearing all the jewelry.\u201d \u201cMr. T, \u2018I pity the fool,\u2019\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWhat a great question.\u201d Hogan, who also endorsed Haley, went into detail about how long he has been critical of Trump, explained that the former president is leading in the polls because Biden has done so badly, \u201cbut I have confidence in the American people that hopefully between now and November, they\u2019re going to make the right decision.\u201d Hogan left out which decision he will make himself. In an interview outside after, he said he wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump or Biden because he doesn\u2019t think either would be a good president and, given that Maryland is expected to be solid blue, \u201cI\u2019m not going to impact the election.\u201d Shortly afterward, Trump campaign officials said Hogan\u2019s campaign should be over because he released a statement saying to respect the New York verdict. Strains over the \u2018neither\u2019 option Many of Haley\u2019s voters were just using her spot on the ballot as a repository for anti-Trump votes, but Republicans and Democrats alike expect most of those voters to \u2013 like the former South Carolina governor \u2013 go back to Trump even if he never does anything to win them over, as she had said he would have to. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican and committed Trump supporter, said that he\u2019s been pushing Trump to do more outreach but isn\u2019t concerned: \u201cWhen it\u2019s Biden-Trump, I think most of them are going to come back. And I think those who don\u2019t come back will be offset by people on the left\u201d abandoning Biden. One person who hasn\u2019t gotten a call: Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas whose 2024 GOP primary campaign never got out of the single digits. On his way out of the Capitol after the unveiling ceremony for Arkansas\u2019s new statue of civil rights leader Daisy Bates, Hutchinson said that the votes for Haley should be \u201ca great concern\u201d for Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to worry that in November you\u2019re going to have a lot of voters that will skip that box and go to a Senate race, or they\u2019re going to stay at home,\u201d Hutchinson said, predicting a repeat of a 2020 phenomenon that boosted down-ballot Republicans and left Trump seething that there must have been a conspiracy against him. Or, he argued, \u201cthey\u2019re likely to stay home.\u201d Hutchinson told CNN he won\u2019t stay home himself, but he won\u2019t vote for Biden or Trump. Prompted with the idea that one of those two is almost certain to be president, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d Indiana Sen. Todd Young \u2013 who has said he won\u2019t be voting for Trump because of the events of January 6, 2021, and other issues, but also won\u2019t be voting for Biden \u2013 was visibly strained when confronted with the question last month of whether there\u2019s anything that the Democrat could do to win his vote. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d Young told CNN after a vote on the Senate floor. Young stepped onto the subway that runs from the Capitol back to his office building and moved to the back of the car so that reporters could not follow him in. Asked as the doors closed whether he saw the election as a binary choice, Young grimaced. \u201cIt typically is,\u201d he said. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency administrator under George W. Bush, who is planning to vote for Biden as she did four years ago, said the \u201cneither\u201d answer is not acceptable. \u201cThey should understand that\u2019s the worst possible response, because what you\u2019re saying, is \u2018I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to be just fine,\u2019\u201d Whitman said, arguing the only excuse is people who might be scared of getting attacked or doxxed or swatted from going public. \u201cAll that does is empower people that you don\u2019t want to be empowered.\u201d But Whitman, who in 2020 was the national chair of Republicans and Independents for Biden, has not heard from the Biden campaign this time. Joe Walsh, the former Illinois congressman who briefly ran a 2020 primary challenge against Trump, was blunter. \u201cI understand it: They\u2019re utter cowards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to not be a Republican anymore. As bad as they think Biden is on policy, they know Trump is unfit.\u201d Dreams of rebuilding a traditional GOP Some anti-Trump Republicans who don\u2019t want their party to be this way have tried to get themselves into a familiar Zen: Trump would serve four more years, they figure, probably pass some tax cuts they would agree with, and then he would fade because he wouldn\u2019t be running for president anymore. Some feel like they fought Trump as long as they could but think now is the time to accept that they lost and make the best of it. Some insist they remain the true Republican Party and see 2024 as the chance to wrest it back from the pretenders they see in Trump and others who have followed him to the point of wearing marching long red ties, that their votes for Biden will be the first steps in rebuilding a Republican Party where Reaganism rises again over MAGA. \u201cWho are the real Republicans \u2013 the Maggots or people like me, who believe in markets, who believe in family, who believe in a military that is strong but also diplomacy? I maintain that I\u2019m the real Republican and the Maggots are not. They are the RINOs,\u201d said Claudine Schneider, a former Republican congresswoman from Rhode Island, using a derogatory riff on MAGA and the \u201cRepublicans in Name Only\u201d acronym Trump often uses for Republicans who don\u2019t support him. Schneider said traditional Republican values should point to Biden. While she said she has heard the complaints he has veered too far left, investments like infrastructure and the CHIPS and Science Act are what her fellow Republicans should support \u2013 and also, she added, because \u201che, I believe, can be trusted. He has integrity. And that cannot be said of the other guy whose life is all about lying and cheating.\u201d Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia and current CNN contributor, broke with Trump and\u00a0wrote an op-ed in May saying he was voting for Biden and encouraging other Republicans to join him. He explained that he hoped he could be the bridge both to more bipartisan policy out of Biden and for voters to reject Trump and start sending non-MAGA Republicans to Congress. \u201cThis is a really easy play: We need about 10 million Republicans to say, \u2018Enough. Enough, enough, enough \u2013 we can no longer fake the fact that Donald Trump is a real Republican,\u2019\u201d Duncan said, imagining that if 10 million Republicans vote in down-ballot candidates, then during a Biden second term, \u201cwe give ourselves four years to hit the reset button, rebuild the Republican Party.\u201d Duncan said he started to make the case on the bipartisanship to Biden when the president called him to thank him for the op-ed and felt good about the conversation. But on Israel, immigration and other top policy areas, frustration among Republican leaders with Biden remains high, as does skepticism among Republicans that he is interested in sincere compromise with them at the risk of aggravating his own base. \u201cThis swath of Republican strategist types are literally begging the Biden campaign to give them a reason to support him,\u201d a former House Republican leadership aide told CNN. \u201c\u2018Will he do that?\u2019 is the unanswered question.\u201d Two Bushes, neither in hand for Biden George H.W. Bush put out word in 2016 that he voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump. People involved tell CNN that Biden\u2019s campaign reached out to George W. Bush in 2020 to see about an endorsement then but came up short \u2013 the only other living Republican president wanted to stick to his philosophy that ex-presidents should stay out of direct politics. That didn\u2019t stop his clearly non-MAGA worldview from slipping out several times over Trump\u2019s presidency, conspicuously very quickly congratulating Biden after the election was called and condemning January 6 in a statement, \u201cI am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.\u201d Though Bush\u2019s popularity has plummeted among Republicans overall, \u201che\u2019s obviously the biggest voice of any of us. He\u2019s a decent man,\u201d said Kinzinger. \u201cIt would certainly give a permission for a lot of people. There are still Bush Republicans left that are voting for Trump grudgingly, and they just don\u2019t know their party has left them yet.\u201d Responding to radio host Howard Stern last month asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Jeb Bush? Where\u2019s George Bush? Why don\u2019t they say \u2018Hey, I\u2019m interested in saving democracy for our grandchildren?\u2019\u201d Biden said only, \u201cWell \u2013 I don\u2019t think the election is over yet on that score.\u201d Asked about whether that meant there were conversations underway and if he would consider voting for Biden in November, Jeb Bush, who has taken to tweeting approvingly about articles that decry the state of American politics, told CNN by email that he wasn\u2019t going to comment, but \u201cthanks for thinking of me.\u201d In the Maryland Senate race, Hogan said Bush called to urge him to get in because, Hogan recalled the former president, saying, \u201cI think you\u2019re the voice to get us back on track.\u201d Hogan said Bush had been disappointed he hadn\u2019t run in the Republican presidential primary against Trump \u2013 but added that he would be surprised if 43 weighed in directly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to interfere,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t still have opinions and he doesn\u2019t still care about things.\u201d A spokesman for the former president also declined comment. \u201cYou can hold your nose and vote for Biden and not be in public screaming about it. You can mark your ballot, vote to keep this democracy going instead of voting affirmatively to end it,\u201d said Kristopher Purcell, an operative who in 2020 was on the organizing committee for a group called 43 Alumni for Biden. But Purcell has also not yet heard from the Biden campaign this time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-anti-trump-republicans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}

We call on Hamas to close this agreement,\u00a0that Israel is ready to move forward with, and begin the process of releasing our citizens,\u201d the statement says. \u201cAt this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages, as well as those on both sides of this terrible conflict, including the civilian populations.\u201d The United States, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom signed the joint statement.\u00a0Those 17 countries have citizens whom Hamas took captive at the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The statement marks one more example of the Biden administration\u2019s ongoing pressure campaign to push Hamas and Israel to get to a \u201cyes\u201d on an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Biden took the unusual step last week of publicly detailing in a speech what he said were the details of Israel\u2019s latest ceasefire offer to Hamas, in the hopes of fueling progress in the negotiations. Asserting that Hamas had been degraded to such a point that it could no longer carry out an October 7-like attack again, Biden described a three-stage proposal that would ultimately result in a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire\u201d and the release of the hostages. \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end,\u201d the president said. Immediately after Biden detailed the Israeli proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that his country would not end the war until Hamas was defeated. Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, convened for the first time last month an in-person meeting of ambassadors and chiefs of mission representing countries whose citizens were taken hostage by Hamas, CNN reported, at a moment when a deal was stalled. During that in-person meeting in Washington, the group discussed ideas to secure the release of the hostages in Gaza, with a particular focus on ways that they could speak more as a collective group in both public and private settings. The ambassadors and chief of missions gathered with Sullivan had brainstormed ways to exert pressure on the negotiating parties \u2013 including Israel, Egypt and Qatar \u2013 to return to the negotiating table and finalize a ceasefire agreement, sources told CNN at the time. Senior US officials including CIA Director Bill Burns and White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk have also returned to the Middle East this week in an effort to add traction to the ceasefire negotiations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/hamas-israel-hostages-ceasefire-countries-statement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_senate-vote-contraception-access", "text": "Senate Republicans voted Wednesday to block a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to contraception nationwide, as Democrats seek to highlight the issue in the run up to November\u2019s elections. The bill \u2013 the Right to Contraception Act \u2013 would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to buy and use contraceptives, as well as for health care providers to provide them. It would apply to birth control pills, the plan B pill, condoms and other forms of contraception. The legislation failed to advance in a procedural vote by a tally of 51 to 39. Most Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that is unnecessary and overly broad. GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill. Schumer switched his vote to a no at the last minute in a procedural move that will allow Democrats to bring the bill back up in the future if they want. \u201cThis is a show vote. It\u2019s not serious,\u201d GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s a huge overreach. It doesn\u2019t make any exceptions for conscience. \u2026 It\u2019s a phony vote because contraception, to my knowledge, is not illegal. It\u2019s not unavailable.\u201d The vote is part of a larger push by Senate Democrats to draw attention to how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has affected all aspects of reproductive health \u2013 not just abortion \u2013 as the election draws closer. Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cIn the coming weeks, Senate Democrats will put reproductive freedoms front and center before this chamber, so that the American people can see for themselves who will stand up to defend their fundamental liberties,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote. Democratic senators have also introduced a legislative package to establish a nationwide right to in-vitro fertilization, which is expected to come up for a vote as soon as next week. That follows an Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that the destruction of embryos could be considered \u201cwrongful deaths.\u201d While the state\u2019s Legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation. \u201cIn the nearly two years since the Supreme Court threw out Roe v. Wade, our nation has seen the horrific consequences of Republicans\u2019 anti-science, anti-woman crusade that has put IVF at risk for millions of Americans who rely on it to start or grow their family,\u201d said\u00a0Illinois Democratic Sen.\u00a0Tammy\u00a0Duckworth, who\u00a0has\u00a0conceived through IVF. Republicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception in an effort to prove\u00a0that\u00a0Democrats are\u00a0unfairly attempting to paint them as extreme.\u00a0GOP Sens. Katie Britt and Ted Cruz introduced\u00a0a bill called the IVF Protection Act in May, and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst has\u00a0put forward\u00a0a separate bill to promote access to contraception. \u201cWe will have an alternative that will make very clear that Republicans are for contraception,\u201d Senate GOP Whip John Thune said. Ahead of the vote on the Democrat-led bill, Ernst attempted to pass her alternative contraception bill by unanimous consent, but the request was blocked by Democrats. Asked how her effort is different from what Democrats want, Ernst said, \u201cIt does not include Plan B, which many folks on the right would consider abortive services.\u00a0Big distinction.\u00a0We want to prevent a pregnancy, not end a pregnancy.\u201d The emergency contraceptive pill sold as Plan B One-Step does not prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb and does not cause an abortion, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. The pill, which is a strong dose of the birth control hormone levonorgestrel, prevents or delays the release of an egg from a woman\u2019s ovary \u2013 a step that occurs well before pregnancy. Democrats have argued that the GOP-led bills fall short, with\u00a0Democratic Sen. Patty\u00a0Murray arguing that Britt and Cruz\u2019s IVF legislation would not actually protect the procedure, noting that the bill does not address the destruction of embryos. \u201cUnlike GOP legislation that would not protect IVF and is only a PR tool for Republicans to hide their extremism, our\u00a0\ufeffRight to IVF Act\u00a0would actually protect Americans from attempts to restrict IVF and would allow more people to access these vital services at a lower cost,\u201d she said. Democrats on Tuesday focused on reproductive health care during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing titled \u201cThe Assault on Women\u2019s Freedoms.\u201d After the hearing, Murray told reporters that \u201cwomen\u2019s experiences are too personal for Republicans to spin, and the record of the Republican party is too clear for them to deny.\u201d The Democrat-led bill to guarantee access to contraception was introduced by Democratic Sens. Ed Markey, Mazie Hirono and Duckworth. CNN\u2019s Brenda Goodman contributed to the report. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_bob-nadine-menendez-mercedes", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s federal corruption trial continued Wednesday with an FBI special agent reading text messages from a New Jersey businessman who is alleged to have made payments on a Mercedes-Benz convertible for the senator\u2019s wife. FBI special agent Rachel Graves combed through countless text messages and documents from 2018 and 2019 detailing Jose Uribe\u2019s involvement in the bribery scheme. Uribe was indicted alongside Menendez but struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors earlier this year. Under the terms of the deal, he pleaded guilty to seven counts and agreed to testify in the government\u2019s case. Bob and Nadine Menendez, along with New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. Prosecutor Paul Michael Monteleoni spent Wednesday morning in federal court in New York unraveling the complex web of communication that allegedly led to Nadine Menendez\u2019s ownership of a Mercedes-Benz C300 convertible car. Prosecutors allege that Uribe made payments for the car in exchange for the senator\u2019s help in influencing New Jersey state criminal prosecutions of two Uribe associates. One of them, Elvis Parra, was charged with insurance fraud in New Jersey. Evidence showed Uribe frequently texted and called Hana and Nadine Menendez, who prosecutors say was the intermediary for communications to the senator. In April 2018, Uribe texted Hana that \u201cthe deal is to kill and stop all investigation I am talking to Andy and he is falling asleep,\u201d referring to the investigation into Parra and to Andy Aslanian, a New Jersey attorney and associate of Nadine Menendez who was present at meetings with the senator, Hana and Egyptian officials. By October 2018, however, Uribe appeared to have grown worried over his involvement, texting Hana, \u201cI am f**ked man\u201d and \u201cthe whole thing is going bad. I have no face to talk to my family.\u201d On October 13, 2018, Uribe texted Hana, \u201cMorning sir, please make sure your friend knows about this, just as a last favor.\u201d Prosecutors allege that the \u201cfriend\u201d in question was a reference to either Bob or Nadine Menendez. \u201cI will,\u201d Hana replied. The texts discussing Parra continued through 2019. In January, Nadine, who was Menendez\u2019s girlfriend at the time, asked Hana, \u201cI need to know what the charges are.\u201d Hana replied, \u201cthe matter only involves four counts\u201d and is \u201ca relatively small indictment.\u201d A few minutes later, Nadine called the senator. Texts from March 2019 revealed further worries for Uribe. On March 5, he texted Hana, \u201cCan\u2019t even sleep.\u201d A week later, he told an associate after an 18-minute call with Nadine that \u201cThey are saying everything is done.\u201d Uribe texted Nadine days later, \u201cI am trusting you.\u201d Meanwhile, in February 2019, Hana asked Daibes by text if he could \u201cplease help \u2026 with car.\u201d A day later, Nadine texted Hana, \u201call is great I am so excited to get a car next week.\u201d Prosecutors have alleged that Nadine Menendez needed a new car, apparently after hitting and killing a jaywalker in Bogota, New Jersey, in December 2018. A police report was filed but she faced no charges. On March 31, 2019, Nadine texted the senator photos of two different Mercedes-Benz cars and asked which he preferred. Menendez replied, \u201clike them both whatever you prefer.\u201d But Nadine soon grew upset with Hana because she said he\u2019d left for Egypt for a week and she hadn\u2019t obtained a car, according to texts. In a March 31 text, she told Uribe, \u201cI just found out Wael left for Egypt yesterday. I am very hurt and disappointed by him but I should not be surprised.\u201d Uribe texted her back, \u201cI was hoping to meet with you \u2026 I am worried but I have to face whatever comes my way.\u201d The two then had a 22-minute phone call and a little over an hour later, Nadine texted Menendez that Uribe had made a call to \u201cmake the arrangements for my car.\u201d On April 5, 2019, Nadine texted the senator, \u201cCongratulations mon amour de la vie we are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes.\u201d The federal indictment alleges that Nadine Menendez obtained $15,000 in cash from Uribe in a parking lot the day before she picked the vehicle up and put $15,000 as a down payment. Uribe is alleged to have then hidden his monthly financing payments for the vehicle. Later, following an FBI raid on the Menendez home, Nadine would write Uribe a $21,000 check, which prosecutors say was an effort at cleanup and to make the gift look like a loan. Uribe is scheduled to be sentenced on June 14. CNN\u2019s Zachary B.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_republicans-revenge-tour-2024-trump", "text": "In the wake of former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s felony conviction, the\u00a0\u201cR\u201d\u00a0in the Republican brand might just as well stand for revenge. From Trump on down,\u00a0members of the GOP\u00a0are launching furious plans to prosecute Democrats at every turn, especially if the man who lost the White House in 2020 can win it back this fall. Trump nodded to the idea when asked about his conviction, which he has persistently, and with no evidence, blamed on President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible path that they are leading us to,\u201d Trump said on the conservative channel Newsmax, \u201cand it\u2019s very possible that it\u2019s going to have to happen to them.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies have taken up that drumbeat with fury. \u201cI\u2019m quite frankly pissed off,\u201d Texas Republican\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Ronny Jackson told Newsmax. \u201cPresident Biden should be ready,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cbecause on January 20 of next year when he\u2019s former President Joe Biden \u2026 I\u2019m going to encourage all of my colleagues and everybody that I have any influence over as a member of Congress to aggressively go after the president and his entire family, his entire crime family, for all of the misdeeds that are out there right now.\u201d Seizing on the special counsel prosecution of Biden\u2019s son Hunter is clearly, for many of them, just a warm up. Less than a year ago, Trump vowed:\u00a0\u201cI will appoint a real special \u2018prosecutor\u2019 to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden, the entire Biden crime family, & all others involved in the destruction of our elections, borders, & country itself!\u201d Calls for arrests, jail time\u00a0and\u00a0even worse have ricocheted throughout right-wing media with renewed intensity since a\u00a0New York jury delivered its\u00a0guilty verdict. Much of it is aimed at Biden, but there is plenty of anger to go around. Former Trump adviser and far-right firebrand, Steve Bannon, wants Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg jailed, and he suggested to the New York Times that Republican prosecutors coast-to-coast should start building cases against Democrats. \u201cThere are dozens of ambitious, backbencher state attorneys general and district attorneys who need to \u2018seize the day\u2019 and own this moment in history,\u201d Bannon said. Bannon faces trial himself this fall after being indicted by Bragg over allegations he defrauded donors through a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. He has pleaded not guilty. Another former Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, is sounding the same battle cry. \u201cEvery facet of Republican party politics and power has to be used right now to go toe-to-toe with Marxism and beat these communists!\u201d Miller said on Fox News this week as he ticked through an action agenda. \u201cIs every Republican AG opening investigations into voter fraud, right now? Is every House committee controlled by Republicans using its subpoena power in every way it needs to, right now? Is every Republican DA starting every investigation it needs to, right now?\u201d Speaker of the House\u00a0Mike Johnson has announced a \u201cthree-pronged approach\u201d to reining in the\u00a0US\u00a0Department of Justice, which has been repeatedly savaged by Trump. Johnson is promising to use appropriations, legislation and oversight to muzzle the department for, as he sees it, undermining American faith in the judicial process. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than just President Trump. It\u2019s bigger than just these cases. It\u2019s about our system itself, and because of that, there is a backlash,\u201d he said. It all dovetails with a massive plan of action being pushed by the Heritage Foundation should Trump be\u00a0reelected\u00a0\u2013 a plan that calls for the Department of Justice to be no longer treated as an independent body making decisions based on law. Under Project 2025, as it is called, the DOJ would come under \u201cthe direct supervision and control of the President,\u201d who would be free to determine who was charged for what, and to see that cases were \u201cmade consistent with the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d Some top Democrats have long predicted a wave of retribution should Trump win\u00a0reelection, especially for sharp critics of the now presumptive GOP nominee, journalists who highlight Trump\u2019s lies and misdeeds and for members of the January 6 select committee. Former congresswoman and the committee\u2019s vice chair\u00a0Liz Cheney has drawn special attention, with Trump earlier this year posting on his social media platform, \u201cShe should go to\u00a0Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!\u201d A raging sea of Republicans is now, without doubt, hoping to see that retribution brought to reality.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/republicans-revenge-tour-2024-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_takeaways-hunter-biden-day-3", "text": "The third day of the Hunter Biden trial saw his ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend testify\u00a0in vivid detail about his drug addiction. Also introduced\u00a0as evidence Wednesday\u00a0was the gun Biden bought in October 2018 that\u2019s at the center of the charges against him. The salesman who sold Biden the gun testified that he saw him fill out the federal form\u00a0on which\u00a0he\u2019s accused of falsely claiming\u00a0he wasn\u2019t using drugs. As the day wrapped up, prosecut\ufeffors announced that they have a half-dozen \u201cshorter\u201d\u00a0witnesses remaining\u00a0and might be prepared to rest their case as soon as\u00a0Thursday afternoon. After that, Biden\u2019s defense lawyers can put on a case\u00a0if they want to. Here\u2019s what to know from Day 3: A tale of two exes When Biden\u2019s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, who prosecutors subpoenaed to testify, took the witness stand, members of the jury sat up straight in their seats, leaned in and started tuning in. But Buhle\u2019s brief, staccato answers and subdued tone didn\u2019t seem to pull in the jurors. Buhle told the jury that in 2018, she found drug paraphernalia in Hunter\u2019s car, which she checked occasionally because she wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything illegal in the vehicle \u201cwhen my daughters would use his car.\u201d\u00a0However, Buhle couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly when in 2018 she found paraphernalia in Hunter\u2019s car. Zoe Kestan, another one of Hunter\u2019s former romantic partners, proved to be a much more captivating witness for the jury.\u00a0She described months of partying, clubbing and helping him score drugs from California to Rhode Island. Biden also gave her a brief wave when she identified him in court. Her delivery was animated, and she volunteered interesting details in her answers, sprinkling in the names of upscale restaurants that they dined at in New York City and which fancy hotels they stayed at in Los Angeles. It seemed like some of the jurors were hanging on every word she said. More importantly for the prosecutors\u2019 case, Kestan provided direct eyewitness testimony of Hunter Biden doing drugs as late as mid-September 2018, several weeks before he bought the gun. She said she watched him smoking crack during one of their liaisons in Malibu. This is the closest that prosecutors have come so far to connecting the timeline of Hunter\u2019s drug use to his gun purchase. The \u2018whale hunter\u2019 The salesman who sold Hunter the gun, Gordon Cleveland, testified as a prosecution witness and told the jury that he watched Hunter Biden mark \u201cno\u201d on the question of whether he was a user of illegal drugs. That is essential testimony for the special counsel. Counts 1 and 2 of the three-count felony indictment are tied directly to Hunter\u2019s alleged false statement on that form about his drug use. Later, when he was cross-examined by Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell, Cleveland embraced his reputation as a \u201cwhale hunter,\u201d chuckling when Lowell brought up the term and bragging about his ability to close deals for pricey guns. Lowell is pursuing this line of inquiry because in opening statements he told the jury that Cleveland essentially peddled the gun to Biden. \u201cI could sell whatever you had. It\u2019s just what I did,\u201d Cleveland said, explaining why his colleagues called him a whale hunter. This included attempts to push his customers to buy more expensive guns, he conceded. But Cleveland said he did that because the pricier guns are more reliable and high quality and wouldn\u2019t try to sell \u201cjunk\u201d to customers. He \u201cwas making the same pay\u201d if someone was buying a gun or not. More embarrassing Hunter photos Pictures of a hotel room that Hunter Biden shared with Kestan in 2018 were shown to the jury. Kestan pointed out several crack pipes, one of which was broken, as well as baking powder, spoons, bowls and chop sticks \u2013 all used for the drugs he was taking and the cocaine he was cooking into crack, she testified. Prosecutors showed a photo of Hunter Biden wearing a shirt that said \u201cADDICTED,\u201d with an Adidas logo that was made to look like a marijuana plant. \u201cI thought that was funny because he didn\u2019t smoke weed,\u201d Kestan said. Another image shown to the jury was of Hunter Biden in a bathtub holding what Kestan said was a crackpipe. What\u2019s next? In opening statements, prosecutors signaled a specific order for their expected witnesses, and they suggested that after Buhle and Kestan testified, they\u2019d put Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, on the stand. However, after Kestan finished, prosecutors moved on to Gordon, to testify about the gun sale. It\u2019s not clear what may have motivated the potential order adjustment, and it\u2019s still expected that Hallie will testify, perhaps on Thursday, as prosecutors wind down their case. But there was high anticipation for Hallie\u2019s testimony on Wednesday. After all, she represents Biden family drama \u2013 after losing Beau to brain cancer in 2015, she started dating his brother Hunter, who \u201cintroduced\u201d her to crack cocaine, which she later started using herself. In addition to Hallie Biden, prosecutors are aiming to present testimony from several federal agents, including DEA officials who can describe various drug lingo that came up in Hunter Biden\u2019s texts.

On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-progressives-immigration", "text": "Joe Biden is pushing progressives who are already sour on his presidency to the limit with a tough new executive action barring most asylum applications from migrants crossing the US-Mexico border illegally. But the president\u2019s weakness on one of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest campaign issues means it\u2019s a risk that he has no option but to take. People familiar with Biden\u2019s strategy pointed out privately that he was in the position of taking bold action on immigration after Republicans in Congress refused to act after killing a bipartisan immigration bill to please their presumptive nominee. If Biden wins November\u2019s election, it will probably be because he was able to cement the most disaffected liberal Democrats behind him, while appealing to moderates and dissenting Republicans who reject Trump\u2019s extremism. Many of the latter group feel that the border crisis is a matter of urgent national security, and Biden needs to show he takes the presidential duty of securing the homeland seriously. But the president has been on dicey ground with his party\u2019s most liberal members for months, and his standing with progressives has weakened dangerously over his support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks. The party schism will be on graphic display when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses Congress in the coming weeks \u2014 honoring an invitation that originated with Republicans keen to maximize Biden\u2019s political distress. The president\u2019s dilemma is so significant because of signs that the coalition that carried him to power over Trump four years ago has eroded. His support in polling compared to his performance four years ago has been especially shaky among liberal voters and people of color. In a knife-edge election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, every Democrat who doesn\u2019t show up for Biden is effectively a vote for his rival. The election may well turn on another Biden vulnerability \u2014 high prices and interest rates \u2014 or it could be decided by his warnings that Trump is unfit for office and a danger to democracy. But polls show voters are increasingly concerned about immigration. Of all issues tested, Biden recorded his lowest approval rating on immigration in a CNN poll in February \u2014 just 30%. Loud dissent from progressives on Biden\u2019s immigration moves The executive action, which is designed to alleviate the pressure on a hopelessly swamped asylum system, differs in important ways from the draconian policies of Trump \u2014 a point Biden was at pains to stress on Tuesday by emphasizing that he\u2019s not sending the military to lock people up before mass deportations, as the former president has said he plans to do. The Biden measure includes exceptions for unaccompanied minors and people who are deemed to be victims of a \u201csevere form\u201d of human trafficking. And the restrictions can be lifted if migrant arrivals fall well below current levels. But the act of wielding executive power to thwart any asylum applications strikes many progressives as a betrayal of liberal values, morally repugnant and counter to the country\u2019s historic mission. Biden addressed those Democrats directly on Tuesday at the White House. \u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you \u2026\u00a0 be patient \u2026 (the) good will of the American people \u2026 is wearing thin right now,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing nothing is not an option.\u00a0We have to act.\u201d Progressives are not just angry that the president\u2019s actions curtail asylum rights for desperate migrants fleeing repression, economic blight, trafficking, gang violence and other forms of political and social intimidation in South and Central America. The fear is that Biden\u2019s position will be the new orthodoxy for Democratic immigration initiatives going forward. These Democratic critics also despair that there\u2019s no path to citizenship for millions of migrants already in the country \u2014 including those brought to the US as children who are in limbo with no legal status. \u201cOnce again, no relief for Dreamers, farmworkers,\u201d Sen. Alex Padilla told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju.\u00a0Asked whether Biden could be hurt with progressive and Hispanic voters, the California Democrat replied: \u201cI guess there\u2019s still time for him to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Biden points out that he\u2019d rather act with Congress and that Republicans refused to pass the most conservative immigration bill in decades that would have paid for extra border patrol officers and poured resources into the stretched asylum system. But even that measure was stripped of many of the measures that Democrats traditionally seek to include in comprehensive immigration plans. Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Pramila Jayapal voiced a complaint shared by many liberals that Biden can\u2019t win votes by trying to match the Republican Party\u2019s march to the right. \u201cWe are making the same mistake again that Democrats continually make when we try to out-Republican the Republicans; it does not work,\u201d the Washington state Democrat said. Texas Rep. Greg Casar said Republicans \u201ctry to cover up their failures for this country by scapegoating immigrants and by trying to point to the border and to immigrants as the source of all of our problems,\u201d adding that it is \u201cunfortunate that President Biden is responding to those politics\u201d with this action. Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley added: \u201cWith all due respect Mr. President, we should not be unearthing policies from the last administration.\u201d Any president who disappoints his own supporters is in a perilous place when seeking reelection. Biden has shown throughout his term that he is conscious that the grassroots of his party is shifting left. He\u2019s granted billions of dollars in student loan relief \u2014 despite his efforts being thwarted by the courts and blasted by Republicans as illegal. He\u2019s tried to revive US manufacturing with hundreds of millions of dollars in public spending in his bipartisan infrastructure plan. And he\u2019s passed the most significant climate change legislation in America history, even if the measures fell short of what progressives had initially hoped for. Biden has also courted key figures on the progressive left, including Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran against him in the 2020 Democratic primary. Progressives face their own dilemma Biden would never say it bluntly in public, but his gamble with progressives carries an implicit question \u2014 where else are they going to go? Will they instead vote for a Republican demagogue who borrowed Adolf Hitler\u2019s language while warning that immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country? Will progressives and Arab Americans really stay home in the key swing state of Michigan and give an opening to a former president who called for a Muslim ban? This is a risky proposition for Biden, and some Democrats privately fear that the deaths of thousands of Palestinians in Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza could be the kind of burning single moral issue that could depress significant votes in Michigan. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who represents the battleground state\u2019s 12th Congressional District, got a lot of attention last month when she warned that there would be a price to pay for Biden and other Democrats who she said smeared pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to forget in November are we?\u201d Tlaib said. The congresswoman\u2019s remarks followed a campaign in the Michigan Democratic presidential primary that led more than 100,000 people to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d because of Biden\u2019s support for Israel. The protests did not come with a commitment for voters to desert the president in November, and Trump, obviously, was not on the ballot. But anything like that loss of Democratic votes could spell big trouble for Biden in the general election. Still, Biden\u2019s comeback after a terrible start in the 2020 primary is a reminder that the loudest progressive voices do not necessarily represent the critical center of a party. Biden did especially well with moderate and Black voters, especially women, whose views may resonate as much as those of frequently quoted progressive leaders in Washington. And there are some scenarios in which being rebuked by voters like Tlaib may help Biden with the voters he most needs to beat Trump in November. \u201cBroadly speaking, for her to attack Joe Biden in this way probably helps him politically,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden White House communications director, said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d last month. \u201cI think the majority of voters he\u2019s trying to win over, frankly the majority of voters in this country, are, broadly speaking, supportive of Israel, want to see us stand by our ally there. And I think if someone who is representing the farthest left of the party \u2026 if she\u2019s attacking Joe Biden, that probably helps him with the voters that he needs.\u201d One vital slice of the electorate the Biden campaign would love to impress are the Republican voters who chose former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley over Trump even months after she suspended her presidential primary campaign. Some Haley supporters on Tuesday welcomed Biden\u2019s immigration actions, CNN\u2019s Kit Maher reported. \u201cWhile many Haley voters continue to have policy differences, this common-sense action is a clear step in the right direction to address one of the top priorities of many Haley voters,\u201d the Haley Voters Working Group, a coalition of approximately 25 conservative Haley supporters, posted on X. The group is far too small to be representative. But expanding tiny seams of potential support is the critical work of grassroots campaigning in very tight elections. A Biden campaign official met with the group for a Zoom call last month. Amanda Stewart Sprowls, a Haley supporter from Arizona, told CNN Biden\u2019s actions on Tuesday were a \u201cshow of good faith\u201d and added: \u201cThey\u2019re starting to listen to the center.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-progressives-immigration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_biden-administration-allies-hamas-ceasefire", "text": "The Biden administration has spent the last week pushing\u00a0allies in the\u00a0Middle East\u00a0to make specific threats to Hamas, as part of an urgent campaign to push the group toward accepting the latest Israeli ceasefire and hostage proposal\u00a0that would pause the fighting in Gaza. US officials have publicly called on\u00a0the group\u00a0to accept previous\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0proposals on the table as Israel and Hamas\u00a0have engaged\u00a0in months of back-and-forth negotiations, but\u00a0there has never been an all-out\u00a0pressure campaign marked by specific asks to individual countries\u00a0as part of\u00a0the Biden administration\u2019s push. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has\u00a0held almost a dozen calls\u00a0with key players in\u00a0the region since Friday\u00a0and\u00a0other top State Department officials have been intimately involved in the all-hands on deck effort. White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk traveled to Egypt this week and\u00a0CIA Director Bill Burns went to\u00a0Qatar\u00a0in the hopes of adding traction to the negotiations,\u00a0but US officials have remained largely mum on the trips so far, citing the sensitivity of the ongoing\u00a0diplomatic work. An initial response from Hamas on Wednesday\u00a0to the most recent Israeli proposal, as publicly described by President Joe Biden last week,\u00a0appeared to\u00a0signal that the\u00a0gaps may still be significant.\u00a0While it welcomed what Biden laid out, upon seeing the proposal brought by mediators, Hamas said that it \u201cturned out to be devoid of the positive foundations contained in Biden\u2019s statements.\u201d \u201cIt does not guarantee a permanent ceasefire, but rather a temporary one\u201d and allows for Israeli forces to remain in Gaza territory, the group said\u00a0in a statement obtained by CNN. Still,\u00a0the Biden administration believes there is\u00a0an opportunity to close the deal, one US official\u00a0said. A different source told CNN Thursday that\u00a0Egypt has received encouraging signs from Hamas on the latest proposal, though they declined to detail exactly what those positive indications were. Hamas is expected to respond to Israel\u2019s proposal in the coming days, sources said. As the Israel-Hamas conflict is on the eve of entering its ninth month, US officials are urging Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to turn up the heat on Hamas by using multiple pressure points.\u00a0They\u2019ve asked multiple countries to threaten\u00a0to\u00a0freeze\u00a0the bank accounts of Hamas members and\u00a0clamp\u00a0down on\u00a0their\u00a0ability to freely travel in the region, according to two US officials. In many cases,\u00a0members of Hamas have long been able to operate\u00a0freely\u00a0despite members of the\u00a0terror\u00a0group. The US has urged Qatar \u2013\u00a0who allows Hamas to operate a political office in its capital \u2013 to declare that it will kick out the terrorist group if they don\u2019t accept the deal, according to\u00a0one of those\u00a0US officials. After months of telling Hamas that they could\u00a0risk getting kicked out, Qatar has now actually made that threat,\u00a0that official said. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said on Wednesday that the US\u00a0has seen both Egypt and Qatar \u201cexert significant pressure on Hamas,\u201d but he refused to get into the details of those separate pressure campaigns. \u201cWe have seen both countries play I think an incredibly important role in mediating this deal, in making clear that this deal is in the interests of the Palestinian people, and doing so appropriately,\u201d Miller said. US officials privately say that Egypt is putting more pressure on Hamas than they have in the past, but the specifics of exactly how far the Egyptians have gone in their private dialogue with\u00a0the group\u00a0remain\u00a0unclear.\u00a0They say the US wants Cairo to threaten to cut off the access points from Egypt to Gaza, a key lifeline for the enclave. Biden unleashed the pressure campaign The Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0intense\u00a0pressure campaign coincides with\u00a0Biden\u2019s speech\u00a0last\u00a0Friday declaring that Hamas must accept the Israeli proposal on the table.\u00a0Biden laid out three phases of a\u00a0deal that\u00a0he said the Israelis\u00a0had\u00a0transmitted to Hamas\u00a0the night before he spoke. \u201cAnd as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposals, \u2018the cessation of hostilities permanently,\u2019\u201d Biden said of the deal. The Biden administration had been considering Biden\u00a0giving a speech\u00a0addressing the Israeli public for some time and\u00a0last week\u2019s address came together quickly as an opportunity to do so. \u201cIt was a very busy weekend after the president\u2019s speech, with everyone working the phones, talking to regional interlockers and pressing them to get Hamas to accept the deal,\u201d\u00a0one US\u00a0official said. As US officials have feverishly gamed out every lever they can pull,\u00a0there has been private acknowledgement by some that there is no\u00a0plan B for what would happen if Hamas comes back with a rejection\u00a0\u2013 a reality that\u00a0adds to the\u00a0weight of this moment. The US political calendar also remains a key factor.\u00a0US officials\u00a0had hoped for the war to end by the beginning of the calendar year, well before the presidential campaign\u2019s general election got underway. But with the ceasefire negotiations halting to a stop at multiple junctures, now, the Democratic National Convention where Biden is set to formally receive his party\u2019s nomination is now\u00a0less than three months away, adding to the urgency\u00a0that Biden allies feel as the backlash against the war only continues to mount at home. And now, one week after the latest Israeli proposal was transmitted to Hamas, it remains unclear if the pressure campaign will succeed. US officials say they have a decent idea of how to exert pressure that would impact the members of Hamas who are operating outside of the battlefield in Gaza, but the paramount challenge is convincing\u00a0Yahya Sinwar \u2013 Hamas\u2019 leader\u00a0in Gaza\u00a0who is believed to be hiding underground\u00a0\u2013 to accept the deal. Miller acknowledged Wednesday that Sinwar might not see it as in his interest to accept the deal on the table.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-administration-allies-hamas-ceasefire/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_georgia-trump-fani-willis-trial-delay", "text": "A Georgia appeals court has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Donald Trump and several of his co-defendants \u2013 a massive victory for the former president seeking to push further legal issues until 2025 if he can\u2019t beat them altogether. The new order filed on Wednesday from the Georgia Court of Appeals is the latest indication that a trial in the state-level Georgia election subversion case will not occur before the 2024 presidential election. The court said the case will be on hold until a panel of judges rules on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified. The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, though it could issue a ruling sooner. Several\u00a0sources close to the case have told CNN that the timeline remains very uncertain. Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee had initially allowed proceedings in his courtroom to continue as the appeals court weighed an appeal of his decision to allow Willis to remain on the case. A spokesperson for Willis\u2019 office said they can\u2019t comment on the appeals court\u2019s order at this point. The DA can ask the appeals court to fast track a decision in this matter if it chooses. The appeals court\u2019s decision underscores Trump\u2019s series of successes in his long-running strategy to put prosecutors on the defensive, attack them in the public sphere and challenge them in court. Trump and some of his co-defendants in the sprawling racketeering case have been trying to get Willis disqualified from the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help handle the case. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair. In March, after what amounted to a mini-trial where attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants sought to prove their case against Willis and Wade, McAfee found there was not enough evidence to firmly prove Willis financially benefited from the relationship. Willis\u2019 testimony in televised proceedings put her personal life in the spotlight, turning discussion away from the charges Trump and others face in Georgia. The judge ultimately decided Willis would be allowed to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did. Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead defense counsel in Georgia, said the ruling was proper. \u201cThe Georgia Court of Appeals has properly stayed all proceedings against President Trump in the trial court pending its decision on our interlocutory appeal which argues the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct,\u201d Sadow said in a statement. Speaking briefly to pool reporters Wednesday night, Trump was asked if he\u2019d lost confidence in his legal team after the guilty verdict in his criminal\u00a0hush money trial\u00a0in New York. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a rigged system and it\u2019s a terrible system actually,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing very well. We had a big thing happen in Georgia today,\u201d the former president said. Florida delays help Trump as well Meanwhile, in Trump\u2019s classified documents case in Florida, the federal judge overseeing those proceedings has shown propensity to devote large amounts of in-court time to Trump\u2019s requests to question investigators and his prosecutors\u2019 authority. That judge, Aileen Cannon, indicated on Wednesday she still appears to be willing to hold a hearing where Trump could attempt to put federal investigators under oath so his attorneys could question them, and said she\u2019ll dedicate a day and a half this month to hearing arguments about the legality of his prosecutor. Like the Georgia case, the Florida documents case has no set trial date.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_alito-former-neighbor-flags-cnntv", "text": "A former neighbor of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0disputed\u00a0his account of a neighborhood spat\u00a0that led to the hoisting of an upside-down US flag on his property in Virginia, saying that his timeline of what happened is wrong. \u201cAt best, he\u2019s mistaken, but at worst, he\u2019s just outright lying,\u201d Emily Baden told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett\u00a0on \u201cOutFront\u201d\u00a0in her first television interview since the flag incident\u00a0made national headlines. \u201cEven if it were a valid excuse that they were having a dispute with a neighbor and that made them put the flag up, that timeline just disproves it. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Baden has emerged as a central figure in the evolving story of two provocative flags seen at Alito\u2019s properties, an upside-down US flag hoisted at his home in Virginia in early 2021 and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his New Jersey home last summer. Alito has said the flag in Virginia was a response to a \u201cvery nasty neighborhood dispute,\u201d that apparently involved Baden. Alito has said that his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, hoisted the flag in response to an exchange with Baden in which she at one point used the term \u201cc*nt.\u201d But Baden said that exchange didn\u2019t happen until mid-February. The story came to light when the\u00a0New York Times published\u00a0a photo in May of the inverted American flag flying weeks earlier, on January 17, 2021. Records obtained by CNN show that Baden\u2019s then-boyfriend called police on February 15, 2021, to complain about Martha-Ann Alito, accusing her of \u201cunprompted\u201d harassment. The caller said they believed the confrontations were based on yard signs they had put up that were critical of former President\u00a0Donald Trump. Baden, who no longer lives in the neighborhood, described the exchange with the Alitos in sharp detail\u00a0Wednesday. She said that Justice Alito \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything\u201d as she exchanged words with his wife. \u201cHe just kept walking,\u201d Baden said. \u201cAnd basically disappeared.\u201d Baden said she regrets using the profanity\u00a0if it \u201cdistracts from that real message.\u201d One of the signs that Baden put on the lawn read, \u201cYou are complicit.\u201d Alito has claimed that some of the neighborhood signs were directed at his wife. Baden told CNN\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that the sign was not directed at either of the Alitos. The New York Times subsequently published a photograph of the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at the\u00a0couple\u2019s\u00a0New Jersey property. The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for Trump supporters. Both the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag and inverted US flags were seen at the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The incidents have drawn mounting criticism from Democratic and some Republican lawmakers. Several Democrats have called on Alito to recuse from cases involving the attack on the Capitol. In an unusual response late last month, Alito told lawmakers he had\u00a0nothing to do with the flags and that they were not intended to convey support for Trump or the Capitol attack. Explicitly declining to recuse, Alito said the decisions to hoist the flags were made by his wife. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d The Supreme Court is weighing major cases tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/alito-former-neighbor-flags-cnntv/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_byron-donalds-black-family-jim-crow", "text": "Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican who is seen as a potential running mate for Donald Trump, is defending himself amid Democratic criticism of comments he\u2019d made Tuesday suggesting that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Donalds\u2019 comments,\u00a0which come as Trump\u2019s campaign seeks to make inroads with non-White voters,\u00a0were made at\u00a0an event in Philadelphia with\u00a0Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, another Black Republican supporter of the former president. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said at the Tuesday event, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. \u201cDuring Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative \u2014 because Black people have always been conservative-minded \u2014 but more Black people voted conservatively,\u201d he said. That ended, he suggested, due to a culture of dependence promoted by the federal government\u2019s welfare system in the 1950s, including the establishment of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare \u2014 the federal agency now known as the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 and civil rights efforts that followed under President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. \u201cAnd then HEW, Lyndon Johnson \u2014 you go down that road, and now we are where we are,\u201d Donalds said. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on \u201cNewsNight\u201d on Wednesday evening, Donalds acknowledged that Black Americans are better off today than they were during the Jim Crow era, and\u00a0he\u00a0doubled down on his argument that Black marriage rates were higher prior to the enactment of several social welfare programs during the Johnson\u00a0administration. \u201cAll I was doing is referring to the time periods when you talk about the historical timelines in America and coinciding with Black families and what their marriage rate in\u00a0Black families are,\u201d Donalds said. \u201cNobody ever made nostalgia, that was never the point. It wasn\u2019t even about that,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t even insinuate that.\u201d Donalds\u2019 comments drew harsh rebukes Wednesday from President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, which said on X, \u201cTrump VP contender Byron Donalds claims life was better for Black Americans during Jim Crow,\u201d as well as from other Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took to the House floor at the conclusion of votes to call out Donalds. \u201cThat\u2019s an outlandish, outrageous and out-of-pocket observation,\u201d\u00a0the New York Democrat\u00a0said Wednesday. \u201cWe were not better off when a young boy named Emmett Till could be brutally murdered without consequence because of Jim Crow. We were not better off when Black women could be sexually assaulted without consequence because of Jim Crow.\u201d He added: \u201cHow dare you make such an ignorant observation? You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\u201d Rep. Steven Horsford, the Nevada Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement that Donalds\u2019 comments reflect \u201ca pattern of embracing racist ideologies that we see time and again within the MAGA Republican Party.\u201d \u201cRep. Donalds is playing his role as the mouthpiece who will say the quiet parts out loud that many will not say themselves,\u201d Horsford said. Donalds also responded in a video posted on X Wednesday, saying that Biden\u2019s campaign and Jeffries should \u201ccheck your sources and stop lying to the American people.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re\u00a0trying to say that I said Black people were doing better under Jim Crow. I never said that. They are lying,\u201d Donalds said. \u201cWhat I said was is that you had more Black families under Jim Crow, and it was the Democrat polices under H.E.W., under the welfare state, that did help to destroy the Black family. That\u2019s what I said,\u201d he said. \u201cI also said that you\u2019re seeing a reinvigoration of Black families\u00a0today\u00a0in America, and that is a good thing.\u201d CNN reported Wednesday that Donalds, among others, has been sent various levels of paperwork in the vetting process to be Trump\u2019s running mate, according to two sources familiar with the process. The controversy over the congressman\u2019s remarks comes as\u00a0polls show Trump making gains with Black and Hispanic voters compared to his performance in the 2020 election. Though Philadelphia, where Donalds\u2019 comments occurred, is overwhelmingly Democratic, Pennsylvania is poised to once again serve as one of the most important swing states in November\u2019s election. The Biden campaign seized on Donalds\u2019 Philadelphia remarks to attack Trump and his attempts to reach Black voters. \u201cFrom touting his mugshot to hawking fake sneakers, Trump and his campaign have shown Black Americans how little they think of us \u2013 Black voters are about to show Trump how little they think of him, his allies, and his racist agenda this November,\u201d campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_turnout-2024-election-analysis", "text": "For decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024. A wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote. These new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_austin-cnn-interview", "text": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0told CNN\u00a0Thursday he believed the new policy allowing the Ukrainian military\u00a0to carry out limited strikes inside Russia with US munitions\u00a0will\u00a0be \u201cvery, very helpful to the Ukrainians going forward.\u201d \u201c[W]hat we have done is provided Ukraine the ability to counter fire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they\u2019re firing at the Ukrainians,\u201d Austin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer\u00a0on\u00a0\u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Austin spoke with CNN from Normandy, France, where he has joined other world leaders for the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day, including President Joe Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, and more than 20 other heads of state including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Austin\u2019s comments came days after Biden\u00a0gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russian territory \u2014 though limiting it to targets close to the border of Kharkiv\u00a0where Russian forces have been concentrating their efforts \u2014 with US munitions. Asked about waning support in the US, Austin said he believed there has been \u201cstrong support for Ukraine\u201d among both political parties, despite how long it took for Congress to pass its security aid package for the embattled country\u00a0and emphasized that\u00a0Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin likely won\u2019t stop at Ukraine. \u201cI was confident that the right thing was going to happen, because anytime you see that type of support on both sides of the aisle for a cause, Congress will find a way to get things done. Which is what they did in this case, because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ukraine matters \u2026 not just for Ukraine\u2019s purposes alone, not for Europe alone \u2014\u00a0it matters for to us and it matters to the entire globe.\u00a0So, we have to make sure that Putin doesn\u2019t have the ability to trample Ukraine because as the president said there\u2019s a good chance, almost certain, that Putin won\u2019t stop there. He will continue to move forward in other acts of aggression.\u201d On Thursday, Biden gave a blistering critique of Putin, telling ABC News\u2019 David Muir that Putin is \u201cnot a decent man, he\u2019s a dictator.\u201d Standing in the Normandy American Cemetery, Austin told CNN he believed the \u201cnumber of leaders who lean towards autocracy\u201d around the globe pose the greatest threat to the US, and that the sacrifice so many gave to \u201censure our freedom\u201d should never be forgotten. \u201c[I]t\u2019s those sacrifices that really gave birth to the rules-based international order that served us so well for so many years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to protect that \u2014\u00a0we have to work hard to protect it. Democracy is worth having, but it\u2019s something that you have to work on, you have to fight for.\u201d \u2018Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people\u2019 Austin declined on Thursday to comment on an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza on a UN-run school that was housing displaced people, which killed at least 45 people, saying he would \u201cleave it to Israel to talk about what happened in that strike.\u201d He emphasized though that Israel must take more actions to avoid civilian casualties, and that accomplishing their military objectives and protecting civilians should not be mutually exclusive. \u201cI think the way you ensure long-term success is by making sure that you take the civilian population, eventually strip them away from Hamas, and demonstrate that Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people,\u201d Austin said. Asked if he believes Israel has committed war crimes in its operations against Hamas in Gaza, Austin echoed Biden\u2019s comments that it is \u201cuncertain\u201d and should be investigated, which he said Israel would be doing. \u201cThis is a professional force,\u201d he said, \u201cand we would expect they do the kinds of things that professional forces do, you know, make sure they\u2019re doing the right things to employ the weapons appropriately, and also if there are problems, investigate those problems and learn from that.\u201d So far, Austin said, the US has still not seen Israel begin a \u201cmajor movement into Rafah.\u201d US and China must \u2018continue to have a dialogue\u2019 Austin also spoke briefly on Thursday about challenges in the Indo-Pacific and his recent meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Adm. Dong Jun, in Singapore. He reiterated that it is important for the US and China to \u201ccontinue to have a dialogue\u201d and that he voiced concerns over what is happening in the region. Just two weeks ago, China launched military drills encircling Taiwan after the democratic island swore in a new president. \u201cI voiced my concerns about some of the things that we\u2019ve seen in the region, and we\u2019ll continue to do so going forward,\u201d Austin said. \u201cBut unless you\u2019re talking to each other, you don\u2019t have the ability to prevent miscalculations and address misperceptions. So I think this is a good first step, but there\u2019s a lot more that needs to be done in terms of engaging and in terms of moving things in the right direction.\u201d This story has been updated with\u00a0additional\u00a0details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/austin-cnn-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to call out his predecessor Donald Trump as a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d for the first time represents a significant hardening of his rhetoric against his Republican general election foe. Biden\u2019s escalation at an off-camera fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday evening came as some Democrats pressed for a more robust political attack on the presumptive Republican nominee following his guilty verdict in his New York hush money trial last week. \u201cFor the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\u201d Other Democratic officials have used such rhetoric. But the phrase took on greater force coming from the mouth of the president himself. While Republicans have rallied around Trump since his conviction, it remains unclear how the verdict will go down in swing states where the shift in a few thousand votes could decide November\u2019s election. Biden\u2019s remark was yet another stunning turn in an election entangled in Trump\u2019s multiple legal threats. It came on a day when the first family was embroiled in its own extraordinary courtroom drama as Biden\u2019s son Hunter became the first child of a sitting president to go on trial. The younger Biden has pleaded not guilty to charges of buying and possessing a gun illegally while addicted to or abusing drugs. He also faces a tax trial in September. Last week, Biden noted that Trump had been convicted on 34 felony counts and said it was \u201creckless \u2026 dangerous \u2026 and irresponsible\u201d for his opponent to say the verdict was rigged. Presidential remarks in off-camera fundraisers can often serve as a test bed for rhetoric that later emerges in public events. But Biden\u2019s sharpened tone will certainly lead to accusations by the Trump campaign that the former president\u2019s conviction came after a process of political weaponization of the justice system. In another significant legal development Monday, Trump got good news from Georgia, where he is among multiple defendants in a racketeering case over his attempt to steal the swing state from Biden\u2019s column in the 2020 election. The Georgia Court of Appeals set oral arguments for October 4 over an effort to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. It was just the latest blow to prosecutors pursuing Trump over his election interference case. The timing of the arguments \u2014 only a month before Election Day \u2014 makes for an impossibly short timeframe for a trial. The Georgia case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been delayed by defendants\u2019 attempt to disqualify Willis after she employed a prosecutor with whom she was in a relationship. Other Trump cases are in suspended animation Two federal cases against Trump, in which he\u2019s also pleaded not guilty, are in a holding pattern. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on Trump\u2019s sweeping demand for immunity for actions he undertook while president. The justices could still deliver a definitive ruling, but any decision that requires further litigation in lower courts could mean time runs out in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case with only five months to go before Election Day. At the same time, multiple disputes in pre-trial motions have put the looming federal trial in Florida over Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents into suspended animation. Democrats have accused Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon of showing political bias in her rulings. The logjam on multiple fronts means that it may prove impossible for the US legal system to account for the alleged attempt by a former president to stay in power against the will of voters before he has the chance to win another mandate. In itself, the delay represents a significant threat to American democracy\u2019s bid to save itself since it suggests that a future president who acted the same way Trump did might expect impunity. Trump\u2019s avoidance of accountability over 2020 election interference \u2014 through a mixture of skilled litigation by his lawyers, some backfiring decisions by prosecutors and luck \u2014 would also hugely raise the stakes of November\u2019s election. If Trump loses, his future after already losing one criminal case looks incredibly grim, with three cases that are likely to eventually get to trials that will entail massive legal fees. But if Trump wins, he could appoint an attorney general who could halt the federal cases in their tracks. And his Justice Department would be sure to make every effort to delay or defray any negative outcome he faces in the Georgia case as well as the New York hush money conviction that is due to proceed to sentencing on July 11. Given the personal stakes, it\u2019s reasonable to assume Trump will not stop at anything to regain power at a time when he\u2019s refusing to guarantee accepting the result of the 2024 election. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House counsel, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday that the date set in Georgia in October means there is \u201cno possibility of this case going to trial before the election.\u201d\u00a0And he added that the chances were rising that Trump could avoid any legal accountability for his actions in 2020 if he wins in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s very real if he wins the election, it\u2019s not real at all if he loses,\u201d Cobb said. Referring to the federal election interference case and the classified documents matter, Cobb said, \u201cBoth of those will end up going at some point if Trump loses in early to mid next year and the Georgia case will likely follow that along.\u201d History made in Delaware The sluggish pace of Trump\u2019s criminal trials contrasts with the efficiency of those facing Hunter Biden, who\u2019s also due to face trial on tax charges in September. The cases of the former president and the current president\u2019s son are not analogous, and those surrounding Trump are hugely complicated. But they are sure to leave many Democrats marveling at the prospect that the only federal trial entangled with this year\u2019s election could be one that is targeting Hunter Biden and not Trump, whose actions after the 2020 election stretched US democracy to its limit. Joe Biden pledged on Monday not to comment on the outcome of a federal trial, but in a statement, he expressed boundless love for his son and his respect for his success in overcoming addiction to crack cocaine. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a dad,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s cranked up rhetoric at the Monday fundraiser follows a warning by Trump in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday of the consequences if Judge Juan Merchan imposed any jail term following the guilty verdict last week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the public would stand for it,\u201d the former president said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there\u2019s a breaking point.\u201d Some senior Democrats accused Trump of inciting violence in his remarks, which took on a more ominous complexion given his past invocation to supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \u201cThis is clearly Donald Trump once again inciting violence, potential violence, when he is sentenced,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff told Kasie Hunt on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\u00a0 The California Democrat accused Trump of issuing \u201cyet another dangerous appeal to violence.\u201d The extraordinary tangling of the 2024 election and legal cases weighing on both Trump and Biden is likely to dominate a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday when Attorney General Merrick Garland will brave a new grilling by Republicans. Garland vowed to restore trust in the legal system when he took office following the tumultuous Trump years by making sure everyone plays by the same rules. Three years on, he\u2019s frustrated much of Washington with a quest that looks quaint in an era when judges, prosecutors and juries in a proliferating wave of politically loaded cases are under almost constant attack. But hostility toward Garland has not come just from Republicans, who will be looking for vengeance on Tuesday following Trump\u2019s conviction. Democrats fret over the slow pace of the federal investigations. And the White House complained to Garland after special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report on Joe Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents portrayed the president\u2019s memory as significantly degraded in a report that unleashed weeks of political reverberations, CNN reported. Garland is also likely to face scrutiny over the Hunter Biden trial. House Republicans have seized on the case to try to damage the president politically, especially after failing to provide any evidence that he profited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in their misfiring impeachment investigation. Republicans celebrated when a plea deal, which they saw as \u201csweetheart\u201d treatment for Hunter Biden, collapsed in court. But the Hunter Biden trial, as well as a federal corruption trial targeting New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, undercuts Republican claims of a biased justice system made in the wake of the Trump verdict in New York last week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_us-ambassador-to-nato-top-state-department-role", "text": "President Joe Biden has nominated\ufeff the current US ambassador to NATO to one of the top positions at the State Department. Biden announced on Wednesday his intent to nominate Julianne Smith to serve as the undersecretary of state for political affairs \u2013 a key diplomatic post involved in US efforts on Ukraine and the Middle East. Her nomination was sent to the Senate the same day, according to a release from the White House. The role has been without a confirmed official since late March, following the departure of Victoria Nuland. John Bass, the Under Secretary for Management, has been serving in the role in an acting capacity. Smith took on the role of US\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to NATO in November 2021, previously serving as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. She has been the top US envoy to NATO throughout Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war has put the defensive alliance to the test and prompted its expansion, with Finland and Sweden both joining NATO in response to Russia\u2019s invasion. A US official said that the administration hopes Smith will be confirmed to the job as soon as possible. It is unclear how quickly the Senate will move her nomination forward. A group of Republican senators have vowed to block all nominees in response to former President Donald Trump\u2019s guilty verdict in the New York hush money case.. \u201cWe would urge those who wish to see our ambassador nominees confirmed quickly to weigh in with those senators who have said they\u2019re going to block them,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is responsible for the outset of the confirmation process, \u201cis strongly supportive and enthusiastic about the announcement of her nomination,\u201d said Eric Harris, the communications director for SFRC Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely looking forward to advancing her through the confirmation process ASAP.\u201d Smith will remain in the role of US\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to NATO while she awaits confirmation, meaning she will likely still have the role during next month\u2019s NATO summit in Washington, DC. Blinken said following an informal NATO meeting in Prague last week that the Washington Summit would celebrate the alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary but also \u201con the steps we\u2019re taking to ensure that the Alliance is fit for purpose for the next 75 years to meet the challenges of today and challenges we anticipate tomorrow.\u201d \u201cAt the summit, we\u2019ll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there\u2019s a bridge to membership, a bridge that\u2019s strong and well-lit,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO will help build Ukraine\u2019s future force, one that can effectively deter aggression and defend against it if necessary.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/us-ambassador-to-nato-top-state-department-role/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fascism-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "This week, Americans and Europeans celebrated the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces invaded occupied France, marking the beginning of the end of fascist power in Europe. Last week, after being found guilty of falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump said Americans today live in a \u201cfascist state,\u201d building on his unfounded conspiracy theory that somehow President Joe Biden is behind his prosecution in Manhattan. It was an ironic turn of phrase for Trump since, throughout his rise, academics and pundits have debated whether his cult-of-personality politics veers toward a form of fascism. But flipping the script on his critics is a specialty of the former president. Robert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University who has written widely on fascism in Europe, had rejected the label for Trump until January 6, 2021, when the historian argued that the image of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol \u201cremoves my objection to the fascist label.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of certain terms has forced comparisons The debate over whether Trump veers toward fascism was renewed multiple times this year after Trump\u2019s committed followers swatted away a field of qualified challengers for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has repeatedly used language that can be tied back to Nazis, such as when he said immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country. Last month, his campaign amplified and then deleted a supporter\u2019s video that promised a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins reelection. The New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat took a close look at all of the images presented in that video and concluded for CNN Opinion that the video was \u201creminiscent of the fascist propaganda I have studied for\u00a0many years.\u201d With a charismatic leader, a nationalist outlook built around fear of immigrants and a sense of grievance built around his 2020 election loss, there are certainly some ingredients of fascism in the current version of Trump\u2019s campaign. Supporters have a plan to use a second Trump term to gut portions of the civil service, supposedly to remake a government that will more easily bend to his will. His sense of persecution at facing criminal charges adds more grist. Trump has consistently teased the idea that he will repay his political rival, Biden, for his conviction. The Trump-supporting Fox News host Sean Hannity tried repeatedly on Wednesday to get Trump to rule out using the Department of Justice as an arm for vengeance, but Trump rambled around the questions. \u201cIt has to stop, because otherwise we\u2019re not going to have a country,\u201d Trump said, suggesting he would not weaponize the Justice Department. But he then said he would be fully within his rights to prosecute his political opponents.  \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president said. That\u2019s less definitive than the social media post last year when Trump verifiably promised, if he wins, to appoint a special counsel to \u201cgo after\u201d Biden, but it\u2019s certainly not a hard no. \u2018I don\u2019t care what you call this\u2019 When CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance about Trump\u2019s claim the US is a \u201cfascist state,\u201d Vance, who CNN has reported is being vetted as a potential Trump running mate, would not reject the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love,\u201d Vance said in a tense exchange. Watch it: A warning from McConnell There are comparisons between current times and the rise of fascism everywhere at the moment, even when they are not focused directly on Trump. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times commemorating D-Day titled, \u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the 1930s.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mention Trump. McConnell will step aside from his Senate GOP leadership position in November in part because his party has moved away from the arsenal-of-democracy view of American power embraced by McConnell and other old-school Republicans and toward an isolationist, Vladimir Putin-friendly view of foreign policy pushed by Trump. Arguing that we rightly celebrate D-Day soldiers, McConnell argued we often forget why those service members needed to fight in the first place. \u201cWe forget how influential isolationists persuaded millions of Americans that the fate of allies and partners mattered little to our own security and prosperity,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe gloss over the powerful political forces that downplayed growing danger, resisted providing assistance to allies and partners, and tried to limit America\u2019s ability to defend its national interests.\u201d I talked to Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and editor of the new book, \u201cDid It Happen Here? Perspectives on Fascism and America,\u201d which includes the writing of Paxton, among many others. \u201cThat model of historical comparison where we look to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and then use it as kind of a navigational device or a map for understanding what\u2019s happened today is quite common,\u201d he said, although there are arguments it is a flawed comparison. \u201cConcepts don\u2019t have timeless essences that we can just map on to any phenomena, but they change given political context, given power structures in society,\u201d he said. Today, he said, the term \u201cfascism\u201d is used \u201cto mobilize people in order to get over their divides, to defeat an enemy that\u2019s far greater than their own long-standing disputes.\u201d Steinmetz-Jenkins argued there is a long history, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, of Americans on both sides of the political aisle trying to label their opponents as \u201cfascist,\u201d and there are also examples of American lawmakers threatening their opponents with investigation. There are arguments in favor of the fascism comparison, but also arguments against it \u2013 particularly since there are echoes of Trump\u2019s rise in populist and White nationalist movements closer to home in American history. Directly comparing eras can backfire For instance, Rep. Byron Donalds, a Black Republican from Florida and another potential Trump running mate, has had to explain his argument that American social programs have driven Black families apart and that they were more cohesive at a time of legalized racial terror under Jim Crow laws in the US, which were a model for Nazis. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said in comments first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer. He tried to explain that comment to CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on Wednesday, arguing he was not expressing nostalgia for the Jim Crow era, but rather trying to argue that during that period, marriage rates were higher. It was a complicated argument for him to make, to say the least. Donalds tried to argue that the ideological divide in today\u2019s political parties should be applied to perceptions of that era, when some Southern Democrats opposed civil rights legislation and some Northern Republicans supported it. Today, the parties are even more regionally divided, with Democrats largely out of power in the South and Republicans largely out of power in the North. The parties realigned around conservative and liberal ideologies \u2013 a process that continues to happen today as Republicans reorient around Trumpism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fascism-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_house-gop-criminal-referrals-doj-hunter-james-biden", "text": "The Republican-led committees leading an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden on Wednesday referred the president\u2019s son and brother to the Department of Justice, recommending they be charged with making false statements to Congress during their respective closed-door interviews earlier this year. The Republican committee chairmen laid out their case for why the DOJ should pursue criminal charges of Hunter and James Biden in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel David Weiss, who is leading separate criminal cases involving Hunter Biden. Through the criminal referrals, House Republicans are looking to go on offense, even if they don\u2019t move the needle in their stalled impeachment inquiry into the president. That investigation has failed to uncover evidence of wrongdoing by Biden and Republicans lack the votes in their narrow majority to impeach him. A referral, however, by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case and serves as a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. As such, the letter from House Oversight Chair James Comer, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith is largely symbolic at present. The Justice Department confirmed Wednesday that it had received the referrals, which cite two false statements the lawmakers say Hunter Biden made during his February 28 deposition and one false statement they say James Biden made during his February 21 interview with congressional investigators based on documents Republicans voted to release from IRS whistleblowers last month. The department declined additional comment. The Republicans are seeking to tie their criminal referral of Hunter Biden to his ongoing criminal trial on felony gun charges, arguing the criminal charge of lying on a gun purchase that he faces should weigh on how the DOJ evaluates their accusations. \u201cAccording to the Justice Manual, DOJ should consider Hunter Biden\u2019s prior alleged criminal activity when evaluating whether to charge him for the false statements described below,\u201d the letter states. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement Wednesday that the referral \u201cis nothing more than a desperate attempt by Republicans to twist Hunter\u2019s testimony so they can distract from their failed impeachment inquiry and interfere with his trial.\u201d CNN has reached out to representatives for James Biden. Republicans allege Hunter Biden \u201cfalsely distanced himself\u201d from his involvement with a corporate entity that received millions of dollars from foreign individuals, Rosemont Seneca Bohai. They also claim he testified an \u201centirely fictitious account\u201d about alleged text messages where he used his father as leverage to pressure a Chinese company into paying him. The president has emphatically denied\u00a0that he was involved or present\u00a0when his son sent the text messages. Hunter Biden also testified he was \u201cdrunk and probably high\u201d when he sent the messages, and his father was not sitting next to him. On James Biden, Republicans say his testimony that Joe Biden, as a private citizen, did not meet with Biden family business associate Tony Bobulinski, has been contradicted by Bobulinski and Hunter Biden. House Speaker Mike Johnson called on the DOJ to act immediately. \u201cIf the Attorney General wishes to demonstrate he is not running a two-tiered system of justice and targeting the President\u2019s political opponents, he will open criminal investigations into James and Hunter Biden,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. In a statement accompanying the criminal referrals, Comer said, \u201cWe\u2019ve caught President Biden\u2019s son and brother making blatant lies to Congress in what appears to be a concerted effort to hide Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in his family\u2019s schemes.\u201d Jordan echoed: \u201cThese criminal referrals are a reflection of criminal wrongdoing by the Biden family, and the Department of Justice must take steps to hold the Bidens accountable.\u201d Smith, whose committee produced the documents that Republicans are using to allege the men made false statements, said that \u201cthe IRS whistleblowers have provided indisputable evidence that Hunter Biden broke the law and lied to Congress during his February deposition.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, blasted the criminal referrals on Wednesday, saying they illustrate the \u201cspectacular failure and collapse\u201d of the Republican-led impeachment inquiry into the president. \u201cThe Chairmen\u2019s 60-page letter is a last-ditch effort to distract from the exoneration of President Biden by offering \u2018gotcha\u2019 accusations against the President\u2019s son and brother based on their efforts to recollect years-old financial transactions, text messages, and conversations in the course of this interminable fishing expedition,\u201d Raskin said.
