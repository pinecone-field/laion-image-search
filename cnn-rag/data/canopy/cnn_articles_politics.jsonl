Although the vice president has been a loyal messenger for President Joe Biden\u2019s platform for the past four years, she has previously advocated for more progressive positions on health care, taxes and other issues and will have to decide whether she\u2019ll return to those roots. A look at the proposals she floated during her run for the 2020 presidential nomination \u2013 in which Biden staked out more moderate ground \u2013 and as a senator can give some insights into her potential platform for 2024. Broadening health insurance coverage Harris advocated for shifting the US to a government-backed health insurance system but stopped short of wanting to completely eliminate private insurance during her 2020 campaign. The proposal was to the left of the one floated by Biden, who wanted to build on the Affordable Care Act, but not as progressive as Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-All plan, which she co-sponsored while in the Senate. Both of her rivals critiqued her idea, with Biden\u2019s campaign calling it a \u201chave-it-every-which-way approach.\u201d Harris\u2019 measure called for transitioning to a Medicare-for-All-type system over 10 years but continuing to allow private insurance companies to offer Medicare plans. Also, the proposal would not have raised taxes on the middle class to pay for the coverage expansion, in another contrast with Sanders\u2019 plan. Instead, it would raise the needed funds by taxing Wall Street trades and transactions and changing the taxation of offshore corporate income. The Biden administration, along with congressional Democrats, broadened access to health insurance by temporarily beefing up the federal premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act policies. That helped drive the uninsured rate to record lows during his term. But the enhanced subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, so the next president and Congress will have to decide how to handle an extension, which could cost about $335 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Defending abortion rights Harris\u00a0took on the lead role\u00a0of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. In January, she started a \u201creproductive freedoms tour\u201d to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an\u00a0abortion clinic. On abortion access too, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate\u00a0criticizing\u00a0his previous support for the\u00a0Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions. Policy experts suggested that although Harris\u2019 current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden\u2019s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on\u00a0maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger. \u201cOne of the roles of the White House in abortion policy is the power of the bully pulpit,\u201d said\u00a0Kelly Baden, vice president of public policy for the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights. \u201cSo to have somebody who feels comfortable and really values-aligned with a strong message about abortion justice, that is potentially a shift in what we would see with a Harris administration versus a Biden administration.\u201d Baden also said Harris\u2019 conversations with abortion patients and providers, as well as state legislators and others, through her tour this year give her \u201ca deeper well from which to draw when it comes to what is needed on abortion policy in the world now.\u201d And, she concluded, Harris may place the issue higher on her list of priorities. Providing middle class tax relief As a senator, Harris proposed providing middle-class and working families with a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year (per couple) to help keep up with living expenses. The measure would have cost an estimated $3 trillion over 10 years. Unlike a typical tax credit, the bill would allow taxpayers to receive the benefit \u2013 up to $500 \u2013 on a monthly basis so families don\u2019t have to turn to payday loans with very high interest rates. Harris also campaigned on the measure \u2013 titled the LIFT the Middle Class Act, or Livable Incomes for Families Today \u2013 during her earlier presidential run. Many American families are now struggling to afford the even higher costs of living after a spell of steep inflation earlier this decade pushed up prices, which remain elevated. They generally give the Biden administration poor marks for its handling of the economy, which campaign officials have had trouble changing despite repeated efforts to show how the president has tried to lower costs and help everyday people. One popular measure \u2013 an expanded child tax credit that gave certain families up to $3,600 per child that was partially available in monthly payments \u2013 was only in effect in 2021. As a presidential candidate, Harris also proposed raising the corporate income tax rate to 35%, where it was before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through Congress reduced the rate to 21%. Biden has floated increasing the rate to 28%. Although Harris will probably pursue similar policies on raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations to provide relief for middle-class and working Americans, she may alter them somewhat. \u201cI would expect Harris to put her own stamp on these ideas much like she proposed in her 2019 \u2018LIFT the Middle Class Act,\u2019\u201d John Gimigliano, a principal at KPMG\u2019s Washington National Tax practice, said in a statement, adding that an important factor will be whom Harris chooses as Treasury secretary, should she win the election. Lowering drug prices Harris has had many ideas on how to reduce drug costs, a main health care headache for Americans and a popular talking point for many presidential candidates, including Biden and Trump. Titled People over Profit, Harris\u2019 plan had similar provisions to legislation rolled out by Sanders, and some of the concepts made it into the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats pushed through Congress in 2022, such as penalizing drugmakers that raise their prices faster than inflation. Like Trump, Harris proposed allowing the federal government to set \u201ca fair price\u201d for any drug sold at a cheaper price in any economically comparable country, including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan or Australia. If manufacturers were found to be price gouging, the government could import their drugs from abroad or, in egregious cases, use its existing but never-used \u201cmarch-in\u201d authority to license a drug company\u2019s patent to a rival that would produce the medication at a lower cost. As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris joined other states in pursuing several drugmakers for their pricing or practices, winning multimillion-dollar settlements. Boosting affordable housing As a senator, Harris introduced the Rent Relief Act, which would establish a refundable tax credit for renters who annually spend more than 30% of their gross income on rent and utilities. The amount of the credit would range from 25% to 100% of the excess rent, depending on the renter\u2019s income. Harris called housing a human right and said in a 2019 news release on the bill that every American deserves to have basic security and dignity in their own home. The Biden administration has been increasingly focused on helping people with high housing costs. Earlier this month, Biden released a series of proposals that included pulling tax credits from landlords who raise rent by more than 5% per year and having federal agencies assess whether to use surplus federally owned land to build affordable housing. Earlier in the year, he proposed a mortgage relief credit that would provide $5,000 per year for two years for middle-class first-time homebuyers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/harris-abortion-health-care-economic-policies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress", "text": "US and Israeli officials are voicing increased optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire and hostage deal being agreed to end the war in Gaza as the loved ones of hostages being held by Hamas say that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must take the deal on offer. Efforts to secure an agreement have been ongoing for months and picked up renewed momentum in late May after US President Joe Biden laid out the details of a plan to bring home the hostages and eventually bring about an end to the war. Now, as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to deliver a high-stakes speech to Congress on Wednesday\u00a0and meet with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, US officials claim a final deal is within reach. For the families of the hostages held more than nine months in Gaza, there is no time to wait. On Monday, Biden said he believed the different parties were on the \u201cverge of being able to\u201d secure a deal to bring home the hostages and end the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that they are\u00a0\u201cinside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability.\u201d US officials insist that Israel and Hamas have both agreed to the broad framework of a deal, but specifics and crucial technicalities need to be hammered out. Mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been leading efforts to finalize those details. A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Tuesday that an Israeli delegation that was expected to leave on Thursday to transmit the latest Israeli response to the mediators is likely to delay its trip until at least Friday as a result of Netanyahu\u2019s meeting with Biden being postponed until Thursday afternoon. The Israeli prime minister wants to meet with Biden before the Israeli delegation formally transmits its response to the mediators, the source said. The Israeli response is expected to include Netanyahu\u2019s eleventh-hour demands regarding barring armed men from northern Gaza and Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor \u2013 key sticking points in the negotiations. If Hamas agrees to those demands, a deal is likely to follow. \u201cIf Hamas will say yes, there will be a deal,\u201d the source said. The latest Israeli response will also coincide with the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, going into recess next week. That will make it harder for any right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government. US officials have been sensitive to the Knesset recess as they remain convinced that politics are at play for Netanyahu back in Israel. Still, as Israel prepares to transmit its response, it has become increasingly clear to multiple parties involved that clinching a ceasefire now depends on the Israeli prime minister and his government. \u201cIt\u2019s really Israel\u2019s decision,\u201d an official familiar with the talks told CNN. There\u2019s real\u00a0concern\u00a0among the families of Israeli hostages as to whether Netanyahu is willing to make a deal to end the brutal war, after numerous false dawns suggesting a ceasefire was close. Netanyahu \u2018has to take it\u2019 Aviva Siegel, a former hostage whose husband, Keith, is still a hostage, told CNN Tuesday that Netanyahu \u201chas to take it and not continue the war.\u201d \u201cHe needs to stop the war for kids to come home and the hostages to come home. They are much more important than continuing the war. They\u2019ve suffered. I\u2019ve been there. I know what the situation is. I know what they\u2019re going through,\u201d said Siegel, who was freed after 51 days in Hamas captivity. There are believed to be 116 people who were abducted during the October 7 Hamas attack remaining in Gaza \u2013 44 of them are believed to be deceased. The families said ahead of\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s\u00a0address\u00a0to Congress\u00a0that they expect to hear the Israeli prime minister tell Congress that he has agreed to a deal \u2013 anything less, they said, is a failure. The families praised Biden\u2019s leadership on the efforts to bring their loved one\u2019s home but now that the US president has announced he will not seek reelection, they are urging him to ratchet up the pressure to finish the deal \u2013 something they say could be a key part of his legacy. The families are expected to meet with Biden and with Netanyahu on Thursday. \u201cNot only should you not all collectively take your foot off the gas but put it on even harder and make sure that part of your legacy, Mr. President, is that you get the credit for saving the lives of as many of these hostages as possible,\u201d said Jon Polin, the father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Indeed, the conflict in the Middle East has been a consuming issue for the US president since the October 7 attack. Whether it comes to an end before Biden\u2019s first term will be consequential for his predecessor \u2013 whether that is Donald Trump, or possibly Harris, whom Biden has endorsed for the Democratic nomination. When Harris meets with Netanyahu at the White House this week, she plans to convey to the Israeli leader that it is time for the war to end, a Harris aide said. Many Israelis, including family members of hostages, are convinced Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want a deal, instead preferring to extend the war and thereby his grip on power. \u201cWe expect from our prime minister to cease all stalling, to cease torpedoing any hope for a negotiated return of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the suffering of the people of Gaza,\u201d said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen. \u201cWe expect to hear him declare that Israel is going to sign this imperfect, imperfect agreement with Satan, meaning Hamas. But it is a national necessity and anything less than that would be a total failure of his leadership.\u201d Netanyahu, who met on Monday in Washington with families of hostages, said his Israeli government is \u201cdetermined to return everyone.\u201d \u201cThe conditions to bring them back are ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We are seeing a certain change, and I think this change will continue to grow,\u201d the Israeli prime minister said. However, Daniel Neutra, whose brother Omer is being held hostage, said that \u201cthe urgency of the matter did not seem to resonate with\u201d Netanyahu at Monday night\u2019s meeting. \u2018Remaining issues\u2019 On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that they \u201chave significantly narrowed the disagreements between the parties,\u201d but there are \u201ca few remaining issues that need to be resolved.\u201d \u201cWe continue discussions with the other mediators, and with the Government of Israel to try to reach resolution, but we don\u2019t have that yet, and I don\u2019t have any kind of forecast about when we might come to one,\u201d Miller said. According to an official from a mediating country, the latest proposal from Hamas earlier this month \u201cwas very close\u201d to the Israeli position from late May so when Hamas responded, it was believed that Israel\u2019s reaction \u201cwould be positive and ready to move forward\u201d with technical teams dispatched to iron out the final details. Negotiators are currently awaiting a response from Israel to a Hamas document received on July 3, according to that official, and recent Israeli responses have been unexpected and unclear, the official said, pointing to Israel\u2019s reneging on a previous, critical position about allowing the unrestricted return of Palestinians to northern Gaza during a pause in the fighting. There\u2019s also significant debate around the Philadelphi corridor and Rafah border crossing, both located between Egypt and Gaza. Netanyahu has argued Israel troops will not withdraw from the nine-mile-long Philadelphi corridor while Hamas has insisted on a full eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza,\u00a0and their response, according to a source familiar, is expected to stick to that demand. A central sticking point has been whether a first pause in the fighting would flow seamlessly into a permanent ceasefire, something Israel has rejected. The Biden framework \u2013 and a UN resolution that followed \u2013 says the first phase will continue as long discussions do over a second phase. That, theoretically, could mean talks could break down and fighting resumes. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in Gaza remains dire and US officials involved in the humanitarian and security efforts have grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli aggression in recent weeks. There remains no effective communication between the Israel Defense Forces and humanitarian groups, and just in the last week a UN convoy was shot at by the IDF. US officials believe it is possible that Israelis are seeking to put maximum pressure on Hamas ahead of a deal. If a first phase of the ceasefire is launched, Hamas is expected to release just over 30 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Biden\u2019s natioanl security advisor Jake\u00a0Sullivan acknowledged on Friday that the exact numbers and type of Palestinian prisoners to be released need to be finalized. There is still discussion around the number of vetoes Israel would have over Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants released, with an expectation that Israel would oppose more hardened prisoners serving longer \u2013 or life \u2013 sentences, according to details provided by the official from a mediating country, who was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. As negotiations on the deal continue, there are also ongoing discussions about security, humanitarian aid, and governance once an agreement is put into place. Those discussions will continue with Netanyahu this week. US and Egyptian officials have begun preparing the flood of humanitarian aid that would enter Gaza if a ceasefire deal goes into effect. Egypt has worked to pre-position nearly 200,000 metric tons of supplies in the northern Egyptian city of el-Arish, one official familiar with the matter said, and talks to prepare for the enormous logistical effort have intensified in the last week. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is an agreement that\u2019s followed by some kind of void that will either be filled, if it\u2019s there, by Hamas coming back, which is unacceptable; by Israel prolonging its occupation, which they say they don\u2019t want to do and is unacceptable; or just having a vacuum that\u2019s filled by lawlessness, that\u2019s filled by chaos, which we see in so many parts of Gaza right now, which is also inimical to actually helping people who desperately need it,\u201d Blinken said Friday. \u201cSo making sure that we have a plan in place, which we\u2019ve been working on also every single day \u2013 with Arab partners, with Israel, with many others for governance, for security, for humanitarian assistance, for reconstruction \u2013 that\u2019s critical.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_election-biden-harris-what-matters", "text": "Another week, another shock to the 2024 presidential election. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris raised a large number of questions. For starters, Biden won the Democratic primary in every state that conducted one. Can he just step aside? Is he picking Harris as his replacement, or do the people get a say? CNN asked for your questions about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve picked out a representative sampling and tried to answer with what we know based on CNN\u2019s reporting and polling. See below. You\u2019re right. Harris is not the nominee and she wasn\u2019t a candidate during the monthslong primary process. However, with Biden out of the race, the delegates he won are free to support any declared candidate recognized by the party at the convention in Chicago in August. Just hours after Biden withdrew from the race, Harris filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to become a candidate for president, which would allow her to  get signatures to be recognized at the convention. An avalanche of Democrats have already endorsed her, so while it is possible another candidate jumps in the ring and challenges her at the convention, at the moment that seems unlikely. Harris has the support of enough Democratic delegates to win the party\u2019s nomination for president, according to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate. Harris crossed the threshold amid a wave of endorsements from state delegations Monday evening. These endorsements are not binding and with Biden out of the race, delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice. There is a process; it\u2019s just currently being dominated by Harris. This is an unprecedented event. Biden is the first president to bow out of a reelection campaign after winning nearly all of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. Since there is no time to repeat the primaries in all 50 states, Democrats are primed to simply select the nominee with delegates to their convention. Biden has released the delegates to support whomever they choose, but Harris may end up being the only major candidate as the party tries to unify around her. Not currently. In order to challenge Harris at the convention, a candidate would have to get the signatures of hundreds of delegates and gain recognition as a candidate from the party. That is possible, but there are no top-tier Democrats currently saying they will challenge Harris. In fact, most of the Democrats who have been discussed as potential future candidates \u2013 people like Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania \u2013 have all endorsed Harris. Interesting idea! Other people submitting questions suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, another disaffected Republican. According to party rules, the process for selecting the vice presidential candidate mirrors the process for selecting the presidential candidate. Presidential candidates must sign a pledge that they are a Democrat and will run as a Democrat. However, it is possible that if Harris wanted to find a willing Republican, that person could quickly register as a Democrat to be on the ticket. Or Democrats could change their rules at the convention. However, it does not appear, at least at the moment, that Harris is considering a former Republican to be on the ticket. We don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve covered too many elections to put too much stock in odds predictions for elections. I will wait to see if there\u2019s any movement in polling in the coming days and weeks. In fact, some organizations that engage in such forecasts have suspended them for the time being. Polling conducted before Biden left the race suggests a tight matchup going forward. In an election featuring former President Donald Trump and Harris, there is no clear leader. Trump has 48% compared with Harris\u2019 47% in CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls, which is an average of the six most recent nonpartisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards. But the election may still come down to who can win the three Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden won in 2020: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Keep an eye on those states. Harris could pick a running mate to appeal to Rust Belt voters. She can help motivate Black voters and women. But her selection may not change the underlying dynamic of a closely divided nation and a few battleground states. Technically, Biden isn\u2019t yet on any ballot. The party has not yet officially selected its nominee; that happens at the Democratic National Convention in August or in a virtual roll call before that. Biden is releasing the delegates pledged to support him, and there\u2019s currently no indication of anyone except Harris stepping forward. The state with a question mark about timing of the DNC, Ohio, already changed its law to allow for Democrats to select a candidate. Plus, there is no guarantee that a state\u2019s primary winner gets the nomination. In 2020, millions of Democrats in multiple states picked Sen. Bernie Sanders and their delegates supported him, but it was Biden who won the nomination. This year, Democrats\u2019 move to rally around Harris might make her the shoo-in nominee, but it does not preclude a challenge before the roll call vote. Expect lawsuits about this and for Republicans to keep up their complaints about the process. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said, without getting specific, that Republicans will look at ways to challenge a late replacement. But legal experts think such challenges have little likelihood of success, CNN has reported. Finally, just as the Supreme Court made clear that voters should have access to the candidate of their choice when it rejected efforts to disqualify Trump from the ballot, it seems like the court might protect the right of Democrats to field a candidate. There\u2019s plenty of time. The election is still months away. Republicans just presented their case at the Republican National Convention last week. Democrats get their turn in August. Presumably, Harris\u2019 proposals will not depart too drastically from Biden. While Trump has changed the GOP, there are many predictable divides between the parties. Democrats prize abortion rights; Republicans don\u2019t. Democrats want to act to combat climate change; Republicans largely don\u2019t. Both parties say they will protect Social Security and Medicare benefits, but neither is talking about long-term solutions. Democrats will try to raise taxes on Americans making more than $400,000 per year; Republicans have said they will try to lower taxes. Republicans, under Trump, are largely opposed to foreign aid to help democracies worldwide, and Democrats largely support those measures. Nope. This is a question that appears to be on a lot of people\u2019s minds. The former first lady is incredibly popular within the Democratic Party and in the country at large. But she has consistently swatted away any idea that she might be interested in a White House run. \u201cI will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it,\u201d Obama said in 2016. More recently, she told Oprah in a Netflix special from 2023 that politics is hard and a candidate has got to want to run in the same way that they want children and a family. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul,\u201d she said, adding she is more effective outside of politics. We\u2019re getting deep into hypotheticals here. Biden has not said anything about resigning and, quite the opposite, has promised to finish his term, which ends on January 20, 2025. If he were to resign, Harris would become president, according to the 25th Amendment. She would then pick a vice president, who would be approved by majority vote in both chambers of Congress. Johnson only comes into play in the presidential line of succession if both the president and vice president roles are somehow simultaneously vacant. There are multiple examples in US history of vacancies in the vice presidency. Most recently, Vice President Gerald Ford became president when Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974. But Ford\u2019s pick to be vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, was not sworn in until December of that year. There\u2019s nothing to keep a former president from being involved in politics, but, with the exception of Trump, they rarely do. John Quincy Adams went from being president during the 19th century to a long career in the US House of Representatives. President William Howard Taft was never a natural politician and lost the 1912 presidential election in a three-way race that featured his predecessor, Teddy Roosevelt, running as a Progressive, and the ultimate winner, Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Years later, in 1921, President Warren G. Harding would make Taft chief justice of the US Supreme Court. More recently, presidents have settled into long and lucrative post-presidencies outside of the political eye. That\u2019s a subjective assessment. There was a primary process and Democrats rallied behind Biden during that process. When it became clear he was not up to running and serving another four years, they pressured him to step aside. Now, the 3,949 pledged Democratic delegates \u2013 most of them community leaders from around the country \u2013 will join roughly 750 party leaders to select a replacement nominee. Democrats have said the process should be an open one. Only Harris has risen so far, and she has a massive amount of support among elected officials and delegates we\u2019ve talked to. Does that sound like a backroom deal? If so, you\u2019re among the large number of Americans frustrated by a primary process dominated by the two major political parties. Does it sound like a party pivoting, under its rules, to address the realization that its candidate should not continue? That\u2019s also a legitimate take.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_trump-new-york-appeals-court-civil-judgement", "text": "Lawyers for Donald Trump asked a New York appeals court Monday to throw out the $454 million judgment in his civil fraud trial, arguing that the monetary penalty was unconstitutional and that most of the case should have been barred because the conduct was too old. The former president\u2019s attorneys raised several other legal arguments they lost at the trial court-level, including that no bank or counterparty lost money on loans, saying the judge made reversal mistakes in his rulings. The filings are Trump\u2019s latest attempt to throw out the\u00a0$454 million judgment\u00a0levied by state Judge Arthur Engoron in February, who found Trump, two of his sons \u2013 Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump \u2013 and their real estate business liable for fraud. The New York attorney general\u2019s office will file their opposition papers next month. The appeals court could take up the case as soon as September. \u201cThe award of $464 million in a case with no victims, no proven injuries, and no losses is not remotely defensible,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. The additional $10 million relates to other defendants in the case. \u201cThe \u2018actual harm inflicted\u2019 is nil,\u201d they argued. \u201cThus, any punitive award would result in a ratio that is virtually infinite. The award of $464 million in a case with no victims, no proven injuries, and no losses is not remotely defensible.\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys said Engoron erred when he declined to toss most of the case after the appeals court ruled last year before the civil trial that certain conduct fell outside of the statute of limitations. According to Trump\u2019s attorneys, Trump personally should have been dismissed as a defendant. If the statute of limitations was enforced, they argue, roughly $350 million of the judgment would be wiped out. The state appeals court previously dismissed Ivanka Trump as a co-defendant in the case before the trial last year, finding she was not an employee of the Trump Organization at the time a tolling agreement \u2013 or deal to stop the clock on the statute of limitations \u2013 was struck. In the filing Monday, they argued that Trump should have also been excluded from the case. Trump\u2019s attorneys asserted that the only claims in the attorney general\u2019s complaint that were timely were the loans for the Old Post Office building in Washington, DC, and the 40 Wall Street building in Manhattan. \u201cApplying the correct statute of limitations eliminates $350,980,057 of the $464,576,229 judgment for Appellants bound by the Tolling Agreement, and it eliminates all of the judgment for those not bound by the Tolling Agreement, including the Trust and the individual Appellant,\u201d they wrote. Engoron ruled before the trial that even if the loans were closed before the 2014 statute of limitations, fraudulent financial statements that were subsequently issued constituted separate fraudulent acts. The judge wrote in a decision at the time that New York Attorney General Letitia James was not \u201cchallenging the loans, the closings, or the disbursements,\u201d but was challenging the financial documents containing false and misleading information. The Trump attorneys accused Engoron of enacting a \u201cpunitive\u201d penalty against the former president that was unconstitutional. \u201cThe monetary award is a punitive penalty imposed for retributive and deterrent purposes. It is both grossly disproportional under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause and grossly excessive under the Due Process Clauses,\u201d Trump\u2019s team argued. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that Engoron incorrectly ordered him to pay too much in disgorgement \u2013 or the return of ill-gotten gains \u2013 for the sale proceeds of the Old Post Office and Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point. Engoron did\u00a0not\u00a0account for any investments Trump\u2019s company had put into the properties when he ordered the Trump Organization to pay back the full proceeds amount rather than calculating their net profit, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued. Trump\u2019s lawyers say Engoron made uninformed judgments as to the valuations of Trump\u2019s properties without considering any expert testimony when he ruled in the summary judgment that Trump inflated his asset value, the filing says. Just like at trial, Trump\u2019s lawyers in particular took issue with a reference in Engoron\u2019s summary judgment opinion that Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort was valued at $18 million. \u201cSupreme Court engaged in a series of erroneous valuations of President Trump\u2019s properties, including valuing Mar-a-Lago at $18 to $27.6 million, a tiny fraction of its obvious value, and these errors infected the subsequent trial,\u201d they wrote. During the trial, Engoron said that he was not trying to assess the value of the property when he referenced the tax assessor value. Trump, when he testified, said Mar-a-Lago was worth at least $1 billion. In a statement on Monday\u2019s filing, Trump attorney Chris Kise called for a \u201ccomplete reversal\u201d of the judgment. \u201cSuch an outrageous miscarriage of justice is profoundly un-American, and a complete reversal is the only means available to restore public confidence in the integrity of the New York judicial system,\u201d Kise said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/trump-new-york-appeals-court-civil-judgement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_democratic-voters-kamala-harris-excitement", "text": "Live to 94 like Pat Levin, and you think maybe you have seen it all. Well, think again. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thrown into an emotional tailspin,\u201d is how Levin described President Joe Biden\u2019s abrupt departure from the 2024 campaign this weekend and his quick endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cWhat next? An\u00a0enormous feeling of relief along with an enormous feeling of anxiety.\u201d Oh, plus this: \u201cYes, I support Harris.\u201d That was the consensus among Democrats in our All Over the Map project, which is tracking the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of key voters. We heard relief that the president stepped away from a campaign that was on a path to likely defeat, worry that there is not enough time to turn things around, and support for Harris to take the baton. \u201cI\u2019ve always said it needs to be Vice President Harris,\u201d said Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee\u2019s Black neighborhoods. \u201cShe\u2019s the first Black woman VP and I think it would be seen as a sign of disrespect to have someone seemingly jump ahead of her.\u201d Michigan auto worker Tonya Rincon described herself as \u201ckind of stunned\u201d by Biden\u2019s decision but said Democrats have no time to waste. \u201cVice President Harris is the obvious choice,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cShe\u2019s experienced. Qualified. An extremely strong candidate and we need to get behind her immediately.\u201d There was overwhelming support for the California Democrat, but not unanimity. On the plus side for Harris: Democratic voters think she can rebuild lagging Biden support in the Black community and among younger voters, and they see her as a more vibrant and aggressive campaigner on abortion rights and other issues viewed as critical motivators for Democratic voters. But the doubts some voters raised about Harris underscore the challenges ahead, assuming she emerges as the Democratic nominee. They range from concerns the process will become too messy to worries that she is not the strongest candidate to contest critical battleground states. \u201cIf it\u2019s Kamala, her choice of a VP must be the absolute best,\u201d said Darrell Ann Murphy, a retiree in Pennsylvania\u2019s bellwether Northampton County. \u201cI wonder if the country is ready for a Black woman president,\u201d said Walter Robinson Jr., an African American union auto worker.\u00a0\u201cShe wasn\u2019t seen so much during her term (as vice president), so I\u2019m still processing the whole thing.\u201d Likewise, Carey Fulks, an African American from Atlanta, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe Harris is a strong enough candidate to take the presidency this close to the election. \u2026 Democrats might rally around Harris, but I don\u2019t know about undecided voters.\u201d Some uncommitted voters not happy with \u2018absentee VP\u2019 A Harris campaign would face the same daunting challenge that factored into Biden\u2019s exit from the race: Former President Donald Trump is ahead in major battleground states, at least in polling taken before Biden bowed out. Any Democratic path to victory runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and leading Democrats in those states say the vice president has a lot to prove. Our project includes voters in 10 states, and several who are undecided or at least not firmly committed to a candidate were quick to take issue with Harris as Biden\u2019s replacement. Allen Naparalla, who runs a winery in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, said Biden waited too long. \u201cHe was just too old to be president anymore,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kamala Harris has it in her to be a competent president.\u201d Antonio Munoz, who owns a restaurant and catering business in Las Vegas, texted two words when asked about the change: \u201cMichelle Obama.\u201d Ray Flores, who owns a handful of restaurants in Tucson, Arizona, was also nonplussed by the Democrats\u2019 changing of the guard. \u201cOur country is lost,\u201d said Flores, who is deeply disillusioned with both major political parties. \u201cWe have serious issues, but issues aren\u2019t being considered, just the pocketbooks of the very rich and famous.\u201d Kim Cavaliere, a Georgia independent who backed Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, said she was happy Biden made the decision to step aside. \u201cHowever, I am not pleased with Harris running,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is this absentee VP?\u201d And Linda Rooney \u2013 a Republican from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, who backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary \u2013 likewise does not have a good impression of Harris. \u201cI think, personally, she has done a horrible job as VP,\u201d Rooney said. She is no fan of Trump and said she might vote Democratic if her governor, Josh Shapiro, emerged as the Biden replacement. \u201cIf Shapiro was the Dems\u2019 pick, I\u2019d be in a quandary about who to pick in November,\u201d Rooney said. Shapiro, however, was quick to endorse Harris. The swing state governor is on the list of possible Harris running mates. So is Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, whose name as a possible Harris vice presidential pick also came up as our voters shared their initial reaction to Biden\u2019s decision. \u201cHaving Mark Kelly at that level would be immensely beneficial for Arizona, as he would fight to protect our reproductive rights, veteran rights, and advocate against the deportation of veterans,\u201d said Melissa Cordero, an Air Force veteran who now works for a conservation group in Tucson. \u201cLet\u2019s continue to push for a ticket that prioritizes these crucial issues.\u201d Kelly, a veteran and former astronaut, was a first choice of Nanette Mees, a registered Republican in the northern Virginia suburbs who tends to vote Democratic for president because of abortion rights and, more recently, issues she has with Trump\u2019s character. \u201cOh boy, what a sad state our country is in,\u201d Mees said Sunday. \u201cMark Kelly would be good, but I think it\u2019s extremely sad that Trump is probably going to win.\u201d Like Mees, Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez is a longtime Republican but not a Trump fan. \u201cThere are no other Democrats I see as presidential,\u201d Sanchez said after Biden withdrew. \u201cI know it is going to be Kamala Harris. I hope they pick a Hispanic woman to be her running mate.\u201d Some of the reaction included unconventional suggestions, perhaps to be expected after such a tumultuous stretch in the campaign. Longtime Black activist and organizer in Milwaukee Davette Baker said, \u201cYes, we could make history\u201d if Harris won the presidency. But she said she was worried about whether Harris can win. Baker mentioned Arizona\u2019s Kelly as an option, and then added this: \u201cIf we did want to try a woman, we could get Liz Cheney.\u201d\u00a0The former Wyoming congresswoman, a conservative who lost a primary to a Trump-backed challenger, is one of the former president\u2019s fiercest critics. Optimism about the Harris-Trump contrast While acknowledging significant challenges, many of the Democratic voters in our group were energized by the weekend drama, believing that Biden had virtually no chance of winning and that a new ticket at least might. \u201cIt was for the best,\u201d said Eric Jones, an African American entrepreneur in Milwaukee. \u201cNow, the Dems have a chance.\u201d Summer Matkin, a college student in Detroit who was undecided because she opposes Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, described Harris as \u201ca strong pick\u201d to lead the Democratic ticket. And Jade Gray, a recent University of Michigan graduate who was co-president of the campus College Democrats, said her phone was busy Sunday with excited texts from friends. \u201cSpecifically, about the felon vs. prosecutor angle that a Trump vs. Harris race would have,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI know I\u2019d like to see them in a debate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/democratic-voters-kamala-harris-excitement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_israeli-national-security-officials-netanyhu-letter", "text": "A group of senior Israeli figures including former\u00a0national security officials, academics and business leaders have sent US congressional leadership a blistering letter accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is set to speak to Congress on Wednesday, of threatening both Israeli and American national security. The letter calls Netanyahu an \u201cexistential threat\u201d and paints\u00a0him\u00a0as selfishly concerned with his political survival and singularly to blame for failing to defeat Hamas in the current war in Gaza. It also highlights Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing\u00a0legal troubles, including\u00a0the fact he\u2019s been\u00a0being charged with bribery and fraud. Among the more than 30 signatories are five former senior officials from the Mossad intelligence service, including retired director Tamir Pardo, two former heads of the Israeli military and a wide-ranging list of other former military, security, diplomatic, legal and business officials. Nobel laureate for Chemistry Aaron Ciechanover is among them, as are two former presidents of Ben Gurion University, Avishay Braverman and Rivka Carmi. Billionaire entrepreneur Morris Kahn joins former pharmaceutical CEO Jeremy Levin among the business leaders. \u201cFor decades, [Netanyahu] has been inciting Israelis against each other, damaging our national social fabric, dramatically harming our defense capabilities, eroding our economy and devastating our international standing,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cNetanyahu severely harms the US national security interests through his approach to this war, which adversely impacts American policy in the Middle East and beyond and further endangers Israel,\u201d it continues. The letter was\u00a0sent on Tuesday morning to House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck\u00a0Schumer and\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Pardo, the former Mossad director, last month called on Congress to\u00a0disinvite Netanyahu, calling the invitation a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d Another\u00a0signatory, Alon Pinkas, who served as Israel\u2019s Consul General in New York\u00a0in the early 2000s,\u00a0wrote\u00a0that Netanyahu is visiting Washington and speaking to Congress in order\u00a0\u201cto\u00a0hurt Biden and turn Israel into a larger partisan wedge issue ahead of the US presidential election on November 5.\u201d A similar letter \u2013 also signed by Pardo, Pinkas and others on Tuesday\u2019s letter \u2013 was\u00a0sent in January\u00a0to Israel\u2019s president and speaker of parliament demanding that Netanyahu be removed from office. Netanyahu\u2019s visit this week is a highly politicized affair: the Israeli prime minister was invited to speak to Congress by the Republican Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, while a\u00a0growing group\u00a0of Democrats have threatened to boycott the speech. \u201dBenjamin Netanyahu is a war criminal,\u201d said\u00a0independent\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders in a\u00a0statement. \u201cHe should not be invited to address a joint meeting of Congress. I certainly will not attend.\u201d In March, Schumer, one of Israel\u2019s most stalwart allies in Congress and the first Jewish\u00a0majority leader, called on Netanyahu to resign and for new elections in Israel. There were early questions about whether Netanyahu would even get a White House meeting during the trip, as his relationship with\u00a0President Joe\u00a0Biden has gotten increasingly strained during the course of the war, now in its tenth month. The leaders are now expected to meet, with the timing in flux due to Biden\u2019s\u00a0Covid-19 diagnosis. The specifics of Netanyahu\u2019s speech remain closely held with many waiting to see whether it will echo his 2015 address to Congress in which he slammed the Iran deal brokered by the Obama administration. The Obama White House had been\u00a0blindsided\u00a0by Netanyahu\u2019s decision to address Congress after another invitation from a Republican House\u00a0speaker, John Boehner.\u00a0Dozens\u00a0of Democrats skipped that speech,\u00a0as did then-Vice President Biden who was traveling. Typically, a vice president, in their role as president of the Senate, would attend and sit prominently on the dais. However, Vice\u00a0President Kamala Harris will also miss Netanyahu\u2019s Wednesday speech due to travel, which\u00a0Biden\u2019s national\u00a0security\u00a0adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan said\u00a0Friday\u00a0he did not expect\u00a0to be\u00a0a repeat of 2015. \u201cThey [Netanyahu\u2019s team] said he\u2019s intending to reinforce a set of themes and arguments that are not at odds or in contradiction to our policy, American policy, but they\u2019re gonna keep working that speech till the very last minute, just like we do on our side,\u201d\u00a0Sullivan\u00a0said at the Aspen Security Forum. He added that the White House expects Netanyahu to preview \u201cin pretty specific terms\u201d to Biden \u201cwhat he intends to say.\u201d The visit comes also at a critical time in the negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. Senior US officials say Netanyahu has signed on to the framework Biden proposed in May but critics of the prime minister\u2019s have accused him of adding specifics that could thwart the deal. \u201cNetanyahu obstructed a war strategy for their [the hostages\u2019] release, prevented an essential discussion of National Strategic Goals for the war, and abandoned the abductees in Gaza,\u201d the letter to Congress reads. Netanyahu is well-known to Americans, having first become prime minister in 1996. Just 35% of Americans view him favorably, according to a\u00a0poll this month\u00a0by Gallup, with his unfavorability climbing sharply in the last five years. More Americans disapprove of Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza than approve, according to the same poll. As Israel becomes more of a partisan issue in US politics, the signatories of Tuesday letter warn of what Netanyahu\u2019s visit could do to the relationship. \u201cWe thank you for your continued support and urge you\u00a0to remain stalwart allies of Israel,\u201d they conclude, \u201cand encourage Prime Minister Netanyahu to put the safety, security and future of Israel and the Israeli-US strategic relations before his own political and personal interests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/israeli-national-security-officials-netanyhu-letter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_trump-campaign-fec-complaint-block-biden-harris-funds", "text": "The Trump campaign on Tuesday filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing money raised for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid cannot be transferred to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign. The complaint was filed by the Trump campaign\u2019s general counsel David Warrington and argues transferring the funds would amount to \u201clittle more than a thinly veiled $91.5 million excessive contribution from one presidential candidate to another.\u201d \u201cKamala Harris is seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden\u2019s leftover campaign cash \u2014 a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended,\u201d\u00a0the complaint, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, states. The complaint is against Biden, Harris, the Biden campaign (which is now the Harris campaign) and campaign treasurer Keana Spencer for allegedly \u201cflagrantly violating the Act by making and receiving an excessive contribution of nearly one hundred million dollars, and for filing fraudulent forms with the Commission purporting to repurpose one candidate\u2019s principal campaign committee for the use of another candidate.\u201d Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Kretchmer Lutvak responded to the FEC complaint in a statement Tuesday, saying, \u201cRepublicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims \u2013 like the ones they\u2019ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections \u2013 will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election.\u201d The statement also cited the campaign\u2019s fundraising efforts so far, \u201craising $100 million in our first 36 hours and signing up 58,000 volunteers.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that the commission would take any action until well after Election Day, given its slow pace of resolving enforcement questions. \u201cI don\u2019t think most campaign finance lawyers believe that this is a best reading of the law,\u201d Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA\u2019s law school, told CNN on Tuesday of the Trump campaign\u2019s argument. But, he added, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t get tied up in FEC proceedings for years.\u201d An FEC spokesperson declined to comment, citing the agency\u2019s policy on not discussing enforcement matters. Veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies, who briefly served as the RNC\u2019s general counsel earlier this year, argued recently that the Biden-Harris team must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted. \u201cIf President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he\u2019ll first have to become his party\u2019s legal nominee,\u201d Spies wrote in an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0in The Wall Street Journal before Biden\u2019s exit from the race. But other campaign finance experts disagree. And Federal Election Commissioner Dara\u00a0Lindenbaum, a Democrat viewed as a swing vote on the evenly divided commission, has said Harris could access what Biden raised through the campaign committee because it is registered for both the president and vice president. Lindenbaum\u00a0wrote on X, \u201cIf Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic Party nominee, she gets access to the Joe Biden campaign funds.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/trump-campaign-fec-complaint-block-biden-harris-funds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_rudy-giuliani-mike-lindell-travel-rnc", "text": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s trip to Milwaukee for last week\u2019s Republican National Convention was bankrolled by the media platform started by \u201cMy Pillow Guy\u201d Mike Lindell, Giuliani\u2019s lawyer told a bankruptcy court that is scrutinizing the former New York\u00a0City\u00a0mayor\u2019s finances. The letter from Giuliani\u2019s lawyer said that both Giuliani\u2019s flight and hotel were covered by FrankSpeech and\u00a0included in the submission to the court was a statement signed\u00a0by\u00a0Lindell on behalf of the media company confirming it paid for the trip. A CNN reporter saw Giuliani in the first class section of a flight to Milwaukee before the RNC, and Giuliani\u2019s attorney said he wanted to clear up \u201can unsubstantiated rumor\u201d\u00a0that the former Donald Trump lawyer paid for the trip himself. Lindell told CNN on Tuesday that Giuliani is an employee of the media company, but declined to say how much he was being paid for the job, which he said started July 1. The letter comes after a federal judge has struggled to close the proceedings in his bankruptcy case because of a dispute over Giuliani\u2019s ability to pay for the expenses related to the case. Giuliani owes about $350,000 for a forensic accountant, which the bankruptcy judge is trying to get him to pay or reach a deal to partially pay now. That\u2019s in addition to the approximate $150 million\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0owes to creditors, including to two Georgia election workers he defamed after the 2020 election while he was working for Trump. The election workers, mother and daughter Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, are likely to pursue the two properties he owns, in New York City and Palm Beach,\u00a0Florida, to satisfy a few million dollars of Giuliani\u2019s debt to them. Judge Sean Lane of the federal bankruptcy court in White Plains, New York, is expected to issue a ruling any day on how to move forward. The judge previously\u00a0told\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s attorneys that \u201cthere are a lot of bad things that can happen\u201d if Giuliani doesn\u2019t step up to reach a deal with his creditors on payment for the accounting expenses. Creditors have been attempting to trace Giuliani\u2019s expenditures around the\u00a0RNC. They have only been able to obtain so far transactions of Giuliani\u2019s personal debit card \u2013 not cards he typically uses for charges. That revealed only nominal purchases by the former mayor in Milwaukee,\u00a0such as two charges for less than $100 at a hotel,\u00a0according to a person familiar\u00a0with the payment. Lindell told CNN on Tuesday that he paid for Giuliani\u2019s travel because the former New York\u00a0mayor was hired on July 1 as a host for Lindell\u2019s right-wing broadcast platform, FrankSpeech TV. \u201cI flew everybody in from my crews and hosts,\u201d Lindell said. He said he flies all his hosts first class for ease of travel. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s living the life of luxury,\u201d Lindell said of Giuliani. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a company thing where that\u2019s just what we do.\u201d Giuliani has an agreement for a daily one-hour show on Frank Speech, his attorney Gary C. Fischoff told CNN, adding that the agreement was disclosed in the bankruptcy proceedings. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on the convention floor last week, Giuliani claimed that his bankruptcy case was being dismissed because the \u201cjudge was preventing me from appealing the very unfair $145 million judgment\u201d in favor of the election workers in the defamation. Giuliani went on to assert without evidence\u00a0that Moss and Freeman\u2019s lawyers were \u201cpaid for by Biden\u201d as he claimed that the \u201clawyer in charge was a partner of Hunter Biden.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re paid for by somebody,\u201d Giuliani said when Collins disputed his claims. Giuliani said\u00a0he\u00a0had \u201cno regrets at all\u201d about how he treated Moss and Freeman during the 2020 election. \u201cThat court is a disgrace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will go down in history\u00a0\u2026\u00a0as a court that participated in another internment, like the Japanese internment during the Second War.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/rudy-giuliani-mike-lindell-travel-rnc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_kamala-harris-democratic-nomination", "text": "After potential rivals,\u00a0lawmakers, governors and influential labor and advocacy groups all lined up behind Vice President Kamala Harris, a wave of endorsements from state delegations Monday evening pushed her over the threshold needed to secure the Democratic nomination. She\u2019s been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate \u2014 a moment that arrived on the first full day of her campaign. And with no credible challenger emerging the day after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed his vice president, it was already clear that the biggest remaining question about the 2024 Democratic ticket is who Harris will choose as her running mate. Harris, who will hold a campaign event in Milwaukee on Tuesday, staked her claim to the party\u2019s standard-bearer role with an electric speech Monday evening, as she visited the campaign\u2019s headquarters in Delaware. The vice president informed staffers who had been working for the Biden-led campaign that they\u2019d remain onboard \u2014 and that campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and campaign manager\u00a0Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez would remain at the helm. And she laid out her case against Donald Trump, invoking a host of the former president\u2019s scandals and legal troubles. She pointed to her time as a district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she \u201ctook on perpetrators of all kinds.\u201d \u201cPredators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type.\u201d In her first day as a candidate, Harris raised $81 million, the campaign announced Monday, saying it was the largest 24-hour raise by any candidate ever. The huge haul underscored grassroots enthusiasm for a shake-up to the Democratic 2024 ticket. According to the campaign, more than 880,000 \u201cgrassroots supporters\u201d donated, with 60% making their first contributions of the 2024 cycle. Democratic donation-processing site ActBlue called it \u201cthe biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.\u201d The Democratic super PAC Future Forward secured $150 million in commitments from donors in the 24 hours after Biden announced his decision, a senior aide to the group said.\u00a0The commitments came from donors who were either uncommitted, unsure or previously stalled, the aide added. Four\u00a0governors of must-win Midwestern states \u2014 Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota\u2019s Tim Walz,\u00a0Wisconsin\u2019s Tony Evers\u00a0and Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker \u2014 have endorsed Harris. They join endorsements from Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper, California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro. Many of those governors could be considered for the party\u2019s vice presidential nomination. Meanwhile, the cascade of endorsements for Harris\u2019 candidacy that had begun Sunday afternoon accelerated on Capitol Hill.\u00a0Harris has the support of more than\u00a040\u00a0Democratic senators and\u00a0nearly 100\u00a0House members \u2014 numbers that had grown rapidly throughout Monday morning. A significant one came from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said in a Monday afternoon statement that her \u201centhusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top-ranking Democrats in each chamber, were set to endorse Harris\u00a0soon, according to multiple sources familiar with the decision. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the second- and third-ranking House Democrats, endorsed Harris on Monday morning. She also has the support of the political arms of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as two key labor unions, Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers. Support for the vice president came across the party\u2019s ideological spectrum \u2014 from moderate populists, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents on the ballot this fall, to progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The hour-by-hour endorsements of Harris from Democratic governors, senators, Cabinet officials and state delegations unfolded by design, with the hope of reaching a majority of delegates by Wednesday, two people familiar with the process tell CNN. Harris beat that timeline on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a coordinated drumbeat,\u201d a senior Democratic aide working on the effort said. \u201cThat sound Democrats hear is the party uniting around the vice president.\u201d Delegate endorsements \u2014 which are not binding \u2014 continue to come in. How Harris and her allies mobilized Joe Biden\u2019s 1:46 p.m. ET Sunday announcement that he would not seek a second term ignited a frenetic push by Harris to consolidate the support of a party that had been in crisis in the weeks since the president\u2019s dismal performance during his June 27 debate with Trump. Harris knew what Biden had decided: She\u2019d had multiple phone calls with Biden on Sunday, a person familiar with the matter said. Once the announcement came, Harris \u2014 wearing a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University, workout sweats and sneakers \u2014 made more than 100 phone calls over 10 hours. Alongside her family and staff, the vice president\u2019s calls included lawmakers, governors and leaders of influential labor, advocacy and civil rights groups. Those calls included former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Clintons, in a statement Sunday, endorsed Harris; Obama did not, deferring to the party\u2019s process. Harris also called her pastor, Amos Brown III, who, along with his wife, prayed over her, the source said. She ate pizza with anchovies \u2014 Harris\u2019 go-to topping \u2014 for dinner. In those phone calls, Harris made clear that while she was grateful for Biden\u2019s endorsement, she planned to earn the Democratic nomination in her own right. That echoes the statement she released following Biden\u2019s announcement to step aside. \u201cI am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\u201d she wrote. Harris\u2019 supporters were also mobilizing. Harris\u2019 chief of staff Lorraine Voles and California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis led a call Monday morning with around 350 Democratic donors, fundraisers and supporters, a longtime Democratic fundraiser and supporter of Harris for many years told CNN. The source, who was on the call, said by gathering Harris\u2019 core supporters from her previous campaigns and newly interested donors, they hoped to get everyone to \u201crow the right way.\u201d The group Win With Black Women periodically holds Zoom calls \u2014 but the one that took place Sunday evening had a different tone, with 44,000 people joining, according to its leaders. Longtime Democratic operative Donna Brazile said that she was in the process of gathering delegates to support Harris. \u201cI need all of you to sign your delegate pledge forms now,\u201d Brazile said on the call. She said voter registration and fundraising will be key in the days ahead. Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser also spoke on the call. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in the crosshairs of Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to defend our sister.\u201d Former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett were also among the speakers. Vice President Kamala Harris, a former US senator from California who previously served as the state's attorney general, could be the first Black woman and Asian American to lead a major party ticket after receiving President Joe Biden's support to become the next Democratic presidential nominee. \"I am honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" she said in a statement on Sunday, July 21.The historic endorsement came after Biden announced that he was dropping out of the race following weeks of disarray within the Democratic Party. By the next day, CNN estimated that Harris had secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to win the nomination.Harris became the first female vice president of the United States when she was sworn into office in January 2021. She is also the nation's first Black and South Asian vice president.\"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\" Harris said in her first speech to the nation as vice president-elect. No serious challenger materializes yet No serious challenger has emerged to take on Harris for the nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts August 19 in Chicago. Any challenge might need to materialize even faster: The Democratic National Committee is moving forward with a process that will determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee by August 7, party officials said Monday night. Manchin, who had left the party earlier this year and is not seeking reelection, said Monday he will not rejoin the party and seek its nomination. CNN has previously reported the West Virginia senator was considering re-registering as a Democrat to throw his hat in the ring. But in an interview with CBS News on Monday, Manchin said he will not be a candidate. \u201cI could not believe that there was not going to be a primary process or a mini process. Other countries do it,\u201d Manchin said, adding that he believes Harris is too liberal but could be forced to the middle if she faces a challenge. New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams announced his support for Harris in an interview with MSNBC on Monday, reversing course just hours after he told CNN, \u201cthere\u2019s a process and we\u2019re going to follow that process,\u201d to determine the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cWe need real, clear, leadership, and she understands it,\u201d Adams told MSNBC. \u201cShe was in the position of looking over the border issue, so she understands some of the things that we need to do.\u201d And he offered a stirring endorsement of Harris\u2019 fitness to lead the ticket, urging advisers to \u201clet her be her.\u201d Running mate jockeying begins Democratic lawyers are beginning their work conducting a deep, yet truncated, vetting process for potential vice presidential hopefuls, two people familiar with the matter told CNN, with siloed teams being established for the leading prospective candidates. Cooper, Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are among the Democrats who have been asked to submit information about their finances, family histories and other personal details, two people familiar with the process said. They are part of a group that includes about 10 names, nearly all of whom are elected officials. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm Covington & Burling will handle vetting for Harris\u2019 running mate, a source familiar with the plans said. The audition process is also playing out in public, with Cooper and Beshear appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday \u2014\u00a0with the intent that Harris was watching. An aide said she caught at least part of the conversations. Beshear, the two-term Kentucky governor, announced his support for Harris \u2014 and said he is open to joining Harris as her potential running mate, noting it\u2019s \u201cflattering to be a part\u201d of the conversation about the vice-presidential nomination. He also offered a window into how he\u2019d play the traditional attack-dog role of a running mate. At multiple points in the interview, Beshear attacked Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who has family ties to Beshear\u2019s home state of Kentucky. \u201cLet me just tell you that JD Vance ain\u2019t from here,\u201d Beshear said, referring to his home state, taking issue with how Vance described Appalachia in his best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d Beshear also attacked Vance for past comments expressing support for strict restrictions to abortion access, while touting Harris\u2019 record of supporting protections for reproductive health care. \u201cJD Vance calls pregnancy arising from rape \u2018inconvenient,\u2019\u201d Beshear said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just plain wrong. He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Now listen, a domestic abuser isn\u2019t a man, he\u2019s a monster, and no one should support anyone having to stay in those relationships.\u201d Cooper, the North Carolina governor who endorsed Harris on Sunday, also appeared on MSNBC on Monday, but deflected questions about whether he would be open to becoming her running mate. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we do keep the focus on her this week. The vice-presidential conversation needs to occur later,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI want to make sure that Kamala Harris wins. I\u2019m going to work for her all over this country and do what I can to make sure we stop Donald Trump.\u201d Whitmer, the Michigan governor, told a local reporter she\u2019s \u201cnot planning to go anywhere\u201d when asked Monday if she would accept the vice presidential role if offered. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that\u00a0\u201cobviously, if somebody asks, I\u2019d take a serious look at it,\u201d but that \u201cmy phone hasn\u2019t rung yet.\u201d \u201cIf they do the polling and it turns out that they need a 49-year-old, balding, gay Jew from Boulder, Colorado, they got my number,\u201d Polis quipped.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_biden-title-ix-protections-supreme-court", "text": "The Biden administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to let it enforce new anti-discrimination rules in schools, including protections for pregnant women and women who have had abortions. The administration asked the court in two separate requests to let it enforce some of the new\u00a0rules\u00a0starting next month while lower courts consider the legality of other rules\u00a0that were meant to shore up\u00a0civil rights\u00a0protections for LGBTQ+ students. Earlier this year, the Department of Education unveiled changes to\u00a0rules under\u00a0Title IX, the decades-old law that bars sex discrimination in schools, including sexual violence and sex-based harassment. The changes were set to take effect nationwide in August. Among other things, the new rules\u00a0would prohibit\u00a0discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions like childbirth, termination of pregnancy\u00a0or recovery from pregnancy. But a number of GOP attorneys general\u00a0sued\u00a0the administration\u00a0to block enforcement of the expanded protections for\u00a0LGBTQ+ students.\u00a0Those changes aim to curb discrimination \u201cbased on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics,\u201d\u00a0according to the Department of Education. Last month,\u00a0two federal judges in separate cases blocked enforcement of all\u00a0of the new Title IX rules\u00a0in 10 states. The Biden administration asked appeals courts\u00a0to modify\u00a0those injunctions so that they only covered the changes related to LGBTQ+ students \u2013 which were specifically challenged in court \u2013 but the courts recently denied those requests. Now, the administration has turned to the\u00a0Supreme Court, arguing that the lower courts \u201cplainly erred\u201d when they blocked enforcement of the changes in full. \u201cThe district court\u2019s sweeping injunction prevents the Department from fulfilling its statutory mandate to effectuate Title IX,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers. \u201cThe harm is particularly acute here because Title IX is one of the core federal civil rights statutes that guarantees nondiscrimination in the Nation\u2019s education system.\u201d Prelogar said that if the Supreme Court does not scale back the injunctions, the Department of Education \u201cwill be unable to vindicate the critical protections of that statute in a wide swath of the country because of an overbroad injunction.\u201d Specifically, the solicitor general pointed out that the\u00a0GOP-led\u00a0lawsuits did not challenge the\u00a0rule changes that address protections for\u00a0pregnant and postpartum students, including access to lactation spaces and prohibitions on retaliation. The states challenging the changes, Prelogar told the court, \u201cdo not contend\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0the lower courts did not purport to hold\u00a0\u2013 that\u00a0those provisions conflict with Title IX, the Constitution, or any other federal law.\u201d \u201cThe legal disputes concerning Title IX\u2019s application to gender-identity discrimination thus provide no justification for delaying or blocking the implementation of those important and unrelated reforms,\u201d she wrote. The lower-court orders blocked the changes to Title IX from taking effect in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho. Compliance with\u00a0Title IX\u00a0rules is required to receive federal education aid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/biden-title-ix-protections-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters", "text": "It is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign. But it is rare, and no president until President Joe Biden has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness. One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than Biden \u2013 he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013  would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns. Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s departure is the latest such decision in history. Johnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does. Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right. But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection. Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House. Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden had the Democratic nomination sewn up, and he chose to give it up. Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate. Roosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another. Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten\u00a0strips of paper\u00a0given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election.\u00a0The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise. Three 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats. James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said: Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents. Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president. Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction. Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876. Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate.

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d  We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this. You know what I mean?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/wisconsin-voters-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_harris-campaign-headquarters-staff", "text": "No previous American candidate has ever launched a presidential campaign with the race already this much in motion. It\u2019s like changing the quarterback, team mascot and entire playbook halfway through the third quarter. Advisers to\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden and\u00a0Vice President\u00a0Kamala Harris have already agreed to start planning joint events\u00a0for them\u00a0into the summer and fall, people involved in the discussions told CNN, and now top aides are trying to get their campaign operations to mesh\u00a0too, after Harris won endorsements from enough delegates Monday night to win the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cThis campaign was built to elect Joe Biden. But now it has to retool to elect Kamala Harris, who\u2019s a Black and South Asian woman in the year 2024,\u201d said one aide at campaign headquarters. The vice president is inheriting a staff that she did not pick, working at a headquarters in a state she has no connection to other than spending a few days there with Biden over the last four years, where the signs are quickly being replaced and staff are either excited or bracing themselves to get their new email addresses @kamalaharris.com\u00a0instead of @joebiden.com. And now, as Harris has to reconceive of herself as a candidate for president and start vetting her own running mates, she and the aides closest to her are trying to figure out how to take over the operation without upsetting the painstakingly worked out rhythms that had gotten Harris past most of the drama and difficulties that defined her first few years as vice president. In conversations with over a dozen aides on the campaign, in the White House and operatives working with both from the outside, many describe a campaign that had become a battered and dispirited mess \u2014 and that was true before Biden\u2019s debate performance or the subsequent weeks of barely fighting back against the Democratic mutiny. Days were spent trying to grind down anyone who voiced even a hint of skepticism about Biden. Attempts by younger staff to move creatively were often slowed down by an impenetrable Biden inner circle only a few years younger than\u00a0the 81-year-old\u00a0president and with an insistently different sense of news cycles and campaigning. Never have the people on what was, until Sunday afternoon, the very small core team around Harris felt so popular. They have been flooded with emails and texts with offers to help for weeks. Now they\u2019re drowning in even more. The changes coming, several involved say, are about more than personnel or logos. \u201cHow do you get rid of this siege mentality and go on offense more?\u201d asked one Democratic operative in touch with multiple people on the campaign. Search continues for a \u2018Mike Donilon-type\u2019 Some clear change is coming. A campaign spokesman didn\u2019t have an answer on whether Mike Donilon, the longtime Biden guru who had left the West Wing to guide the campaign, will still be cutting ads for the vice president. But his expertise was in channeling Biden\u2019s voice and spirit, and few see a significant role for him ahead. Steve Ricchetti and Bruce Reed, the senior advisers to the president who bridged the West Wing and the political operation, will now focus mostly on guiding the president through the end of his term. Anita Dunn, who had recruited most of the top staff and continued to shape the campaign while staying at the White House, did not answer when CNN asked whether she would retain a role in helping Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s just 24 hours out. They are working around the clock to support the vice president and will do everything possible to help her defeat Trump,\u201d said one person close to the\u00a0Biden\u00a0inner circle, who also pointed out that Harris has already been having a weekly check-in with White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. Part of the issue is that Harris has long lacked anyone quite like those advisers\u00a0\u2014 to the point that last fall, her aides discussed trying to find what they referred to internally as a \u201cMike Donilon type\u201d for Harris. They didn\u2019t find one, and now there\u2019s no time to build trust with anyone they did find. \u201cBy definition, someone needs to tend to the store who is looking out for her,\u201d a Harris ally told CNN. Harris\u2019 brother-in-law Tony West, a former Justice Department official and longtime informal adviser who has been at her side the last few days, is expected to play a role. Her sister Maya, with whom she is extremely close, is expected to play a smaller one. Rahm Emanuel \u2014 the former Bill Clinton and House Democratic strategist who followed up his time as Chicago mayor by serving as Biden\u2019s ambassador to Japan \u2014 has had his name tossed around. Asked if he would want to\u00a0comment on\u00a0the speculation, Emanuel told CNN, \u201cNope.\u201d Others have suggested David\u00a0Plouffe, the architect of Barack Obama\u2019s historic presidential campaign, as one name being considered to lead the effort, two Democratic aides familiar with the conversations\u00a0told\u00a0CNN. But neither\u00a0Emanuel nor Plouffe,\u00a0their doubters have\u00a0pointed out, have run a campaign since Donald Trump entered politics. And while Harris made a point of announcing during her visit to the campaign headquarters\u00a0on Monday\u00a0that she would be keeping in place Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon as campaign chair and Julie Chavez Rodriguez as campaign manager \u2014 both of whom she has sparred with in the past \u2014\u00a0potential new senior adviser hires are also being discussed. O\u2019Malley Dillon staying on doesn\u2019t just pour water on the Emanuel and Plouffe rumors, it\u00a0also means that most of the senior staff is now expected to stay as well. And though she is still far from universally loved, she has won over some of the previous critics and kept the staff largely stabilized through the hellish last month. Aides are\u00a0also\u00a0discussing a shift on the larger media strategy, with an eye especially on changing the advertising approach and decision makers in that department. Some internally and externally are also looking to see a bigger operational and public role for Quentin Fulks, the deputy campaign manager who became a regular at Harris\u2019 unofficial political sessions at the Naval Observatory while also becoming a favorite of Biden for the way he loyally defended the president on TV. \u201cThe people in this office have been working so hard, and you have given so much of yourselves. \u2026 And you\u2019re giving yourselves because you love your country, and you love Joe, and you love me,\u201d Harris said during her visit to the headquarters. \u201cI have full faith that this team is the reason we will win in November.\u201d Even as several\u00a0campaign aides\u00a0are staking out moves on each other behind the scenes, they all agree that with just over 100 days to go until the election, the top priority is to avoid the rampant infighting that helped sink\u00a0Harris\u2019 2020\u00a0presidential campaign. That goes even for those who still hold grudges against her from\u00a0the previous\u00a0famous sputtering Biden debate performance, when she attacked him for being against school busing. \u201cLike the president would say himself, it\u2019s not about him and it\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s about stopping Donald Trump and the harm he would do to the American people,\u201d said a senior aide at headquarters. The changes won\u2019t just be on the campaign end. The vice president\u2019s team is expected to be much more involved in front-end strategic decision making in the White House, down to what policies and announcements are being rolled out where and when.\u00a0The West Wing staff has always\u00a0gone through everything with the lens of what\u00a0is best for\u00a0Biden\u2019s sensibilities and larger interests over all. That, they know, has to change immediately, but will happen as Harris\u2019 staff is asked to step in. Retaining hard fought Harris equilibrium Like Biden, Harris doesn\u2019t have a history of running great or well-functioning campaigns, whether that was her Senate race in 2016 or her 2020 presidential run that didn\u2019t even survive until December of 2019. Harris\u2019 past staff problems are the stuff of Washington legend, to the point that when she was sworn in as vice president, despite nearly two decades in three different previous offices, the number of even mid-level aides who had ever worked for her before could be counted on one hand.\u00a0Sometimes,\u00a0seemingly to cover for feeling unprepared for a meeting herself, she would slowly flay aides with cross-examination style questions. Sometimes, aides who have been through it told CNN, she would just do it for sport. Her\u00a0vice-presidential\u00a0office became known for distrust, infighting and traumatized aides who would retreat with tears in their eyes to bars near the White House, counting down the days until they got other job offers. Changes started to come a year and a half into the job. Harris got a new chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, who had both experience with a variety of campaigns, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s, and the trust of key figures in Biden\u2019s orbit. Everyone who had been on\u00a0Harris\u2019\u00a0press staff, including her first communications director and a press secretary who was already a personality in her own right, left in a matter of months. The issues didn\u2019t disappear immediately \u2014 she went through more staff and another communications director along the way \u2014 but the office started to get into a new rhythm.\u00a0Additions like adviser Megan Jones, recently elevated communications director Kirsten Allen, and Sheila Nix as her campaign chief of staff and Brian Fallon as her campaign communications director helped too. Internal drama plunged. And amid a sudden atmosphere of mostly functionality, a smoother and more confident Harris emerged. Her events were planned differently. She was prepped differently. Her new core team figured out how to manage and push back on her better. With just over 100 days to either get her elected or\u00a0see\u00a0Trump roll back into the White House, friends and aides who have watched the improvements and remember the dark days are terrified of regression. Any reassignments to Wilmington could upset the equilibrium they have achieved. Several who were there for the collapse of Harris\u2019 last campaign pointed to another reason to avoid making too many big changes: money running short in 2019 led to a round of layoffs, and vengeful staffers who were let go responded by feeding damaging stories about her, while those who stayed on formed into warring camps leaking on each other. One person on the campaign at the time ruefully joked that even the security guard at the front desk was phoning up reporters with gossip. So at least for now,\u00a0the campaign staff\u00a0are trying to hold to a line that deputy campaign manager and digital outreach specialist Rob Flaherty used on a call Monday afternoon that senior staff held. \u201cWe are,\u201d Flaherty said, \u201cjust cookin\u2019 and keeping it moving.\u201d Flaherty declined comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/harris-campaign-headquarters-staff/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night three of the Republican National Convention included former President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and other speakers who made false and misleading claims throughout the night. Here is a list of fact checks from CNN\u2019s Facts First team. Vance\u2019s misleading claim about Trump and the invasion of Iraq Former President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, insinuated in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that Trump had opposed the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Vance said that \u201cwhen I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq.\u201d After mentioning other past Biden positions as well, Vance said, \u201cSomehow, a real estate developer from New York City by the name of Donald J. Trump was right on all of these issues while Biden was wrong. President Trump knew, even then, that we needed leaders who would put America first.\u201d Facts First: Vance\u2019s claim is misleading. In reality, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq before it occurred. When radio host Howard Stern asked Trump in September 2002 whether he is \u201cfor invading Iraq,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d In his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump argued a military strike on Iraq might be necessary. And Trump did not express a firm opinion about the looming war in a Fox interview in January 2003, saying that \u201ceither you attack or don\u2019t attack\u201d and that then-President George W. Bush \u201chas either got to do something or not do something, perhaps.\u201d Trump began criticizing the war in 2003, after the invasion, and also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq.He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004, the year before Biden did. But Vance suggested Trump had been right on the invasion itself while Biden got it wrong, and there\u2019s no basis for the claim that they were on opposing sides of the issue. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Kimberly Guilfoyle claims that \u2018Trump handed Biden a booming economy\u2019 Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and former Fox News host, slammed Biden for his handling of the economy in her speech on the third night of the Republican National Convention. \u201cPresident Trump handed Biden a booming economy and a strong nation. All Joe had to do was leave it alone and take a nap,\u201d she said Wednesday. Facts First: Guilfoyle\u2019s comments are misleading. While the economy did well during the first three years of the Trump administration, it was upended by the Covid-19 pandemic. While it had recovered somewhat by the end of 2020, there were still multiple weak points heading into 2021, when Biden took office. The US economy grew at an annualized and seasonally adjusted rate of 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020. That would usually be a great rate, but it didn\u2019t make up for a weak first quarter and terrible second quarter spurred by the pandemic. For all of 2020, the GDP fell 3.5% from the prior year, the worst decline since 1946. Also, disposable incomes fell by 9.5% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the unemployment rate was 6.7% in December of that year. The US economy shed 140,000 jobs that month \u2014 a far worse outcome than economists predicted at the time. Covid-19 infections had increased that month, prompting some states to take additional containment measures. Trump was the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered, largely because of the pandemic. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby RNC video makes outdated claim about US wages A video that played before Vance\u2019s speech\u00a0hit Biden over his handling of the economy. \u201cUnder Biden, wages are going down while prices skyrocket,\u201d the video said. Facts first: The claim in the video is outdated. While inflation outpaced wages during the first half of the Biden administration, that reversed in the middle of last year. Inflation rose sharply during the early years of the Biden administration but has since slowed to an annual rate of 3% in June. In fact, prices fell in June for the first time since the start of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, real average hourly earnings \u2013 which takes inflation into account \u2013 began increasing in mid-2023. They rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis, from June 2023 to June 2024, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about the 2020 economy Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said in his opening remarks at the party convention on Wednesday: \u201cOur economy is not nearly as strong as it was four years ago.\u201d Facts First: This is false.Four years ago, in mid-2020, the US economy was in dire straits because of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, the June 2020 unemployment rate was 11%, well over double the June 2024 rate of 4.1%. In late July 2020, the federal government announced that the US economy had just experienced its worst contraction on record \u2013 shrinking by an annual rate of 32.9% in the quarter running from April 2020 through June 2020. We give politicians wide latitude to express opinions, and many Trump supporters have argued that the pre-pandemic economy under former Trump, in 2019 and prior, was stronger than the current Biden-era economy. That\u2019s a matter of subjective debate. But it\u2019s plainly inaccurate that the mid-2020 economy was superior to the current economy. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Newt Gingrich on the war in Afghanistan under Trump Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich claimed that \u201cPresident Trump orchestrated an orderly end to the Afghanistan war with no American killed in nearly two years.\u201d Facts first: Both of these claims are false. Although Trump oversaw a deal with the Taliban aimed at the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the war did not end under his presidency. The last US troops left Afghanistan in August 2021 under the Biden administration. Moreover, there is no period of \u201cnearly two years\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency where no American service member was killed. During his four years in office, there were 45 US service member hostile deaths, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System. The longest stretch without combat deaths was at the end of his presidency, from March 2020 until he left office in January 2021 \u2013 less than a year. From CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler Former Trump intel chief misleadingly says \u2018Taliban is back\u2019 Richard Grenell, who served as the acting Director of National Intelligence in 2020, said Wednesday night that under President Joe Biden \u201cthe Taliban is back.\u201d \u201c[A]fter four years of Joe Biden, wars are back, the Taliban is back and members of ISIS have slipped through America\u2019s broken southern border,\u201d Grenell said. Facts first: The claim that the \u201cTaliban is back\u201d is misleading, as\u00a0it insinuates the Taliban ever left.  While it\u2019s true that the Taliban returned to power after the United States\u2019 2021 withdrawal, the Taliban remained present in Afghanistan throughout Trump\u2019s time in office. The US, under the Trump administration, and the Taliban signed a historic agreement in 2020 that set into motion the US\u2019 withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Officials within the Trump administration also met with Taliban representatives \u201crepeatedly\u201d in Doha for nearly a year, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said in a 2019 report. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Peter Navarro\u2019s false claims about his prosecution for contempt of Congress The same day he got out of prison after serving his sentence for contempt of Congress, former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol demanded he break the law. \u201cThey demanded that I break the law because they have no respect for it. I refused,\u201d Navarro told the audience at the Republic National Convention Wednesday, adding that the committee wanted him to betray Trump. Navarro also claimed that special counsel Jack Smith \u201cindicted and prosecuted me.\u201d Facts first: These assertions are both false. While Navarro has long claimed that the information subpoenaed by the committee was protected by executive privilege, the judge presiding over his case found evidence did not show that Trump had formally asserted the privilege. And Smith did not prosecute Navarro; the US attorney in Washington, DC, did. In a ruling last summer, prior to his trial where a jury convicted Navarro of being in contempt of Congress, US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Navarro could not argue that Trump asserted executive privilege to shield him from the congressional subpoena. Mehta concluded that either Trump himself or someone authorized to assert privilege or immunity on his behalf would have had to personally invoke the privilege for it to be validly asserted. The judge said Navarro had not put forward adequate evidence to show such an assertion when he was subpoenaed for testimony and documents by the House committee in February 2022. A jury in Washington, DC, found that Navarro broke the law in refusing to comply with Congress, not the other way around as the former adviser suggested. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand Florida Republican\u2019s false claim about electric tanks Florida Rep. Mike Waltz said Wednesday that Biden is \u201cfocused on building electric tanks.\u201d \u201cWhat do we have today with President Biden? What\u2019s he focused on? \u2026 here\u2019s my favorite, he\u2019s focused on building electric tanks. Has anyone seen any charging stations in the Middle East for Biden\u2019s electric tanks?\u201d Facts first: The claim that Biden is focused on building electric tanks is false.  The Army released a climate strategy in 2022 that called for a move toward various kinds of electric vehicles, including \u201cfully electric tactical vehicles by 2050,\u201d but that would not include tanks. And, regardless, a strategy is not a mandate. An engineer with the RAND Corporation told FactCheck.org of similar claims made by Trump regarding electric tanks in the military: \u201cWhile it may be true that an electric tank would have limited range, the Army is not planning on fielding or deploying an electric tank, though there have been prototypes of\u00a0hybrid tanks.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Florida lawmaker\u2019s claim about extremism training in the military Florida Rep. Brian Mast claimed at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that the Biden administration has distracted the military \u201cwith millions of hours of so-called extremism training.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have once again weakened our armed forces and \u2026distracted our troops with millions of hours of so-called extremism training,\u201d Mast said. Facts first: The claim that the US military has \u201cmillions of hours\u201d of extremism training is false.  While there has been training in the military on extremism, it is not millions of hours\u2019 worth. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered units in 2021 to hold a one-day \u201cstand down\u201d to discuss extremism in the military. The undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness said in a 2022 memo that \u201cdiscussions about extremist activity\u201d would be included in \u201cperiodic training.\u201d But the Biden administration has also shown an unwillingness to require more training on extremism in the military. In 2021, the White House said that while the administration \u201cshares the goal of preventing prohibited extremist activities and holding offenders accountable,\u201d it would not support the establishment of an Office of Countering Extremism in the Pentagon \u201cbecause it would impose onerous and overly specific training.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Burgum claims Biden has waged a \u2018war on energy\u2019 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum claimed Wednesday night as he addressed the Republican National Convention that Biden has waged a \u201cwar on energy.\u201d Facts First: This claim needs context. Biden has stressed the importance of renewable energy during his administration, but the US under Biden is producing more crude oil than any country ever has. The world record was set by the US in 2023, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, averaging about 12.9 million barrels per day \u2013 exceeding the Trump-era record, an average of about 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019. US production of dry natural gas also hit a new high in 2023.\u00a0So did US crude oil exports. CNN\u2019s Matt Egan reported in December that the US was exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia were producing, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. None of this is to say that Biden is the reason that domestic oil production has increased; market factors are the key driver of companies\u2019 investment and production decisions, and the Energy Information Administration has credited technological improvements in fracking and horizontal drilling technology that have made oil wells more productive. Egan reported in August: \u201cThe American Petroleum Institute, an oil trade group that has been critical of the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory efforts, noted that approved federal permits and new federal acres leased have both fallen sharply under Biden.\u201d Still, despite Biden\u2019s often-critical rhetoric about fossil fuel companies, some policy moves to get tougher on those companies and his major investments in initiatives to fight climate change, he certainly has not come close to stopping fossil fuel production as Trump has claimed. Biden has also approved some significant and controversial fossil fuel projects, including the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Ronny Jackson\u2019s false claim of \u2018record-high inflation\u2019 Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas claimed in his Republican National Convention speech on Wednesday that there has been \u201crecord-high inflation\u201d under the Biden administration. Facts First: This is false. The record for US inflation, set in 1920, is 23.7%; the Biden-era peak was 9.1% in June 2022. Jackson could fairly say there was a four-decade high under Biden \u2013 that June 2022 figure was the highest since late 1981 \u2013 but there was nothing close to a new record. In addition, Jackson didn\u2019t mention that inflation has fallen sharply since the Biden-era peak two years ago. The current inflation rate, for June 2024, is 3%. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Mike Waltz\u2019s false claim about spy balloons Republican Rep. Mike Waltz said Wednesday that there were no spy balloon incidents during the Trump administration, like the Chinese spy balloon that transited over the continental US in 2023 before being shot down over the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cWe had a president who defeated ISIS, broke Iran, stood with Israel, always stood with our allies, made China pay. You didn\u2019t see any spy balloons under President Trump, did you?\u201d Waltz said. Facts first: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.  Three suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d allowed the balloons to travel undetected. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about Russia\u2019s nuclear missiles near Cuba Whatley claimed in his opening speech on Wednesday evening that Russia has \u201cparked a nuclear missile capable boat\u201d in Cuba. \u201cWhere are we today? Russia has invaded Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve parked a nuclear missile capable boat 90 miles off our shore in Havana, Cuba.\u201d Facts first: This claim about the status of a Russian boat is false. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left.  A group of four Russian Navy vessels arrived in Cuba on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, was the first of the vessels to leave Havana on June 17. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC video falsely claims there was peace in the Middle East under Trump A video played early in the Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday night claimed that the \u201cstrength\u201d of Trump kept \u201cthe Middle East at peace.\u201d Whatley had similarly claimed in his convention speech on Monday that the Middle East was \u201cat peace\u201d four years ago under Trump. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there was peace in the Middle East under Trump is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Miller called \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites right-wing think tank without mentioning it was doing so A video played at the beginning of Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday evening attacked Biden\u2019s handling of foreign policy \u2013 and featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Defense News reports today that the US military is in decline and threats from China are formidable.\u201d Facts First: This claim is misleading. Defense News, an independent publication covering national security, did not itself assert that the US military is in decline. Rather, the publication reported that the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank had made that assertion. A Defense News article in October 2022 was headlined, \u201cUS military in decline, threats from China \u2018formidable,\u2019 report says.\u201d\u00a0The article explained that these assertions came from \u201ca new\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that each year analyzes the strength of the armed forces and the threats to America.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_democrats-dnc-process-nominee", "text": "The Democratic National Committee is moving forward with a process that will determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee by August 7, party officials said Monday night, shortly before Kamala Harris secured enough delegate endorsements to win the Democratic nomination. The party\u2019s decision to move forward with a remote voting process came just a day after President Joe Biden\u2019s stunning announcement to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Harris. The vice president has now been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates she\u2019ll need to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate. \u201cWhile this situation is unprecedented, the process we are prepared to undertake is not,\u201d Democratic National Convention Chair Minyon Moore said Monday. \u201cWe have important deadlines to meet. We will make sure the process is fair, because, as it stands, no candidate has secured a majority of the delegates to the convention.\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison also pledged to the party being \u201ccommitted to an open and fair nominating process\u201d that \u201creflects the dedication to democracy our party stands for.\u201d According to DNC officials and a document obtained by CNN, candidates will need to declare their interest in becoming the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president by filing a formal\u00a0declaration\u00a0of candidacy,\u00a0meeting\u00a0party and legal qualifications to be president, and\u00a0gathering\u00a0at least 300 delegate signatures, with no more than 50 from a single state. The window of time for candidates to declare their interest will be short, one DNC official said, and would end by this week. Under the proposal, the DNC will share with delegates a candidate directory, which will include names and contact information for candidates to allow delegates to opt into information from campaigns. However, while the DNC intends to have a Democratic nominee chosen by August 7, exactly when virtual voting would begin has yet to be determined and would depend on factors like how many candidates are ultimately able to obtain support from the necessary 300 delegates. If only one candidate were to reach that threshold, for example, the party could move more quickly to begin the virtual voting process, the official said. If multiple candidates qualify, there would be a period of a few days for candidates to make their case to delegates. A date for the start of the virtual voting process, therefore, has not yet been set, but it could be as early as August 1. The DNC has long made clear that it is committed to locking in its nominee before the convention begins \u2013 and specifically before August 7, which, it says, is critical to ensure ballot access in all states and avoid the risk of litigation. The party will hold its in-person convention in Chicago from August 19 to 22. Party officials were less specific about the timing of the vice presidential nomination, saying that while they would give the future nominee the ability to finalize the choice by August 7, the exact schedule would be up to the candidate. The rules will allow for candidates to file the necessary paperwork and to gather the signatures electronically. Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, chair of the DNC rules committee, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d on Monday night that the idea boils down to: \u201cAnybody\u2019s welcome to come in.\u201d \u201cIt is an open process; anyone is welcome,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThe delegates who were selected\u00a0will cast their vote as they\u00a0see fit, and we will come out\u00a0with a nominee in\u00a0time\u201d to get on the ballot in all 50 states, the governor, who has\u00a0endorsed Harris, said. To win the nomination, a candidate will need the support of a majority of pledged delegates to the convention \u2013 1,976 out of 3,949 pledged delegates, party officials said. The endorsements are not binding, and with Biden out of the race, delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice. However, Harris is backed by well more than the number needed. While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates \u2013 senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their position \u2013 will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full convention. That could be determined either by a candidate winning enough votes during remote balloting, or by gathering that many signatures. The convention rules committee will vote Wednesday on the proposed rules, a Democratic official said. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_biden-ambition-democracy-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden ran for reelection to save democracy. In the end, he came to the shattering realization he could only do so by ceding power himself. Biden reached the decision to end his campaign after days in isolation at his Delaware beach house with Covid-19 and after watching many Democrats desert the president who led them to power just four years ago. In offering to hand over power in service of what he saw as the national interest, he struck a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who fought bitterly against leaving office after losing a free and fair election to Biden in 2020. It\u2019s ironic that Republicans who whitewashed Trump\u2019s election-stealing effort are now accusing Democrats of crushing the will of primary voters who voted for the president\u2019s reelection bid. \u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\u201d Biden said in a letter he posted to X on Sunday afternoon. \u201cAnd while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, but his late-in-the campaign decision sets off a potentially chaotic and divisive rush to rally behind a Democratic nominee in the month before the party convention in Chicago and less than four months before the election. The Biden campaign effectively ended in the 20 first, faltering minutes of his debate against Trump last month, when the president looked confused, exhausted and was unable to take the attack to his foe or to make an effective case for himself. His struggles validated concerns of majorities of voters that he would be too old for a second term that would have ended when he is 86. His fervent efforts to save his campaign in television interviews and campaign appearances only exacerbated the concerns about his showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta. Three weeks of severe erosion in his political position saw a daily drip of defections from Democratic lawmakers, while party grandees like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed from behind the scenes. The drying up of donor cash also seemed to make Biden\u2019s campaign unsustainable. Even if he wanted to go on, it became clear that he couldn\u2019t. Still Biden, proud and defiant, resisted every effort to push him out of the race, insisting, along with his loyal inner core of staff, that there was no other Democrat better qualified or more likely to beat Trump, whom the president views as an existential threat to American democracy and the country\u2019s soul. But in the end, Biden could not find a way to make voters unsee the poignant picture of an 81-year-old commander in chief who appeared to have seriously declined and was stumbling in the debate. Legislative record overshadowed by inflation Biden\u2019s impressive legislative record, which bears comparison with any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson, was one of the reasons why he resisted attempts to push him out of the race, saying he wanted to finish the job. Becoming the oldest president ever elected, he was 78 when he took office. Biden declared in his inaugural address that the American political system of checks and balances had held and triumphed over Trump\u2019s election lies \u2013 not knowing at the time that the ex-president\u2019s threat to democracy would only grow. The new president immediately set about tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst public health emergency in 100 years, which had been exacerbated by Trump\u2019s mismanagement and politicization of his own government\u2019s public health guidelines. Biden enacted a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package that the White House credited with helping to drive unemployment to near 50-year lows and spurring a faster rebound for the US economy than for other developed nations. Biden also passed a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act and a bipartisan infrastructure package that had eluded other recent presidents. But Biden badly underestimated the threat from inflation, which rose to 40-year-highs. While the cost of living has eased, many Americans are still feeling the punishing blowback from high grocery prices and elevated interest rates \u2013 which offered Trump an opening. Overseas, Biden responded forcibly to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, becoming the most important leader of the West since the end of the Cold War with his efforts to reinvigorate NATO. But the chaotic US exit from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 hurt Biden\u2019s self-proclaimed status as a foreign policy expert, and his handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza damaged his standing with parts of his base. A painful decision for a president who abandoned two previous campaigns The soul searching that Biden endured led to a decision that in some ways represents a humiliating end for a politician who spent years pursuing the highest office and was frequently passed over in his climb to power. It is not an easy thing for a president \u2014 the most powerful person in the world \u2014 to separate his personal ambition from the fate of the nation. And the debilitating distancing that took place between top Democrats and Biden in recent weeks was a cruel lesson in the brutality of politics, given that the president had ejected Trump from power after the most tumultuous presidency in modern times. It must be an especially bitter pill for Biden that he will not be able to take the fight to Trump, who has spent the last three years saying he was too infirm and mentally diminished to effectively serve as president. The ignominy of being effectively forced to shelve his reelection bid will also be painful for the president since he\u2019s had to abandon two White House campaigns before \u2014 in 1987 after he was caught plagiarizing a British politician and in 2008 after he failed to gain traction in a blockbuster race that was dominated by Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. Sunday\u2019s denouement was also the latest harrowing turn in a life of tragedy that saw Biden lose his first wife and infant daughter to a car crash when he\u2019d been elected to the Senate from Delaware. He had to bury another child in 2015 when his beloved son Beau died of brain cancer. And in recent years, the president has been dealing with the pressure and pain of helping his other son Hunter through the horror of addiction and a personal crisis that culminated in a criminal conviction on a gun charge earlier this year. Given his political and personal history, it was no surprise that Biden would dig in his heels as calls mounted from within the Democratic Party for him to quit the race. But the growing possibility that his legacy would be remembered not for ousting the most aberrant president in modern American history but for paving the way for an even more extreme second Trump term, set in motion the political forces that would extinguish his hopes. If Biden\u2019s gamble pays off and another Democratic candidate beats Trump, he may go down in history as one of the most successful one-term presidents in history. He will have enabled such a triumph by putting his own ambition on hold for the good of his party and the country. But his late exit will raise questions over whether he has saddled his party \u2014 and a Democratic successor \u2014 with an impossible task in standing up a campaign in a matter of days against a united Republican Party that emerged from its convention in Milwaukee last week convinced it was on a path to victory. Seeking a second term at the age of 81 turned out to be an impossible mission \u2014 and, despite his efforts, Biden may have saved his party huge problems had he reached the same conclusion before the primary season started. If history is a guide, Biden\u2019s rock bottom approval ratings will spike in the coming days. When Johnson announced he would not run for a second term in his own right in 1968, he was greeted by massive crowds in subsequent public events around the country. Johnson made his move in March, during the primary campaign, and his departure set off a chaotic chain of events, worsened by the assassination of Democratic primary candidate Robert F. Kennedy, and a violence-plagued convention in Chicago \u2014 which will also host this year\u2019s event. In the end, the eventual Democratic nominee, then-Vice Pre\ufeffsident Hubert Humphrey, lost to Republican Richard Nixon. Years earlier, in March 1952, Harry S. Truman, another Democratic president, had decided not to seek his own second term. The Democratic nominee that year, Adlai Stevenson, lost to Republican Dwight Eisenhower. But if Biden does enjoy a burst of support for his selflessness \u2013 and even nostalgia for the successes of what is now a lame duck presidency \u2013 it might not translate to his successor. No modern president has ever bowed out of the presidential race at such a late date. And Harris, or whoever picks up the baton, now faces one of the most daunting missions in electoral history, against an opponent who has already proved there is nothing he will not do to win.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-ambition-democracy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_kfile-jd-vance-believed-donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-2016", "text": "Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, repeatedly indicated in 2016 that he believed Donald Trump had committed sexual assault, even suggesting in one TV segment that in a \u201che said, she said\u201d situation Trump was less credible than one of his accusers. Vance appeared on a MSNBC segment in October 2016 on Trump\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct in which an interview with Jessica Leeds, a former salesperson who accused\u00a0 Trump of groping and forcibly kissing her during a flight in the 1970s, was played. Vance said it was hard to believe Trump\u2019s denials over Leeds. \u201cAt a fundamental level, this is sort of a \u2018he said, she said,\u2019 right? And at the end of the day, do you believe Donald Trump, who always tells the truth? Just kidding,\u201d said Vance sarcastically. \u201cOr do you believe that woman on that tape?\u201d he said, referring to Leeds. But by May 2023, in a sign of his shift on Trump from open critic to fiercely loyal surrogate, Vance\u2019s position changed entirely while invoking similar language: Vance said he believed his \u201cfriend\u201d Trump, just after the former president was found liable by a jury for sexual abuse against author E. Jean Carroll. \u201cI think fundamentally the lawsuit is about something that happened 25 years ago. It\u2019s a \u2018he said, she said\u2019 situation. And I trust my friend and the guy that I\u2019ve known and gotten to know,\u201d the Ohio Republican told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, about six months after winning his US Senate race with Trump\u2019s endorsement. Vance then suggested that the lawsuit, and the people funding it, was not about justice but about politics. \u201cThey are trying to take him down for political reasons. That, to me, is not about justice, that\u2019s not about discovering the truth. That\u2019s about using the legal system instead of the political system to win a debate against Donald Trump.\u201d A spokesperson for Vance told CNN, \u201cJD\u2019s tweets and comments about President Trump from nearly a decade ago are old news that have been addressed numerous times since he entered the political world. They don\u2019t reflect his views on President Trump today and haven\u2019t for many years.\u201d Trump has repeatedly denied claims of sexual assault. Repeatedly indicated he thought Trump committed sexual assault Vance\u2019s defense of Trump marked a striking shift from his remarks in 2016 in the wake of the leak of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, which showed the Republican presidential candidate making lewd and sexually aggressive remarks about women. In October 2016, Vance tweeted, \u201cWhat percentage of the American population has @realDonaldTrump sexually assaulted?\u201d The tweet, which was first reported in 2018, was later deleted, but its replies still exist on the platform, and the tweet was later compiled in an opposition report published by his own super PAC in 2022 to uncover his potential vulnerabilities as a candidate. In deleted likes from his Twitter account, reviewed by CNN, Vance had also indicated he believed Trump\u2019s accusers and those who criticized Trump as a \u201cserial sexual assault[er].\u201d \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d read the post, again posted just after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced. Another post liked in 2016 by Vance said, \u201cI wish there was a 2nd Vice Presidential debate just to see @GovPenceIN deny that Trump said he grabbed p*ssy.\u201d And in October 2016, Vance shared on Facebook a Washington Post editorial by Russell Moore, then of the Southern Baptist Convention, criticizing Trump\u2019s views on women.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/kfile-jd-vance-believed-donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-2016/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_house-gop-campaign-arm-harris-strategy", "text": "The House Republican campaign arm is developing a targeted plan of attack to pin specific pieces of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 record against Democrats running in competitive House races as Harris marches toward the Democratic nomination. The framing of GOP attacks on down-ballot Democrats are starting to take shape even though Harris is still not officially the Democratic presidential nominee, as the GOP campaign arm looks to quickly adjust their message and maintain their goal of keeping control of the House. The plan, which is still evolving, is to continue to tie Harris to what they see as failed policies of the Biden administration while also resurfacing some of her positions from her 2019 presidential run. \u201cIt\u2019s the Harris-Biden ticket,\u201d GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas told CNN. \u201cHis failures are her failures.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean GOP lawmakers are necessarily going to stay on message. GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee referred to Harris as a \u201cDEI hire,\u201d as she is on the path to becoming the first woman of color nominated for president by a major party, which many of his colleagues echoed. Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steve\u00a0Horsford\u00a0said that Burchett\u2019s remarks were \u201cinappropriate, offensive, and really disgusting.\u201d Behind closed doors,\u00a0House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday\u00a0also addressed the\u00a0attacks\u00a0some Republicans have made on the vice president\u2019s race and implored the conference to stay on message. \u201cListen, this election, as I noted at the outset, is going to be about policies, not personalities,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is not personal. With regard to Kamala Harris and her ethnicity, or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\u201d Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida also appealed to the House GOP to keep focus on Harris\u2019 policies, according to an attendee, a sign of how many Republicans are uneasy about the attacks over her race. The National Republican Congressional Committee also put out a separate memo to candidates encouraging members to be specific in their messaging. \u201cDO NOT: Waste time talking about anything other than what Harris WOULD DO as President,\u201d the memo reads. The memo also acknowledges the challenges of Republicans having to quickly change their message to address Harris when they had built their whole strategy around attacking President Joe Biden for his age and his family\u2019s foreign business dealings, on top of his policies. \u201cRepublicans have never had less time to define the presidential nominee of our opponents,\u201d the memo stated. \u201cBecause of that, it is vital that our entire Conference is on message and working together to present Kamala Harris as an extreme San Francisco progressive who is out of step with the American people.\u201d As GOP lawmakers may struggle with their message, the GOP campaign arm has been trying out specific targets. In key swing districts in Arizona and New Mexico, the GOP campaign arm plans to hammer home Harris\u2019 efforts to tackle root causes of migration from Central America as Republicans look to make border crossings and mass migrations a top campaign issue. Republicans have long dubbed Harris the \u201cborder czar,\u201d and one GOP strategist said to expect Republicans to tie down-ballot Democrats to that title even more. \u201cThe unique problem with picking her is she can\u2019t run away from any of that,\u201d GOP Rep. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota told CNN. The White House has rejected the \u201cborder czar\u201d title, arguing that her focus was on long-term fixes. In a key vote in February, Senate Republicans blocked a\u00a0major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package\u00a0with assistance for Ukraine and Israel amid a torrent of attacks on the bill by former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar on Tuesday called efforts by House Republicans to paint Harris as a \u201cborder czar\u201d during the Biden administration \u201claughable and unserious.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear, there was no \u2018border czar.\u2019 Kamala Harris\u2019 role was to engage in multilateral discussion with our Latin American countries,\u201d the House Democratic Caucus chair told reporters. Beyond her assignment on the border from the White House, Republicans have also resurfaced the moment from a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2019 where Harris raised her hand when candidates were asked if they were\u00a0in favor of decriminalizing illegal border crossing, and sent out a clip of her appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d shortly after where she tried to clean up her position but appeared to further contradict herself. After the Democrat running in southern Arizona\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris, the NRCC released a statement calling Harris the border czar with a\u00a0link\u00a0to a portion of Harris\u2019 2019 interview with \u201cThe View.\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement to CNN, \u201cVice President Kamala Harris has held criminals accountable her entire career \u2013 and Donald Trump will be no different. Vice President Harris has dedicated her career to making life better for working people \u2013 while Trump only cares about himself. That\u2019s the contrast the American people will see over the next 106 days.\u201d In Pennsylvania, the GOP campaign arm is focusing on Harris\u2019 previous statements as a presidential candidate in 2019 about banning fracking. The campaign group has been publicizing comments Harris made during a CNN town hall in 2019 in the districts of Democratic Reps. Matt Cartwright and Susan Wild specifically. And in states like Minnesota and Oregon, the NRCC is framing Harris as soft on crime, by tying Democrats in those districts to a 2020\u00a0tweet\u00a0where she solicited money for a charitable bail group in the wake of the May 2020 police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis that led to protests across the country. Both Biden and Harris have condemned the riots and violence that occurred on multiple occasions and have expressed support for peaceful protest. The NRCC is already working on developing flushed out ads, but their initial attacks on vulnerable House Democrats provide a window into the strategy that is developing behind the scenes at a rapid clip. \u201cThe thing about this race is that both Harris and Trump have held office,\u201d Johnson, the House speaker, told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ve been these two competing administrations that you can, you can sit side by side, and people are asking themselves, \u2018How was I doing during the Trump administration, and how am I doing now?\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I think the answer is clear for a lot of people, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re gonna have a good November and I really like our chances with her at the top particularly,\u201d Johnson added.

The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left. An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris\u2019 aide cited a previously scheduled event\u00a0as the reason\u00a0for missing the speech Wednesday. A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden\u2019s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris\u2019 first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris\u2019 candidacy. Harris is expected to \u201ccontinue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,\u201d the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. \u201cWe anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,\u201d according to the aide. \u201cAnd they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.\u201d On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority\u2019s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters. \u201cHer travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,\u201d the aide said. Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu\u2019s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu\u2019s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN. Netanyahu\u00a0landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a\u00a0post by an Israeli Embassy official on X. He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza \u2013 including Americans \u2013\u00a0on Monday evening. Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president. This story has been updated with additional details.

While endorsements from delegates continue to come in, the vice president has now been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates she\u2019ll need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Harris crossed the threshold amid a wave of endorsements from state delegations Monday evening. These endorsements are not binding and with President Joe Biden out of the race, delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice. CNN\u2019s count comes from public statements of support from delegates and state delegations, CNN reporting and conversations with delegates. Endorsements from state delegations are counted as unanimous support for Harris absent other information. \u201cTonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party\u2019s nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state\u2019s delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon,\u201d Harris said in a statement from her campaign late Monday. Under a plan outlined by Democratic officials Monday, delegates are expected to vote virtually to confirm Harris as the nominee by August 7. The Democratic National Committee has long made clear that it is committed to locking in its nominee before the in-person convention begins on August 19 \u2013 and specifically before August 7, which, it says, is critical to ensure ballot access in all states and avoid the risk of litigation. While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates \u2013 senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their position \u2013 will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full convention. That could be determined either by a candidate winning enough votes during remote balloting, or by gathering that many signatures. Harris, who will hold a campaign event in Milwaukee on Tuesday, visited the campaign\u2019s headquarters in Delaware earlier Monday. She delivered a speech to staff, previewing her campaign argument against former President Donald Trump and detailing her experience as an attorney general and prosecutor. The vice president said in her statement Monday that she will continue to travel across the country in the coming months \u201ctalking to Americans about everything that is on the line.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_vice-presidents-kamala-harris-what-matters", "text": "The ascension of Vice President Kamala Harris to become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in less than 48 hours is an unprecedented occurrence in American politics. Her victory in November, if it happens, would also be an extremely rare event. Only four people in US history have won a presidential election as a sitting vice president. Two of those races, from more than 200 years ago, featured Founding Fathers running in a different election system. Back then, the vice president was the runner-up in the presidential election. The bitter elections of 1796, which was won by John Adams, and 1800, which ended in a tie and was decided when the House of Representatives picked Thomas Jefferson, led to the adoption of the 12th Amendment, after which electors voted for president and vice president as separate positions. A few decades later, in 1836, Vice President Martin Van Buren, who was known as the \u201cLittle Magician\u201d for his short stature, won the race to succeed two-term populist President Andrew Jackson. Van Buren was the first president born after the Declaration of Independence. Bank failures and a financial collapse marred his presidency, and Van Buren lost his bid for reelection in 1840 and also failed in an attempted comeback with a third party years later. And that was it for nearly 150 years. Vice presidents became president after the death of multiple presidents and the resignation of one, but no other person won the White House from the vice presidency until 1988, with George H.W. Bush, who succeeded two-term President Ronald Reagan. The current president, Joe Biden, was vice president under Barack Obama, but he did not run to succeed Obama \u2013 which we\u2019re learning created some frustration on Biden\u2019s part when Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in 2016. If Harris loses this year, she will have to endure one of the most humbling experiences in US politics, overseeing the counting of electoral votes in her role as vice president for a presidential election she lost. Three other vice presidents have endured this indignity, all in extremely contentious circumstances. In 1861, Vice President John Breckinridge oversaw the counting of electoral votes that made Abraham Lincoln president, at a time when Southern states seceded from the country rather than accept Lincoln\u2019s 1860 victory. Vice President Richard Nixon narrowly lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy and oversaw the counting of electoral votes in 1961. Nixon would return to victory eight years later. Vice President Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election in 2000 after a controversial Supreme Court decision, and he oversaw the counting of electoral votes in 2001 that made Bush\u2019s son, George W. Bush, president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/vice-presidents-kamala-harris-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_pennsylvania-state-police-commissioner-reveals-stunning-info-about-trump-shooting", "text": "A local law enforcement commissioner revealed during a House Homeland Security hearing on Tuesday stunning new details about the security failures that led to the near assassination of Donald Trump, raising more questions for the embattled US Secret Service. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris\u2019 striking testimony comes just one day after now-resigned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testified before the House Oversight Committee and largely declined to answer questions about the shooting\u00a0at the former president\u2019s Pennsylvania rally. Paris told lawmakers about the communications between the Secret Service and local law enforcement who initially spotted Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin. He also described a more detailed timeline from when officers first spotted Crooks in the crowd to when the 20-year-old opened fire on Trump. Here\u2019s what to know from Tuesday\u2019s hearing: Officers left post to look for Crooks Two local law enforcement officers left a building with vantage points overlooking the roof where Crooks took aim at the former president before he fired shots, Paris testified. Paris said that two officers with the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, a tactical force with sniper capabilities, left their posts in the building to look for a suspicious individual they spotted first and alerted to other law enforcement. That person was Crooks. The lawmakers watched video taken during a congressional tour of the rally site Monday, from the building where the ESU officers left their post, showing the roof where Crooks eventually climbed and took shots at Trump. \u201cSo are you then saying, to your knowledge, those ESU officers left the location where they could look out the window to go in search of this person?\u201d Republican Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina asked. \u201cThat is my understanding,\u201d Paris said, adding that the officers went searching with other local officers in the area. \u201cI don\u2019t want to establish a timeline minute by minute because we don\u2019t have that yet.\u201d Bishop also questioned whether the two officers who left their post could have seen Crooks climb on top of the roof if they had stayed put. Paris said he didn\u2019t know. Crooks fired eight times Investigators believe that Crooks fired eight rounds before he was killed by counter-snipers, Paris said. \u201cI believe that the number is eight,\u201d Paris told the committee. \u201cEight casings have been recovered.\u201d Officials had previously only confirmed that the shooter fired multiple times at the rally earlier this month. Paris also told members of Congress that \u201cseveral Secret Service agents\u201d told the state police area commander during a walkthrough of the area before the rally that the Butler County Emergency Services Unit was responsible for securing the building where Crooks fired the shots. Minutes on the roof A municipal officer came face-to-face with Crooks during the several minutes the would-be assassin was on the roof before Crooks fired on Trump, Paris testified. Paris said that the brief confrontation came as a pair of local officers who had learned of Crooks\u2019 position on the roof attempted to climb up and confront the shooter. But while the officer was \u201cdangling\u201d from the roof, Crooks aimed his rifle at the officer and the officer fell. Paris told lawmakers that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes, correcting a shorter timeframe he gave earlier, but only a few seconds passed between when the officer confronted him and when he fired at Trump \u201cWhen the one local officer hoisted the other one up, and subsequently falls,\u201d Paris said, Crooks was \u201calready, I believe, close to being in his final position there. And I\u2019m told it\u2019s \u2013 again, sequence of events, not a timeline based on the prior criteria laid out \u2013 but seconds after that is when the first shots rang up.\u201d Paris\u00a0said\u00a0that whether, or when, the confrontation was relayed to the Secret Service or other law enforcement agencies at the rally \u201cremains under investigation.\u201d Communications between Secret Service and local law enforcement Paris also detailed communications among law enforcement about Crooks before Trump took the stage at the rally earlier this month. According to Paris, \u201cthere was a text thread going\u201d with members of the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, some of whom initially spotted Crooks and reported him as a suspicious individual. \u201cAt some point when he utilized the range finder, the suspicion was heightened,\u201d Paris said of Crooks. State Police then received a call and a text from the ESU about Crooks\u2019 activity that they immediately relayed to Secret Service. Local, state and federal law enforcement were in a unified command post at the rally. State Police \u201cverbally turned right around and gave it to the Secret Service,\u201d Paris said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/pennsylvania-state-police-commissioner-reveals-stunning-info-about-trump-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision not to run for reelection creates a unique situation for Democrats and Democratic voters in which the person who won party primaries is no longer the party\u2019s candidate. Biden won the pledge of nearly every delegate during the primary process, when voters chose him as their nominee. Under party rules, now those delegates are free to choose someone else. That someone is expected to be Vice President Kamala Harris, who first got Biden\u2019s endorsement on Sunday, and around whom other Democrats have rallied.\u00a0A majority of Democrats to the Democratic National Convention have now endorsed Harris. As\u00a0we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February, these individual delegates\u00a0will now select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, likely, during a\u00a0virtual roll call before the convention gets underway). These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign.\u00a0So it will\u00a0largely be Biden backers who will be\u00a0picking his replacement. Biden\u2019s delegates can now back Harris Now that Biden is no longer a candidate, his delegates are free to vote for whomever they\u2019d like. He doesn\u2019t need to formally \u201crelease\u201d his delegates. But Biden, in a post on X announcing he was leaving the race, also endorsed Harris. Democrats have overwhelmingly followed his lead. As of Monday evening, Harris had the support of enough Democratic delegates to win the party\u2019s nomination, according to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate, although the endorsements are not binding. But all of the Democrats \u2013 governors and senators \u2013 who have been mentioned as likely future presidential candidates are among those who have endorsed Harris. When will this be official? Rather than engage in a divisive fight, the party is rallying around Biden\u2019s No. 2, and they\u2019re looking to do it quickly. The Democratic Party is moving forward with a process that will determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee by August 7, weeks before the convention gets underway, party officials said Monday night. Could other candidates still get into the race? According to DNC officials and a document obtained by CNN, candidates will need to declare their interest in becoming the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president by filing a formal\u00a0declaration\u00a0of candidacy,\u00a0meeting\u00a0party and legal qualifications to be president, and\u00a0gathering\u00a0at least 300 delegate signatures from convention delegates, with no more than 50 from a single state. The window of time for candidates to declare their interest will be short, one DNC official said, and would end by this week. Under the proposal, the DNC will share with delegates a candidate directory, which will include names and contact information for candidates to allow delegates to opt into information from campaigns. How does the nomination vote work? While the DNC intends to have a Democratic nominee chosen by August 7, exactly when virtual voting would begin has yet to be determined and would depend on factors like how many candidates are ultimately able to obtain support from the necessary 300 delegates. A date for the start of the virtual voting process, therefore, has not yet been set, but it could be as early as August 1. To win the nomination, a candidate will have to have the support of a majority of pledged delegates to the convention \u2013 1,976 out of 3,949 pledged delegates, party officials said. While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates \u2013 roughly 750 senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their position \u2013 will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full convention. That could be determined either by a candidate winning enough votes during remote balloting, or by gathering that many signatures. The number of superdelegates can also shift if one dies or resigns. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the longtime Texas congresswoman, died on July 19, reducing the number of superdelegates by one, bringing the official number to 746. The convention rules committee will vote Wednesday on the proposed rules, a Democratic official said. How does the candidate for vice president get determined? Harris will select a running mate. In practice, there is typically not a roll call vote for vice president, with the presidential nominee\u2019s choice for the position typically nominated by acclamation. Party officials were less specific Monday about the timing of the vice presidential nomination, saying that while they would give the future nominee the ability to finalize the choice by August 7, the exact schedule would be up to the candidate. In 2020, when the party used a similar virtual roll call during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Democratic process functionally allowed the winning candidate for president (Biden) to nominate the vice presidential candidate (Harris) without the need for an additional roll call. Will the Democratic nominee have any trouble getting on the ballot? House Speaker Mike Johnson has complained about this process and said Republicans might file lawsuits in certain states. He has not gotten into specifics. But after the convention nominates a candidate, many election law experts say they won\u2019t have much or any trouble getting on all 51 presidential ballots. Unlike independent candidates, the Democratic and Republican nominees for president don\u2019t need to gather signatures to appear on the ballot. Instead, the major parties, by virtue of their popularity, enjoy automatic ballot access in every state. While the process varies by state, the parties typically submit their nominees\u2019 names (and the names of candidates for presidential elector) to the state. Biden hasn\u2019t been officially nominated and the party hasn\u2019t submitted his name to state officials. So the new nominee wouldn\u2019t be, in an official sense,\u00a0replacing\u00a0Biden. Whoever the delegates select will be the Democratic nominee and they\u00a0shouldn\u2019t have an issue\u00a0taking the Democratic ballot line. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there wouldn\u2019t be the possibility of litigation, even if it would be unlikely to succeed.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_bob-menendez-announces-resignation", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey will resign his seat effective August 20, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by CNN. In July, Menendez was convicted of 16 counts \u2014 including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent \u2014 for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme. Tuesday\u2019s developments mark a major moment in the New Jersey senator\u2019s dramatic political downfall and will bring an end to his scandal-plagued tenure in the Senate. Menendez had faced mounting pressure from within his own party to resign or face the threat of expulsion from the Senate. Receipt\u00a0of Menendez\u2019s resignation letter was announced Tuesday on the Senate floor in a brief exchange between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Presiding Officer Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is expected to appoint a replacement to fill the remainder of Menendez\u2019s term, which ends on January 3, 2025. Democratic Rep. Andy Kim and Republican Curtis Bashaw are set to face off in the November general election for the seat. Menendez, who had been up for reelection this year, had previously filed to run as an independent.\u00a0Menendez did not immediately say whether he still intends to run as an independent. Menendez has represented New Jersey in Congress as a Democrat since being elected in 1992, first as a US representative and then as senator. Menendez, who faces sentencing on October 29, has maintained he never violated his public oath and has said he has never been anything \u201cbut a patriot of my country and for my country.\u201d \u201cObviously, I\u2019m deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury\u2019s decision,\u201d Menendez told reporters outside the courtroom after he was found guilty. \u201cI have every faith that the law and the facts did not sustain that decision and that we will be successful upon appeal.\u201d In the aftermath of the conviction, calls for Menendez to resign grew louder, with Schumer among the voices on Capitol Hill urging the senator to step down. \u201cIn light of this guilty verdict, Senator Menendez must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. Menendez stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year, but had long rejected calls to resign his US Senate seat. Schumer\u00a0told CNN that he will \u201cdefer to the Ethics Committee,\u201d as to whether Menendez can continue to receive classified briefings until his official resignation date. The Senate Ethics Committee announced Monday that they had initiated a review of Menendez\u2019s alleged rules violations. A lengthy legal battle Prosecutors successfully argued that the senator tried to use his power to advance Egyptian military interests, interfere in criminal prosecutions and secure investment from Qatari officials, among other things. Menendez and his wife allegedly received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible and other bribes in exchange for his influence. The senator\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but her trial was postponed indefinitely by the judge after her breast cancer diagnosis. She has pleaded not guilty. The most serious charges of extortion and wire fraud carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison on each count. In all, Menendez faces a maximum of 222 years in prison for the 16 charges if served consecutively. However, any sentences would run concurrently unless the court orders otherwise. Menendez has served in the Senate since 2006 \u2013 and this was not the first time he had faced a legal battle. Menendez was charged by federal prosecutors in 2015 with conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud relating to allegedly abusing the power of his office. At the time, prosecutors said the senator accepted more than $600,000 in political contributions, a luxurious hotel suite at the Park Hyatt in Paris, and free rides on a private jet from a wealthy ophthalmologist, Dr. Salomon Melgen, in exchange for political favors. The corruption trial ended in a mistrial in November 2017 after the jury reported it was deadlocked. Both men denied all of the charges. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_netanyahu-congress-presidents-what-matters", "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu has been weaving in and out of US politics for decades. When the Israeli prime minister addresses a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, it will be his fourth such appearance since 1996, more than any other foreign leader in history and the same number of addresses to Congress a US president gives during one term. Netanyahu has known President Joe Biden for decades, but Biden doubts Netanyahu\u2019s sincerity. The Israeli leader is still trying to regain the trust of former President Donald Trump, who he offended after the 2020 election. Netanyahu earned the undying enmity of former President Barack Obama for trying to tank the Iran nuclear deal. He was close personal friends with Mitt Romney, Obama\u2019s challenger in 2012 and now a US senator, from the time when Romney and Netanyahu worked for the same US-based company in the 1970s. Former President Bill Clinton exploded after his first meeting with Netanyahu in 1996, telling aides, \u201cWho\u2019s the f\u2014- superpower here,\u201d according to the former Middle East negotiator\u00a0Aaron David Miller. In 2015, the last time Netanyahu addressed Congress, it was a rousing and partisan affair, bringing members of Congress to their feet and turning public opinion against the fragile multi-country deal meant to give Iran access to oil money in exchange for controlling its nuclear program. Republican leaders in Congress\u00a0invited Netanyahu\u00a0to deliver the address in 2015, and he used the opportunity to feed a domestic US political split over the Iran nuclear deal. Netanyahu crossed Obama by interfering in US politics on US soil. Then-Vice President Biden, along with 58 members of Congress, skipped the 2015 speech even though Biden was, at the time, president of the US Senate. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stepped up to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president after Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, will not attend Netanyahu\u2019s address on Wednesday, although she is more focused on the campaign trail than Capitol Hill at the moment. Trump turned opposition to the Iran nuclear deal into a major campaign issue in 2016. He pulled the US out of the deal in 2018 but talks about it to this day. Netanyahu had strong ties to the Trump administration, which scuttled the Iran nuclear deal, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem and tried to broker diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab states. But Netanyahu angered Trump when, in 2020, he acknowledged Biden\u2019s electoral win over Trump. \u201cF**k him,\u201d Trump told Axios, speaking about Netanyahu in December 2021. Despite his long relationship with Netanyahu, Biden has criticized the Israeli leader\u2019s government for being too right-wing. Disagreement over the human toll of Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza has split Democrats this year. But for all his criticism of Netanyahu, Biden has continued to provide Israel with weapons and aid, and the two men will meet at the White House. Rather than trying to defeat an international agreement, Netanyahu today needs help from the US. The US is a crucial player in efforts to broker a ceasefire in the Middle East. But CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond writes from Israel that Netanyahu\u2019s motivations are not clear. Yes, his government has taken part in negotiations. But\u00a0Diamond writes: Does Netanyahu actually want a deal? The conventional wisdom in Israeli media, politics and on the streets of Tel Aviv would tell you that the answer to that question is no \u2013 that Netanyahu has much more to gain by prolonging the war and much more to lose by ending it. Even Biden has suggested there\u2019s reason to believe Netanyahu is prolonging the war to stay in power. In addition to meetings with lawmakers and politicians in Washington, Netanyahu also met with American families of hostages held by Hamas. Aviva Siegel, who was formerly held hostage by Hamas and whose husband is still a hostage, did not attend that meeting with Netanyahu on Monday, but she told CNN he must accept a ceasefire deal. \u201cI\u2019m here because the deal is on the table, and he has to, has to take it and not continue the war,\u201d Siegel told CNN in a phone interview from Washington. Netanyahu still has plenty of support in Washington, and you can expect a standing ovation when he speaks to Congress. But Diamond argues \u201chis visit is also an opportunity for top US officials and lawmakers to push, prod, nudge and cajole him toward a deal \u2013 in both public and private.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/netanyahu-congress-presidents-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_kamala-harris-challenges-ahead-analysis", "text": "Kamala Harris has aced her moment. So far. The vice president has already won the backing of enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, sparked a fundraising bonanza and alchemized the mood of a party that looked headed for defeat. But while Harris can hardly have hoped for a better start in establishing legitimacy among Democrats after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection campaign, she is still just hours into a mission that ranks as the most daunting for any modern potential presidential nominee. And the full intensity of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s attacks is yet to unfold in the most unpredictable election season in generations. In a rousing speech Monday afternoon, the vice president rallied campaign staff at their Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters with Biden \u2013 still recovering from Covid-19 \u2013 calling in to solidify the transition. After laying out her prosecutorial case against Trump, Harris cast the contest as \u201ctwo different versions of what we see as the future of our country.\u201d And in her first public event since Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, Harris earlier Monday officiated at an event on the White House lawn centering her in the imagery of the presidency. Perhaps most significantly, she also notched the endorsement of her fellow Californian, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose backdoor maneuvering was critical to ending Biden\u2019s stalled reelection bid and revealed the 84-year-old is still the nation\u2019s most skilled and influential Democrat. After Pelosi said her backing was \u201cofficial, personal and political,\u201d other congressional leaders fell into line behind Harris \u2013 ready to entrust their party\u2019s hopes to a historic standard bearer who is nevertheless an untested leader at the pinnacle of American politics. By Monday evening, the vice president had been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates she\u2019ll need to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to according to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate. And after the freezing of donor cash helped force Biden out of the race, Democratic wallets have opened big-time. Harris raked in more than $100 million between Sunday and Monday evening, a campaign official said, boasting more than 1.1 million unique donors \u2013 62% of them first-time contributors. The vice president\u2019s swift consolidation of power has been impressive. Her multi-hour phone blitz to Democratic Party power players on Sunday hinted at an operation primed ahead of time but that was kept secret and didn\u2019t leak. The plan appears to have strangled any hope of alternative candidates and the aspirations of some in the party for a lightning primary to find a new nominee who could argue that they had won a contested bid for the party banner. Danger signs lurk despite strong start There is an old saying in Washington that a presidential candidate will never have a better day than the one that follows their announcement. The maxim usually applies to the heady first hours of primary campaigns. But Harris, 59, is now playing in the big leagues. Harris must sustain the sudden new momentum in a party that until Sunday believed it was heading to defeat as lawmaker after lawmaker deserted the president following his disastrous debate performance. Even if she succeeds in her plan to \u201cearn and win\u201d the Democratic nomination, Harris will come up against the most feral campaign machine in years. Trump is known for misogynistic and racially charged rhetoric that could turn the next few months into the most searing general election in modern memory. The pressure on Harris from Democrats is also immense. The vice president has shown signs of improving her political skills recently, but that\u2019s never been her forte. This year, party leaders are not just investing in her as the last barrier to a new era of unrestrained conservative rule that could obliterate the achievements of the Biden and Barack Obama presidencies. After replacing Biden as the figurehead of the campaign, Harris is now leading an effort that has as its foundation an attempt to save democracy from Trump. She has just more than 100 days to pull this all off. Trump has seemed momentarily thrown off by the swift shift in Democratic candidates after Biden recognized the unsustainable nature of his bid for a second term that would have ended when he is 86. But there were fresh signs on Monday that Trump\u2019s political operation was readjusting to the new reality and sharpening its attacks against the vice president. In a memo to reporters, the Trump campaign previewed a blistering assault to come on Harris. Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita cast her as the \u201ccopilot\u201d of some of Biden\u2019s most \u201cegregious failures.\u201d They signaled that the vice president\u2019s lack of success in addressing the causes in Latin America of southern border crossings would morph into a narrative that she\u2019s soft on illegal immigration. \u201cShe\u2019s had a lower approval rating than Joe Biden. Harris is the least popular vice president in history \u2013 which is no surprise given her terrible record,\u201d the memo said. \u201cShe makes just as much sense as Joe Biden. By that we mean, none at all.\u201d Harris carves out early success The push by Harris for the Democratic nomination was the latest stunning twist of a race that has defied convention as the oldest president in US history launched a reelection bid and then stepped back at a late hour. The Republican nominee is another unpopular old man who tried to crush US democracy to stay in power after losing the last election. He\u2019s also a convicted felon. No matter, Trump was hailed at last week\u2019s GOP convention as a strongman hero touched by divine providence following an assassination attempt that, along with the debate and the elevation of Harris, represented three of the most momentous events in the history of modern White House campaigns within a four-week span. But something has undeniably shifted. One of the two parties has now given voters what they have told pollsters they want for months \u2014 a choice of a candidate who is not named Biden or Trump. The question now is whether Harris, who has exhibited considerable political liabilities as vice president, has the skills, staying power and luck to take advantage. \u2022 Harris moved swiftly to unify the party behind her, helped by an apparent desire by key power brokers to avoid a divisive fight for the nomination at the convention next month in Chicago. Governors, senators and congressional and state delegations rushed to get on board. The quickening momentum reflects a party desperate to prevent a second Trump term. As Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler put it on Monday after 89 of the Badger State\u2019s 95 delegates pledged support to Harris, there had been a \u201cflowering of unity\u201d after Biden stepped down. \u2022 Democrats could be experiencing a pivot point if Harris\u2019 unique coalition can replace the frayed one that hampered Biden\u2019s electoral hopes. A CNN poll at the end of June showed, for instance, that in a hypothetical matchup against Trump, the vice president outpolled her boss among women voters, political independents and movable voters. Such key voting blocs could be critical to the outcome of the election in the handful of swing states and districts likely to decide the race. \u2022 Signs are growing that Harris\u2019 rise and Biden\u2019s exit have redefined the thematic dimensions of the 2024 race. For months, Democrats have been on the defensive over Biden\u2019s age and claims that he was suffering from cognitive decline. Now, suddenly, they are enjoying a generational transformation with a candidate who is nearly 20 years younger than the 78-year-old Republican nominee. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had tried during her GOP primary campaign to play the age card that the Democrats have now successfully deployed, saying the first party to \u201cretire their 80-year-old\u201d candidate would win the election. Democrats are now gleefully trying to reinforce the impression. \u201cI promise you, you\u2019re never going to hear Donald Trump ask his opponent to take a cognitive test again. And we\u2019ve probably heard the last of that,\u201d Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California told CNN\u2019s John Berman Monday. \u2022 New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu saw this coming. He said at a Politico event at the GOP convention last week, \u201cIf and when they make the switch, everything is going to change. It\u2019s going to get very close in a lot of those tighter states. There\u2019s going to be more energy. I think the Democrat party would effectively be rewarded, if you will, by independents who would say, \u2018Hey none of us liked that whole Biden-Trump ticket to start with, you guys had the courage to change your nominee out.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Harris on Monday showed how she could use the symbolic imagery of the White House to enhance her own reputation. If she is to be elected in November, Americans need to begin to see her as a potential president. She made a start on that by welcoming National Collegiate Athletics Association championship teams \u2013\u00a0 a duty typically performed by presidents but that Harris inherited because Biden is nearing the end of his Covid-19 isolation. Harris paid a moving tribute to Biden, saying he had \u201csurpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the election, but it hung over an event in which she allied with the youthful aspirations of young athletes and wrapped herself in the flag in predicting US triumphs at the Paris Olympics. As House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who are both expected to soon endorse Harris, put it in a statement, \u201cVice President Kamala Harris is off to a great start with her promise to pursue the presidential nomination.\u201d Harris faces on oncoming storm But far harder tests lay ahead. \u2022 In racing to anoint Harris as the prohibitive potential nominee, Democrats are going all in on a candidate who is unpopular, has not yet demonstrated she can do better than Biden in key swing states and who sometimes showed a political tin ear during her 2020 primary campaign, which expired before the Iowa caucuses, and during her early vice presidency. If in the coming days or weeks, Harris stumbles, Democrats will risk being seen as a party that imposed on the country another 2024 candidate who is not up to the job. \u2022 The coming days will also test whether the electorate\u2019s frustration with the Democratic ticket was fueled by anxiety over Biden\u2019s age or a broader disdain brewed from frustration about economic conditions, including high prices and interest rates. Trump, after all, has usually led polling on issues that matter most to voters \u2014 from immigration to national security and the economy. If Biden\u2019s legacy is an electoral handicap, Harris could pay the price. \u2022 Trump\u2019s team is also ratcheting up the fury of rhetoric against Harris. It\u2019s trying to make her complicit in what Republicans are characterizing as a White House cover-up of the president\u2019s health and mental state. GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance on Monday claimed that \u201cKamala Harris lied about it. My Senate Democratic colleagues lied about it. The media lied about it. Every single person who saw Joe Biden knew that he wasn\u2019t capable of doing the job, and for three years they said nothing, until he became political deadweight.\u201d \u2022 There is another potential impediment to the Harris campaign, not yet fully in the spotlight, that could factor into the election. Sixteen years ago, many Americans believed that the country would never put a Black man in the White House. But Barack Obama proved the doubters wrong. Now Harris, a Black woman and Asian American, faces an even higher historic barrier.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/kamala-harris-challenges-ahead-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_electoral-votes-swing-state-margins-dg", "text": "Anyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states. There are concerns, particularly among Democrats, that President Joe Biden is losing support in these key states and they have pressured him to step aside for a different candidate. But even an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump and questions about Biden\u2019s fitness to serve another four years might not interrupt the larger dynamic of the race. \u201cI still think that this is a race where we are not going to see the polls move outside a pretty narrow window,\u201d Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN during coverage of the Republican National Convention. \u201cIf you liked Donald Trump last week, you still like him this week. If you liked Joe Biden last week, you still like him this week,\u201d she said. With those perceptions set, consider just how small the margins were in the 2020 election, consider that the states Biden turned from red to blue to defeat then-President Trump were won by securing a tiny fraction of voters in those states. In a 2024 rematch between the two, Trump will try to win those same states back from Biden, the Democrat aiming to win another term in the White House in November. The margins could be just as close. But to say that a small number of voters \u201cdecide\u201d the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved. Here\u2019s how things work: There are 538 Electoral College votes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation. The smallest states get three (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more. California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts). Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on. The winner is the candidate who gets 270 or more electoral votes. If no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives picks the winner from among the candidates who got electoral votes. A dozen states were decided by 5 percentage points or less in either the 2016 or 2020 presidential election. In CNN\u2019s 2024 race ratings, Maine is the only one of these states rated as solidly in one party\u2019s corner, but one congressional district within Maine is classified as a toss-up. The other 11 states are seen as competitive in the 2024 election.\u00a0See the ratings here. Viewed another way, we can expect that those states where the previous elections have been close to be the ones where the 2024 election will again be close. Polling backs up this presumption. In real numbers, the close margins in those relatively few states equal a very small number of voters in a country of more than 330 million people, but they are necessary for either candidate to reach an Electoral College count of 270. Some of those states came down to tens of thousands of votes. Biden won for Democrats in five states in 2020 \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 where Hillary Clinton lost, often by very small margins, in 2016. Florida, on the other hand, which has been a battleground for years, went more toward Trump in 2020. The campaigns will focus more attention on the fewer than one-third of all electoral votes they consider to be up for grabs or winnable by either party. Another thing to consider is that the number of electoral votes was reallocated after the 2020 election due to the every-10-years census required by the Constitution. North Carolina, Colorado and Florida, potential battlegrounds, each gained an electoral vote. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would become a battleground but which continues to tilt Republican despite shifting demographics, also gained two votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states that lost a vote. That also means that the populations of these states are changing over time. A battleground in 2024 could look very different in the future. And states that seem safe for either party today could be battlegrounds in the future. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, apportion some of their electoral votes by congressional district rather than giving all of them to the state winner. In 2020, for instance, Biden won a single vote in Nebraska and Trump won a single vote in Maine. These individual electoral votes could be incredibly important in the event of a tight election this year. The end result is that, yes, the 2024 election could again come down to relatively few voters in relatively few states. But questions remain over who those decisive voters are. Are they the voters who make most states reliably red or blue in most elections? Are they suburban women who were turned off by Trump in 2020, or are they people without a college degree who have moved toward the GOP? Are they older voters who have been trending toward Democrats or younger voters expressing an interest in Republicans? Are they more disinterested voters who only take part in the process every now and then, or is it a question of which party successfully motivates its stalwarts to turn out no matter what? It will take all of the above for either candidate to win. However, because the margins in certain states could be so small, incremental shifts in the preference or turnout of any larger group of voters could be decisive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/electoral-votes-swing-state-margins-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_vp-shortlist-kamala-harris", "text": "With President Joe Biden\u2019s support unleashing a flood of endorsements from many prominent Democrats across the country, Kamala Harris has emerged as the favorite to take his place as the party\u2019s nominee for president. Harris immediately\u00a0received the endorsements\u00a0of many Democratic party leaders and inherited the Biden campaign\u2019s war chest. The campaign\u00a0formally amended filings\u00a0with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. Now, the conversation is fast moving around who will serve as Harris\u2019 running mate. With only\u00a028 days\u00a0until the Democratic National Convention begins in Chicago, where Harris presumably will be officially nominated, the scramble to find the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential nominee has begun. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are among the Democrats who have been asked to submit information about their finances, family histories and other personal details, two people familiar with the process told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny. They are part of a group that includes about 10 names, nearly all of whom are elected officials. Here are some potential candidates to run alongside Harris: Josh Shapiro Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was elected in a landslide victory in 2022, defeating a 2020 election-denying\u00a0far-right state senator to become the third Jewish governor elected in the crucial swing state. Shapiro, who was previously Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general,\u00a0had\u00a0been floated by Democrats as a potential presidential prospect\u00a0and is also considered a potential running mate to Harris if she is the party\u2019s presidential nominee. During a stop in Philadelphia earlier this month, Harris called Shapiro a\u00a0\u201cgreat partner to the president and me.\u201d CNN previously reported that former President Barack Obama told Shapiro directly that he\u2019s among the 2022 generation of Democrats who need to have a voice in the future of the party, according to people familiar with the conversation.\u00a0Shapiro endorsed Harris on Sunday,\u00a0calling\u00a0her a \u201cpatriot worthy of our support.\u201d The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, has placed the governor in the spotlight. His response to the death of Corey Comperatore, the Trump supporter who was killed while shielding his wife and daughter, has especially been lauded. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference a day after the shooting. \u201cAnd most especially, Corey loved his family.\u201d Roy Cooper North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leads a state that is a crucial battleground in 2024. He was narrowly elected for the first time in 2016 by\u00a0just over 10,000 votes. He won reelection in 2020 and is term-limited out of running for a third time.\u00a0He\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris on Sunday, saying she \u201chas what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity.\u201d Throughout his time as governor, Cooper has clashed with lawmakers in the state legislature, where Republicans have a supermajority, over abortion rights and voting rights, among other things. Cooper previously waved off speculation that he might be on the shortlist for vice presidential nominees if Biden steps aside and Harris becomes the nominee. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play into this new favorite political parlor game, because it\u2019s too important for America to stop Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Cooper told CNN in July.\u00a0 In office, Cooper overcame longstanding opposition in the state\u2019s Republican-led legislature and achieved one of his top priorities last year when the North Carolina became the 40th state to\u00a0expand Medicaid\u00a0to low-income adults. More than 500,000 residents now have coverage through expansion. Biden and Harris heralded the achievement during a\u00a0joint campaign stop\u00a0in Raleigh in March in hopes of winning the state. First elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1986, Cooper has been a force in North Carolina politics for years. He rose to be the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate, and won his first statewide race for North Carolina attorney general in 2000. He held the post for four terms. Mark Kelly Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly represents a state that Biden won by only 10,457 votes in 2020 and has\u00a0national name recognition\u00a0both as a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He has been a reliable supporter of Democratic Party priorities while in office but has occasionally bucked his party, such as in 2023, when he\u00a0flatly called\u00a0the influx of undocumented migrants across the US southern border a \u201ccrisis.\u201d If Kelly, who swiftly\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris for president on Sunday, was elected to higher office, his seat\u00a0would remain\u00a0in Democratic hands as Gov. Katie Hobbs would be able to appoint his successor. Andy\u00a0Beshear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has been floated as a possible vice-presidential candidate. He won reelection to a second term last November in a deep-red state that Trump carried by about 25 points in 2020. He\u2019s the top elected Democrat in the Bluegrass state and made abortion a major issue in his campaign. After endorsing Harris, Beshear wasn\u2019t shy about expressing his willingness to run alongside her if asked. \u201cAre you at least open to the possibility of being a running mate to Vice President Harris?,\u201d Beshear was asked on MSNBC Monday morning. \u201cWell, I think if somebody calls you on that, what you do is, is at least listen,\u201d he replied. Beshear is one of the nation\u2019s most popular governors. He\u2019s made headlines for his leadership of the state through the Covid-19 pandemic, deadly tornadoes in 2021\u00a0and catastrophic flooding in 2022. Should Republicans retain control of the House and gain a majority in the Senate, he has experience navigating clashes with GOP lawmakers. He previously served as state attorney general before winning a narrow gubernatorial\u00a0victory in 2019, and his time as governor has been marked by disagreements over education, public assistance and tax policy with the Republican-led state legislature. His father, Steve Beshear, was Kentucky governor for two terms and\u00a0received national attention\u00a0for lowering the state\u2019s uninsured rate from more than 20% to 7.5%, one of the country\u2019s largest improvements following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. J.B. Pritzker Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker,\u00a0heir to the Hyatt hotel riches,\u00a0was first elected in 2018 and\u00a0sailed to reelection in 2022\u00a0by more than 10 percentage points. Pritzker,\u00a0who endorsed Harris on Monday morning,\u00a0has navigated a series of issues that have dominated the 2024 presidential race, from gun control to reproductive rights. He\u2019s led the state as it contends with\u00a0increased demand for abortion care\u00a0from women forced to travel from the South and Midwest in a post-Roe v. Wade era. In 2023, Pritzker signed\u00a0an extensive ban\u00a0on firearms and high-capacity magazines. He also signed\u00a0first-in-the-nation legislation\u00a0that prohibits book bans in the state. The governor, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson,\u00a0also confronted top White House officials\u00a0in October over the migrant crisis they warned was near a breaking point. Pete Buttigieg Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg styled himself as a centrist during his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, leaning in on his time as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and his service in the Afghanistan War. His\u00a0presidential run was historic: He was the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president, he broke barriers by becoming the first gay candidate to earn primary delegates for a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and also became the\u00a0first\u00a0Senate-confirmed out LGBTQ Cabinet secretary in history. It\u2019s been an eventful tenure for Buttigieg leading the Transportation Department: he was\u00a0criticized\u00a0for what was viewed as a slow federal response to the 2023 trail derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and he has often served as the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0leading critic\u00a0of the airline industry following flight delays and other mishaps. As a potential Harris running mate, Buttigieg would be an effective attack dog: he memorably\u00a0called\u00a0then-Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, a \u201ccheerleader for the porn star presidency,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s personal life, and has\u00a0delighted\u00a0liberals on social media by sparring with Fox News panelists. Buttigieg previewed how he\u2019d take on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d recently. He said he \u201cknew a lot of people like\u201d Vance, a Yale Law School graduate, at Harvard. \u201cI found a lot of people like him who would say whatever they needed to, to get ahead. Five years ago, that seemed like being the anti-Trump Republican, so that\u2019s what he was. \u2026 Five years later, the way he gets ahead is (Trump) is the greatest thing since sliced bread,\u201d Buttigieg said. Gretchen Whitmer Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who won reelection in the crucial swing state in 2022 by roughly 10 percentage points, was eyed by Democrats as a top candidate to replace Biden atop the ticket, though she\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris on Monday morning and appeared to take herself out of consideration in comments to local reporters. \u201cI am not leaving Michigan. I am proud to be the governor of Michigan. I have been consistent. I know everyone is always suspicious and asking this question over and over again,\u201d she told local reporters, The Detroit News\u00a0reported. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Whitmer, first elected governor in 2018, emerged as a prominent executive during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Her leadership decisions, which included stay-at-home orders, made\u00a0her the target of a kidnapping plot\u00a0in 2020. During her time in office, Whitmer has\u00a0also prioritized efforts\u00a0to expand affordable\u00a0access to health care. She has invested billions of dollars in the state\u2019s infrastructure and created a department tasked with improving the quality of drinking water in Michigan. She\u2019s\u00a0also\u00a0pitched herself as a staunch\u00a0defender of reproductive rights. In the weeks following the debate between Biden and Trump, Whitmer continued to voice support for the president, brushing aside rumors that she might step into the race should he withdraw. \u201cI understand that some are playing fantasy football and want to just pick a couple of random leaders that they like across the country and design a ticket. That\u2019s just not how this works,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip\u00a0earlier this month.\u00a0\u201cWe have a president who\u2019s gotten a nomination, who\u2019s earned it.\u201d Gavin Newsom California Gov. Gavin Newsom was the subject of 2024 presidential speculation last year, when he notably debated then-GOP candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Fox News and visited several Republican-led states.\u00a0He moved to endorse Harris on X Sunday evening,\u00a0writing, \u201cno one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump\u2019s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America\u2019s Vice President, @KamalaHarris.\u201d Like other Democratic governors who have been floated as potential 2024 picks,\u00a0Newsom steered his state through Covid-19. He\u00a0fought off a recall effort in 2021\u00a0that stemmed from partisan anger over his pandemic response. Newsom also received blowback for attending the unmasked birthday dinner of a lobbyist friend at an elite Napa Valley restaurant at a time when he was urging Californians to stay home. First elected in 2018, Newsom has called for Democrats to go on the offensive, calling out the GOP\u2019s stance on abortion restrictions, book bans and protections for the LGBTQ community, among other things. He was mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. If Harris becomes the Democratic nominee, Newsom, a fellow Californian, would run up against the\u00a012th Amendment of the Constitution, which would prohibit Golden State electors, all 54 of them, from voting for a president and vice president who share the same state as themselves. Theoretically, this snag could be avoided if either Harris and Newsom changed their official residencies, potentially even after the election but before the Electoral College meets.

{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_fact-checking-night-4-republican-national-convention-trump", "text": "Former President Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday with the most dishonest speech of the four-day Republican National Convention, making more than 20 false claims by CNN\u2019s count. Many of the false claims were ones Trump has made before, some of them for years. They spanned a wide variety of topics, including the economy, immigration, crime, foreign policy and elections. Some of them were wild lies, others smaller exaggerations. Some were in his prepared text (like the absurd claim that he left the Biden administration a world at peace), while he ad-libbed others (such as his usual lies that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election and that the US is experiencing the worst inflation it has ever had). Below is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s false or misleading remarks, plus a fact check of claims made by other Thursday convention speakers. Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden. Former President Donald Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. The current inflation rate, 3% in June 2024, is nowhere near the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920.  Trump could fairly say that the\u00a0inflation rate\u00a0hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but it has since plummeted. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s misleading claim about North Korean missile launches during his presidency Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that he \u201cgot along with\u201d North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and \u201cwe stopped the missile launches from North Korea.\u201d \u201cBut, no, I got along with him,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now North Korea is acting up again.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that he \u201cstopped the missile launches\u201d from North Korea is misleading. While missile launches did pause from North Korea for a period of time during his administration, they started up again before he left office.\u00a0 A May 2019 launch of what was assessed to be a short-range ballistic missile was North Korea\u2019s first since 2017, which was seen as a sign of growing frustration from Kim on the state of talks with the US. North Korea later launched two more missiles in July 2019, a month after Trump\u2019s high-profile meeting with Kim in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. North Korea conducted four missile tests in 2020. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on his claims of defeating ISIS in \u201ccouple of months\u201d Former President Donald Trump claimed in his RNC speech that \u201cwe defeated 100% of ISIS in Syria and Iraq,\u00a0something that was going to take five years. \u2026 We did it in a matter of a couple of months.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim of having defeated ISIS in \u201ca couple of months\u201d isn\u2019t true; the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq in late December 2018, as he has suggested in past remarks, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has before, when he said he defeated the terror group with no caveats or credit to anyone else. Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016. IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. \u201cThe Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group\u2019s governance project,\u201d an analyst there said in a statement at the time. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Donald Trump\u2019s misleading claim that federal judge ruled case against him was \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 Donald Trump said Thursday that the Florida federal judge who was overseeing the classified documents case dismissed the criminal charges against the former president, finding \u201cthat the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional.\u201d Facts first:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is misleading. District Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting the case, violated the Constitution. But Cannon specifically did not comment on the validity of the charges Trump was facing, or whether Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper. In a 93-page ruling\u00a0Monday, Cannon said\u00a0Smith\u2019s appointment\u00a0violated the Constitution. Cannon said that Smith\u2019s position as special counsel \u201ceffectively usurps\u201d Congress\u2019 \u201cimportant legislative authority,\u201d because Congress should have the authority \u2013 not the head of the Justice Department \u2013 to appoint such an official. Cannon also said that Smith\u2019s\u00a0office was being funded improperly. But Cannon also specifically noted that she was not deciding any \u201cother legal rights or claims\u201d brought by Trump or his co-defendants in the case. The judge also said that the Justice Department could potentially revive the case by funding the special counsel through different means. Prosecutors from outside the special counsel\u2019s office could also refile the charges. From CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz Trump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security During his Republican National Convention speech, former President Donald Trump again said that Democrats are harming Social Security and Medicare by letting migrants into the US. \u201cDemocrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people by the millions are coming in \u2013 they\u2019re going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things, and you\u2019re not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true, particularly in the near term, multiple experts say. Many undocumented immigrants work, which means they pay much-needed payroll taxes, and this bolsters the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and extends their solvency. Immigrants who are working legally typically won\u2019t collect benefits for many years. As for those who are undocumented, some are working under fake Social Security numbers, so they are paying payroll taxes but don\u2019t qualify to collect benefits. The Social Security Administration looked at the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security trust funds. It found that in 2010, earnings by unauthorized workers contributed roughly $12 billion on net to the entitlement program\u2019s cash flow. The agency has not updated the analysis since, but this year\u2019s Social Security trustees report noted that increasing average annual total net immigration by\u00a0100,000 persons\u00a0improves the entitlement program\u2019s solvency. \u201cWe estimate that future years will experience a continuation of this positive impact on the trust funds,\u201d said the\u00a0report on unauthorized immigration. Meanwhile, unauthorized immigrants contributed more than\u00a0$35 billion\u00a0on net to Medicare\u2019s trust fund between 2000 and 2011, extending the life of the trust fund by a year, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. \u201cImmigrants tend to be younger and employed, which increases the number of workers paying into the system,\u201d said Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor. \u201cAlso, they have more children, which helps boost the future workforce that will pay payroll taxes.\u201d \u201cImmigrants are good for Social Security,\u201d he said. However, undocumented immigrants who gain legal status that includes eligibility for future Social Security and Medicare benefits could ultimately be a drain to the system, according to Jason Richwine, a resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. \u201cIllegal immigration unambiguously benefits the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, but amnesty (legalization) would reverse those gains and add extra costs,\u201d\u00a0Richwine wrote\u00a0in a report last year. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump on trade deal with China Former President Donald Trump claimed that he struck a trade deal with China, requiring the country to purchase $50 billion worth of American products. \u201cThey buy $50 billion worth,\u201d he said at the Republican National Convention Thursday. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that China bought $50 billion worth of American product as a result of a trade deal is false. Trump is referring to what is known as the\u00a0Phase One deal\u00a0he struck with Beijing in December 2019. While the deal required China to buy\u00a0$50 billion worth of American agricultural products\u00a0by the end of 2021 \u2013 Beijing\u00a0did not live up to its commitment. US agricultural exports to China recovered from the trade war but did not reach the levels in the Phase One commitments, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco Donald Trump exaggerates how much higher gas prices are right now Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump described gas prices\u00a0inaccurately during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention. He said that \u201cgas prices are up 60%.\u201d Facts First: The average price of a regular gallon of gasoline nationwide is $3.51 as of Thursday, according to AAA. That\u2019s up about 47% from the day President Joe Biden was inaugurated, when the average was $2.39, not 60% higher as Trump claimed. Although the United States has a strategic gasoline reserve, which can be tapped by the White House to ease upward pressure on prices,\u00a0as Biden did in May, gas prices are still mostly determined by\u00a0market forces, such as global petroleum production and consumer demand, not solely by the decisions of a sitting US president. From CNN\u2019s Bryan Mena Trump claims government hired 88,000 IRS agents Former President Donald Trump, while recounting a conversation he had with a waitress worried about the taxes on her tips, claimed that the government recently hired 88,000 IRS agents to audit individuals. Facts First:\u00a0This claim is false.\u00a0 The Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 which Congress passed in 2022 without any Republican votes \u2013 provided an about $80 billion, 10-year investment to the IRS. The agency plans to hire tens of thousands of\u00a0IRS\u00a0employees with that money \u2013 but only some will be IRS agents who conduct audits and investigations. Many people will be hired for non-agent roles, such as customer service representatives. And a significant number of the hires are expected to fill the vacant posts left by retirements and other attrition, not take newly created positions. The 88,000 figure comes from a\u00a02021 Treasury Department report\u00a0that estimated the IRS could hire 86,852 full-time employees \u2013 not solely enforcement agents \u2013 over the course of a decade with a nearly $80 billion investment. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco Trump on Biden increasing Americans\u2019 taxes by four times Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim that President Joe Biden wants to hike people\u2019s taxes by four times. \u201cThis is the only administration that said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna raise your taxes by four times what you\u2019re paying now,\u2019\u201d Trump said Thursday in his speech at the Republican National Convention. Facts First:\u00a0This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024.\u00a0 Biden has not proposed quadrupling Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN in May that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s claim on the situation before the \u2018Right to Try\u2019 law Former President Donald Trump touted the \u201cRight to Try\u201d law he signed in 2018 in his convention speech Thursday, which gave terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven\u2019t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Before the measure was passed, Trump claimed,\u00a0terminally ill patients in the United States would have to go to foreign countries to seek experimental treatments or go home to die if they couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cSounds simple, but it\u2019s not, and I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will \u2013 \u00a0instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place \u2013 or if you have no money, going home and dying,\u201d he said. Facts First: This is misleading. It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications \u2013 but the government almost always said yes. Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump\u2019s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own \u201cexpanded access\u201d program. \u2018\u201cEmergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,\u201d Gottlieb testified. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Trump\u2019s claim about Russian warships near Cuba Former President Donald claimed in his RNC speech on Wednesday evening that \u201cRussian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off our coasts in Cuba. \u2026 The press refuses to write about it.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s present-tense claim that Russian warships and nuclear submarines \u201care\u201d operating close to the United States is misleading. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left. A group of four Russian Navy vessels\u00a0arrived in Cuba\u00a0on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The vessels left Havana on June 17. It is also not true that media organizations \u201cdon\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0CNN,\u00a0along\u00a0with\u00a0most\u00a0other\u00a0major news\u00a0outlets, reported on the Russian ships\u2019 positioning. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on military equipment left in Afghanistan Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim, which he has made in\u00a0speech\u00a0after\u00a0speech,\u00a0that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. Trump said, \u201cAnd we also left $85 billion dollars\u2019 worth of military equipment.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has\u00a0estimated\u00a0that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously\u00a0explained, the \u201c$85 billion\u201d is a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s false claim that the \u2018world was at peace\u2019 during his administration Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday, as many others at the RNC did, that while he was president the world was at peace. \u201cOur opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war,\u201d he also claimed later in his speech. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim about world peace under his presidency is false. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021. \u00a0\u00a0 US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa\u2019s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico\u2019s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump on Venezuela\u2019s crime rate Former President Donald Trump said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that \u201cin Venezuela, crime is down 72%\u201d because foreign governments are sending their countries\u2019 criminals to the US. Facts First:\u00a0Trump greatly overstated the Biden-era decline in crime in Venezuela, at least according to the limited statistics that are publicly available.\u00a0 And while it is certain that at least some criminals have joined law-abiding Venezuelans in a mass exodus from the country amid the economic crisis of the last decade, there is no proof Venezuela\u2019s government has deliberately emptied prisons for migration purposes or intentionally sent ex-prisoners to the United States. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s evidence-free claim on immigration Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that immigrants are \u201ccoming from prisons, they\u2019re coming from jails, they\u2019re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. \u2026 Terrorists are coming in at numbers we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that jails around the world are being emptied out so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants, nor for his claim that foreign governments are also emptying out mental health facilities for this purpose. Last year, Trump\u2019s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump\u2019s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN\u2019s own search did not produce any evidence. The website\u00a0FactCheck.org\u00a0also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that\u2019s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN\u2019s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump\u2019s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes \u2013 a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela\u2019s actions has never been corroborated. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s false claim on US crime statistics Former President Donald Trump claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that \u201cour crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim about a dramatic increase in the crime rate is false. Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime\u00a0dropped significantly in the US in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump\u2019s last calendar year in office. Preliminary FBI data for 2023\u00a0showed\u00a0a roughly\u00a013% national decline in murder\u00a0and a roughly 6% national decline in overall reported violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 \u2013 a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall reported violent crime. There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement \u2013 the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data\u00a0usually has some initial errors\u00a0\u2013 so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources\u00a0make it clear crime has indeed\u00a0declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline \u201cever recorded.\u201d And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also \u201ccrime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump blames Biden administration for \u2018greatest invasion in history\u2019 During his RNC speech, former President Donald Trump claimed that the Biden administration has done nothing to curb illegal immigration to the US. \u201cThe greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country\u2014they are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re coming at levels we\u2019ve never seen before it is an invasion indeed and this administration does nothing to stop them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that the Biden administration is doing \u201cnothing\u201d is incorrect.\u00a0Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration.\u00a0\u00a0Arrests along the US southern border dropped 29% in June, according to\u00a0new data\u00a0released by US Customs and Border Protection, following the Biden administration\u2019s order\u00a0severely limiting asylum-seeker crossings.\u201cRecent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,\u201d CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller previously said in a statement. Last month, the Biden administration\u00a0invoked an authority to shut off access\u00a0to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally,\u00a0a significant attempt\u00a0to address one of the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities. It was the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border, using the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand Trump makes claims about grocery prices rising under Biden Former President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that groceries are up 57% during the Biden administration. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims of grocery prices being up 57% are false and could use some context. Inflation\u2019s\u00a0rapid ascent,\u00a0which began in early 2021, was the result of a\u00a0confluence of factors, including effects from the Covid-19 pandemic such as\u00a0snarled supply chains\u00a0and\u00a0geopolitical fallout\u00a0(specifically Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine) that triggered food and energy price shocks.\u00a0Heightened consumer demand\u00a0boosted in part by fiscal stimulus from both the\u00a0Trump\u00a0and\u00a0Biden\u00a0administrations also led to higher prices, as did the post-pandemic imbalance in the labor market. Inflation peaked at 9.1%\u00a0in June 2022, hitting a 41-year high, and has slowed since (the Consumer Price Index\u00a0was at 3% as of June 2024). However, it remains elevated from historical levels. Three-plus years of pervasive and prolonged inflation has\u00a0weighed considerably on Americans, especially lower-income households trying to afford the necessities (food, shelter and transportation). Food prices, specifically grocery prices, did outpace overall inflation\u00a0for much of 2022 and 2023, driven higher by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Still, grocery prices didn\u2019t rise to the extent that Trump claims. Annual food and grocery inflation peaked at 11.4% and 13.5% in August 2022, respectively. Since Biden took office, the CPI \u201cfood at home\u201d index is up 21%, which is higher than its 9% typical rise in recent history over a 54-month period, but it\u2019s not 57%. Through the 12 months that ended in June, overall food and grocery prices\u00a0were up just\u00a02.2%\u00a0and\u00a01.1%, respectively. Certain food categories saw much greater inflation: Notably,\u00a0egg prices were up 70% annually\u00a0in January 2023. However, the\u00a0underlying cause of that sharp increase\u00a0was a highly contagious, deadly avian flu. Food prices are highly volatile and can be influenced by a variety of factors, especially disease,\u00a0extreme weather events, global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and once-in-a-lifetime pandemics. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Trump\u2019s misleading claim about energy independence Former President Donald Trump claimed that the US was \u201cenergy independent\u201d during his presidency but that this changed under President Joe Biden. Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading. \u201cEnergy independent\u201d is a political phrase, not a literal phrase, that can be defined in various ways \u2013 and, under Biden, the US has continued to satisfy the same definitions it satisfied under Trump. US production of oil and gas have set records under Biden. \u201cEnergy independent\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the US uses no foreign energy or that it is untethered from global energy markets; this wasn\u2019t the case under Trump and still isn\u2019t under Biden. Experts in energy policy tend to scoff at the term \u201cenergy independence,\u201d with three experts\u00a0telling CNN in 2022\u00a0that it is a \u201chorrible term,\u201d \u201cridiculous term\u201d and \u201cstupid term,\u201d respectively. But if the term is defined as the US exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, that has\u00a0happened in every year under Biden\u00a0after happening under Trump in 2020 for\u00a0the first time in decades. (In fact, the US surplus in petroleum trade has\u00a0grown under Biden\u00a0as US crude oil\u00a0production and\u00a0exports have hit new highs) And if the term is defined as the US producing more energy than it consumes, that has also\u00a0continued to happen under Biden\u00a0after\u00a0happening under Trump in 2019for the first time in decades. You can read\u00a0here about the various economic reasons the US has imported foreign energy under both Trump and Biden despite its so-called \u201cenergy independence.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Trump\u2019s false claim on his tax cuts Former President Donald Trump once again claimed\u00a0that he signed the largest tax cuts in history during his administration. \u201cWe got credit for the war, and defeating ISIS, and so many things. The great economy, the biggest tax cuts ever, the biggest regulation cuts ever, the creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much,\u201d Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. Facts First:\u00a0This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released in June, the\u00a0federal government\u2019s nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger \u2013 former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy \u2013 over five years. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and Obama\u2019s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the\u00a0eighth largest\u00a0since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby\u00a0 Trump\u2019s false claim US had \u2018no\u2019 inflation during his presidency Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that inflation did not exist during his presidency \u2013 drawing a contrast between his administration and that of President Joe Biden, whose early years in office were plagued by decades-high inflation. \u201cWe had no inflation,\u201d Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s comment is false. Inflation was low, but not nothing. The Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump\u2019s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump repeats frequent claim about oil drilling and gas prices As he has done repeatedly on the campaign trail, Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that under a new Trump administration, the United States would \u201cdrill, baby, drill, \u2026 by doing that, we will lead to a large-scale decline in prices.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s frequent campaign claim that the US can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil is misleading. Under President Joe Biden, US oil production has reached a new record this year, even surpassing output under Trump\u2019s administration. The Energy Information Administration expects crude oil production to hit successive records this year and next, powered by an oil boom in the Permian Basin. As CNN has reported, the US currently produces more oil than any other country on the planet, at about half a million barrels per day more than the prior annual record set in 2019. Prices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and the US cannot be truly energy independent when it comes to gas prices, energy experts have told CNN. Oil is a global commodity; the global price of oil determines US gas prices and it\u2019s simply impossible to separate that price from shifting global dynamics like Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine or OPEC\u2019s recent decisions to cut oil production. \u201cWhether we\u2019re drill baby, drilling has more to do with what the price of crude oil is, how healthy is the economy,\u201d Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN recently. \u201cThese things are outside of a president\u2019s direct control.\u201d There\u2019s also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, McNally told CNN last year. McNally compared the light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee. US oil refineries are specifically built to separate out the \u201cheavy and gunky\u201d crude we consume, McNally said. From CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen\u00a0 Pompeo falsely\u00a0claims Biden \u2018won\u2019t even talk about\u2019\u00a0American hostages\u00a0in Gaza Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on Thursday that President Joe Biden \u201cwon\u2019t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held\u201d in Gaza. \u201cAnd now of course a second war in Gaza. President Biden won\u2019t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held there by the Iranian regime,\u201d Pompeo said. Facts First: The claim that Biden \u201cwon\u2019t even talk about\u201d the American hostages in Gaza is false. Biden has spoken about the Americans held in Gaza in the wake of Hamas\u2019 invasion of Israel several times since October.  Recently on May 31, speaking about a proposed deal for Israel and Hamas, Biden said American hostages would be released in the first phase of the deal: \u201c[W]e want them home.\u201d On October 25, Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock together with our partners in\u00a0the region to secure the release of hostages including American citizens \u2026 left behind.\u201d On November 26, he spoke extensively about the release of an Israeli American little girl who was held hostage and said he was pressing for more Americans to be released, adding, \u201cwe will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones.\u201d Most recently, at the NATO Summit in DC last week, Biden talked about hostages broadly, saying the US \u201chas been working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, to bring the hostages home, to create a path for peace and stability in the Middle East.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump biographical video includes false and misleading claims The Republican National Convention played a biographical video about former President Donald Trump before Trump began his own speech. The video included false and misleading claims. The Trump tax cuts The video featured a narrator making a claim that Trump himself\u00a0frequently utters. The narrator said, \u201cThe Trump tax cuts: largest in America\u2019s history.\u201d This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. You can read a detailed fact check here. Global conflict under Trump The video\u2019s narrator also delivered a version of another claim Trump has\u00a0made repeatedly, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cstrength and resolve\u201d produced \u201ca stable\u00a0world at peace.\u201d This claim about world peace under Trump is false, too. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021. US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa\u2019s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico\u2019s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021. Americans\u2019 incomes  While attacking President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, the video featured on-screen text that said,\u00a0\u201cU.S. incomes fall for third straight year,\u201d attributing those words to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0article\u00a0in 2023. An image of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was shown on screen at the same time. This combination of words and images is misleading. The video didn\u2019t acknowledge that the first of the three straight years in which the Wall Street Journal article reported that inflation-adjusted median household income went down\u00a0was 2020, when Trump was president.\u00a0(The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline.) Real median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Eric Trump\u2019s false claims about the economy and US global standing in 2016 Eric Trump told the crowd at the RNC Thursday that the \u201ceconomy was struggling, jobs were scarce\u201d and the US had poor standing on the global stage when his father was elected president in 2016. Facts First: Eric Trump\u2019s claims are false. When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he inherited a strong economy, including a robust labor market, and a nation that was viewed favorably on the global stage. In 2016, the US added an average of nearly 194,000 jobs per month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In the two years before, those average gains were even higher: 226,000 in 2015 and nearly 250,000 in 2014. Job gains remained above historical averages in 2017 through 2019, with 177,000 jobs added on average per month. Eric Trump\u2019s claims that jobs were scarce in 2016 were not accurate. In fact, the US labor market experienced its longest expansion on record starting in 2010 and continuing until March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic crippled global economies, including that of the US. In addition to inheriting a labor market in good shape, the economy was growing when Trump took office. Real gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic activity \u2013 typically grows between 2% and 3%, and it averaged 2.4% between 2014-2016 and then nearly 2.7% during the first three years of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Also, the US was well regarded internationally when Barack Obama left office, and those sentiments plunged at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Pompeo\u2019s claim about the southern border under Trump Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that the US-Mexico border was \u201cclosed\u201d during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Facts First: Pompeo\u2019s claim is false.  While Trump tightened the border during his tenure, illegal crossings into the US from Mexico still numbered in the tens of thousands each month leading up to when he left office. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration limited non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border and prohibited migrants from crossing it in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. President Joe Biden later extended the restrictions. The former president\u2019s biggest effort to \u201cclose\u201d the border was met with resistance by federal courts, and the Supreme Court later gave Biden the green light to end the controversial \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. From CNN\u2019s Devan Cole Trump makes false claims about election fraud in RNC video For the fourth straight night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use \u201cevery appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,\u201d including voting by mail.\u00a0Trump\u00a0relentlessly disparaged\u00a0mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has\u00a0continued to sharply criticize\u00a0it during the current campaign But Trump\u2019s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would \u201conce and for all secure our elections\u201d as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, \u201cWe never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.\u201d\u00a0And he said, \u201cKeep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it\u2019s the only thing they do well.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims are nonsense \u2013 slightly vaguer versions of his\u00a0usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and\u00a0stolen\u00a0and\u00a0that Democrats\u00a0are serial election cheaters.\u00a0The\u00a02020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump\u2019s opponents excel. The Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said\u00a0in a post-election November 2020 statement: \u201cThe November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d \u00a0From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Pompeo\u2019s false claim about spy balloons Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday evening that under former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, \u201cnot a single Chinese spy balloon flew across\u201d the US. \u201cWe\u2019d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,\u201d Pompeo said. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false. Three suspected Chinese spy balloons\u00a0transited over the continental US\u00a0during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u00a0said in 2023\u00a0that a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d allowed the balloons to travel undetected. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Linda McMahon\u2019s misleading claim on tariffs Linda McMahon, who served in the Trump administration as the Small Business Administrator, suggested at the Republican National Convention Thursday that China paid the tariffs that the former president put on roughly $300 billion of Chinese-made goods. \u201cInstead of taxing American companies, Donald Trump put tariffs on China that raised billions of dollars and protected American industries,\u201d she said. Facts First: This characterization of Trump\u2019s tariffs is misleading.  It\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s tariffs on China raised billions of dollars for the US government, but the duties were paid by US companies \u2013 not China. Study after study, including one from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission (USITC), has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products. Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods \u2013 whether that\u2019s a retailer or a consumer. Many economists agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers. \u201cA tariff is just a form of a tax,\u201d Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN earlier this year. Tariffs can benefit some companies by raising the prices of competing foreign-made goods, but the duties can hurt other companies by raising component parts they need to manufacture. For example, Trump\u2019s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector \u2013 but that industry lost jobs. Federal Reserve economists\u00a0found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That\u2019s mostly because goods became more expensive to US consumers. Plus,\u00a0retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco RNC video featuring Reagan\u2019s voice misleadingly twists magazine article A video played on the final night of the Republican National Convention tried to attack President Joe Biden by featuring quotes from then-candidate Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous rhetorical questions about the President Jimmy Carter era at a presidential debate against Carter in 1980. At one point, the video featured Reagan\u2019s voice asking if, compared to four years ago,\u00a0\u201cIs America as respected throughout the world as it was?\u201d On-screen text answered the question with the words \u201callies no longer trust the United States,\u201d attributing them to a September 2021 article in Foreign Affairs magazine. Facts First: This quote is misleading. The article in Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t actually declare that allies no longer trust the United States. Rather, the article noted that \u201ccritics of President Joe Biden\u201d make the \u201cclaim\u201d that allies no longer trust the US after Biden\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2013 but the article then went on to argue that \u201cthese concerns about credibility are overblown.\u201d The convention video also featured Reagan\u2019s voice asking, \u201cIs there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?\u201d But if you go back precisely four years from the most recent unemployment rate, the answer is: less unemployment. The current unemployment rate is 4.1% for June 2024; four years prior, in June 2020, the unemployment rate was 11.0% amid the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a reasonable basis for this part of the video, though, if you interpret \u201cfour years ago\u201d more broadly to refer to any time in 2020. Before the pandemic, in the first two months of 2020, the unemployment rates were 3.6% and 3.5%.

Clooney is seen by many Democratic backers in Hollywood as a sort of compass given his engagement and activism. When he\u00a0penned a New York Times op-ed\u00a0earlier this month calling for the president to not seek reelection in the wake of his disastrous debate performance, it was one of several watershed moments in a movement that ultimately ended with Biden\u2019s decision on Sunday to exit the race. \u201cPresident Biden has shown what true leadership is. He\u2019s saving democracy once again. We\u2019re all so excited to do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris in her historic quest,\u201d Clooney said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. Before his op-ed, Clooney\u2019s standing with Biden had helped rally wider donor and celebrity support, even among some who had never been big Biden fans and were not enthused about backing him long before the debate. The June fundraiser he headlined raised $28 million for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, the most for the Democratic Party from a single event in history. So when he wrote\u00a0that the Biden he saw during the fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \u201cwas not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020,\u201d it was a startling admission from a leading Democratic booster and someone who has interacted with Biden privately that, in his view, the president was unfit to serve to another term. \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney added in his op-ed, referencing Biden\u2019s faltering performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN. Clooney\u2019s new statement is the latest in a\u00a0wave\u00a0of endorsements, including those from state delegations, that have helped\u00a0push\u00a0Harris\u00a0over the threshold\u00a0needed to secure the\u00a0Democratic\u00a0presidential nomination.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_iowa-abortions-after-six-weeks-law", "text": "An Iowa judge has ruled the state\u2019s\u00a0strict abortion law\u00a0will take effect Monday, preventing most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The law passed last year, but a judge had blocked it from being enforced. The Iowa Supreme Court reiterated in June there is no constitutional right to an abortion in the state and ordered the hold to be lifted. That translated into Monday\u2019s district court judge\u2019s decision ordering the law to go into effect next Monday at 8 a.m. local time. Lawyers representing abortion providers asked Judge Jeffrey Farrell for notice before allowing the law to take hold, saying a buffer period was needed to provide continuity of services. Iowa requires pregnant women to wait 24 hours for an abortion after getting an initial consultation. Abortion had been legal in the state up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. The high court\u2019s order gave a decisive win to Iowa\u2019s Republican leaders after years of legislative and legal battles. Iowa will join more than a dozen states where abortion access has been sharply curbed in the two years since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Currently,\u00a014 states\u00a0have near-total bans at all stages of pregnancy and three states ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. That\u2019s roughly when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Iowa\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed the law in a special session last July, and a\u00a0legal challenge was immediately filed\u00a0by the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic. The law was in effect for just a few days before a district court judge temporarily blocked it. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state Supreme Court \u201chas upheld the will of the people of Iowa,\u201d and Republican Attorney General Brenna Bird called it \u201ca landmark victory.\u201d There are limited circumstances under the Iowa law that would allow for abortion after six weeks of pregnancy: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has an abnormality \u201cincompatible with life\u201d; or if the pregnancy endangers the mother\u2019s life. The state\u2019s medical board defined\u00a0standards of practice\u00a0earlier this year, though the rules do not outline how the board would determine noncompliance or what the appropriate disciplinary action might be. Representatives from Planned Parenthood and the Emma Goldman Clinic have indicated they will continue to provide abortion services in Iowa in compliance with the law. In June, Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, also said the organization had spent the last year making \u201clong-term regional investments\u201d in preparation for this outcome, including expanding facilities in Mankato, Minnesota, and in Omaha, Nebraska, \u2014 both cities near Iowa. Planned Parenthood in Iowa has ceased abortion services in two Iowa cities in the last year, including in Des Moines. Two of the state\u2019s five Planned Parenthood clinics offer in-person abortion services, and three offer abortion through medication.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/iowa-abortions-after-six-weeks-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_lbj-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is the first president in more than a generation to decide not to seek a second term. But Biden\u2019s situation is unique in American politics. He had planned to run and won nearly every delegate to the Democratic National Convention next month. Questions about his age and acuity ultimately convinced him to pull out of the presidential race. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be his successor as the Democratic presidential nominee. Biden announced his decision in a letter posted to social media after weeks of fevered speculation, making him one of a handful of presidents who decided to step aside rather than seek reelection. Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here\u2019s part of that address: It is a remarkable speech to watch today. Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded. By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson\u2019s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted. Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16. Health was a concern for LBJ Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term. \u201cThere\u2019s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,\u201d Updegrove said. \u201cHe had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn\u2019t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,\u201d Updegrove added. A year of incredible uncertainty 1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson\u2019s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty. Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities. In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent. In 1968, Democrats ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside. That November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states. Johnson remains one of the country\u2019s most transformative presidents Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a \u201cgreat society,\u201d including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty. Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South.

{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, said two-and-a-half years ago he was open to a national abortion ban, a stark contrast to comments he made this week where the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion should be a state issue. Vance argued in 2022 that people seeking abortions would travel from states where abortion is banned to states with liberal abortion laws, necessitating federal action. \u201cI certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,\u201d Vance said in January 2022 on a podcast when running for Senate. On Monday, the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion was a state issue, though in practice that means abortion can be banned in one state and entirely protected in another. \u201cMy view is that Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his views on abortion are going to be the views that dominate this party and drive this party forward,\u201d Vance said to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday. \u201cAlabama\u2019s going to make a different decision from California. That is a reasonable thing. And that\u2019s how I think we build some bridges and have some respect for one another.\u201d Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion, voters have consistently supported abortion rights in state measures, and the 2022 midterm elections saw numerous anti-abortion Republicans defeated. Many Republicans, including Vance, have shifted or moderated their abortion positions to align with the current political climate, where anti-abortion rhetoric and policies are seen as increasingly toxic and detrimental to election success. After Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in 2023, effectively repealing the state\u2019s six-week ban, Vance critiqued the Republican Party\u2019s messaging on abortion. \u201cWe have to recognize how much voters mistrust us (meaning elected Republicans) on this issue,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. Vance\u2019s office pointed CNN to past statements on abortion from Vance as a senator, including one from CNN last December where he said, \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\u201d He also expressed support for exceptions in the case of the \u201clife of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d Vance once supported a \u201cnational minimum standard\u201d for abortion restrictions and signaled support for a 15-week federal abortion ban to CNN before determining there was no appetite for it in the current climate. Yet in January 2022, Vance argued that while lawmakers couldn\u2019t ban abortion in the current climate, he was sympathetic to the view that a national ban was necessary. Vance proposed a hypothetical scenario where if Roe vs. Wade was overturned and Ohio banned abortion by 2024, liberal mega donor and philanthropist George Soros \u2014 a popular bogeyman in conservative circles might then facilitate abortions for \u201cdisproportionately black women\u201d by flying them to California. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here\u2019s a situation \u2014 let\u2019s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let\u2019s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity \u2014 uh, that\u2019s kind of creepy.\u201d \u201cAnd, and it\u2019s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?\u201d Vance said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sympathetic to that actually. So, you know, how hopefully we get to a point where Ohio bans abortion in California and the Soroses of the world respect it.\u201d \u201cThe left has this weird desire to conquer everything, right? So I tend to think that these balances are always a little tenuous and eventually, either on any given issue, the left is gonna win or we\u2019re gonna win,\u201d he concluded. On Monday, delegates at the Republican National Convention approved their party\u2019s new platform with toned-down rhetoric on abortion that aligned with Trump\u2019s state-based approach to the issue. The move has angered some anti-abortion groups who opposed abandoning the party\u2019s old long-standing language, including the de-emphasis on abortion restrictions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_power-plant-emissions-supreme-court-republicans", "text": "Over 20 Republican state attorneys general asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to temporarily block the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing new rules that aim to curb planet-warming emissions from power plants. The filing comes days after a federal appeals court in Washington, DC, turned down a similar emergency request from the officials and industry groups. They want the new rules shelved while their legal challenge plays out in federal courts. The EPA\u2019s new rules will compel existing coal and new natural gas power plants to either cut or capture 90% of their climate pollution by 2032. The rules are expected to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from the sector by 75% compared to a peak in 2005. In their filing with the Supreme Court, the challengers said the EPA rules would be too costly for power plants and could force them to close. They told the court that the EPA rules relied on \u201cinadequately demonstrated technologies on unworkable timeframes, effectively squeezing plants into retirement.\u201d It\u2019s likely that the court will ask the agency to respond to the states\u2019 emergency request before it takes substantive action on it. CNN has reached out to the EPA for comment. In a 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court curbed the EPA\u2019s power to regulate pollution from power plants but did not entirely take away the agency\u2019s authority to do so. In crafting the most recent power plant rules, which were finalized earlier this spring, the EPA tried to hew as close to the law as possible, anticipating legal challenges. The Biden administration\u2019s proposal would push utilities to outfit many power plants with costly carbon capture technology or add clean hydrogen fuel to reduce their emissions. The rules are being paired with generous tax subsidies for carbon capture and hydrogen in Biden\u2019s climate law. \u201cOur position remains the same: this rule strips the states of important discretion while using technologies that don\u2019t work in the real world,\u201d West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, one of the leaders of the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday. After the significant court challenge to Obama-era rules prevailed at the Supreme Court in 2022, the new regulations give power generators options to choose how they meet pollution requirements. The EPA also announced in February it would delay its rulemaking process for carbon emissions from existing gas plants, which had initially been covered under the agency\u2019s proposal last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/power-plant-emissions-supreme-court-republicans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Notably, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\u00a0one of the most influential Democratic lawmakers in Washington,\u00a0endorsed Harris\u2019 campaign in a statement Monday, saying  \u201centhusiastic support\u201d and \u201cimmense pride and limitless optimism for our country\u2019s future.\u201d Other high-ranking members of Democratic leadership, including Whip Katherine Clark, Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu, quickly endorsed Harris, along with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus. However, Schumer and Jeffries did not immediately endorse Harris, at first stating that they \u201clook forward to meeting in person with Vice President Harris shortly as we collectively work to unify the Democratic Party and the country.\u201d Many of Harris\u2019 potential challengers, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, endorsed the vice president, giving her a clear path to the nomination. Plus, a wave of endorsements from state delegations Monday evening\u00a0pushed her over the threshold\u00a0needed to secure the Democratic nomination.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_harris-immigration-work-gop-attacks", "text": "As a border crisis unfolded only months into Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, he looked to his vice president to help solve an intractable issue: migration. It seemed like a no-win political assignment. Vice President Kamala Harris and her staff quickly sought to make one thing clear: She wasn\u2019t charged with managing the southern border. Three years later, that task looms over Harris\u2019 unprecedented campaign\u00a0for the White House, becoming a central line of attack\u00a0from\u00a0Republicans. \u201cAs a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it\u2019s getting worse, not better,\u201d former President Donald Trump said in a rare call with reporters Tuesday, falsely claiming Harris had been appointed Biden\u2019s \u201cborder czar.\u201d The management of the US-Mexico border has been a political liability for Biden, and it will now follow Harris as Trump makes it a cornerstone of his campaign. Over the last three years,\u00a0an unprecedented number of border crossings have come to define the administration\u2019s immigration record \u2014 recently resulting in the White House taking an aggressive measure to dramatically clamp down on asylum at the US southern border. As the vice president\u2019s campaign takes shape and as immigration remains a top issue for voters, her team is forced to contend with an assignment that, sources say, has showed early success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment but that\u2019s been bundled with the administration\u2019s larger migration issues. In the first rally of her 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday, Harris didn\u2019t mention border security. The issue has generally not been featured prominently at campaign rallies over the last year, but both Harris and Biden have recently cited the bipartisan immigration deal that was scuttled by Trump to make the case that Republicans aren\u2019t serious about border security. The\u00a0House\u00a0GOP campaign arm\u00a0is also encouraging\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0to focus on what it describes as Harris\u2019 failed border policies, according to a memo obtained by CNN. Harris\u2019 root cause work dates to March 2021.\u00a0During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America, seeing\u00a0the assignment\u00a0as a sign of respect, having done the same job himself under former President Barack Obama. While\u00a0Harris\u00a0focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible\u00a0for\u00a0overseeing border security. At the time, most minors apprehended at the US southern border were from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014\u00a0a region that was hard-hit by major hurricanes and the Covid-19 pandemic and that had been a main source of migration over the last decade. As the vice president\u2019s team began strategizing, the problem facing the administration grew. Seven months later, it was migrants arriving from even farther away in South America \u2014 outside of Harris\u2019 assigned portfolio \u2014 who were overwhelming the Biden administration. Border crossings surged, and Republicans pointed their fingers at the vice president, dubbing Harris the \u201cborder czar,\u201d a title the White House rejected, arguing that her focus was on the region and not on border security.\u00a0And in 2022, as an affront to Harris, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, began busing migrants to her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar\u00a0of California\u00a0on Tuesday called efforts by House Republicans to paint Harris as a border czar \u201claughable and unserious.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear, there was no \u2018border czar.\u2019 Kamala Harris\u2019 role was to engage in multilateral discussion with our Latin American countries,\u201d the House Democratic Caucus chair told reporters. Harris\u00a0has\u00a0only occasionally talked about\u00a0her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. And it\u2019s the comments she made early on that will likely be used by Republicans in the months to come. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt in June 2021, roughly five months after taking office, Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn\u2019t yet visited the US-Mexico border. \u201cAt some point, you know, we are going to the border,\u201d\u00a0the vice president\u00a0said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the border. So this whole \u2026 thing about the border. We\u2019ve been to the border. We\u2019ve been to the border.\u201d Holt responded: \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to the border.\u201d \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t been to Europe. And I mean, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t understand the point that you\u2019re making,\u201d Harris said with a laugh. She added: \u201cI\u2019m not discounting the importance of the border.\u201d Later that month, Harris visited the border. Harris navigates one of the most politically fraught issues White House officials quickly worked to get Harris up to speed after she was assigned to tackle the root causes of migration. Officials pulled together a series of memos examining what Biden had done when he was vice president and held a similar role, analyzing what worked and what could be done better, according to a former senior administration official. In some ways, the region had already been familiar territory for Harris, dating to her days as California\u2019s attorney general. \u201cIn terms of the root causes piece as VP, there\u2019s a through line in her work as AG starting to build relationships in Mexico and Central America,\u201d said Daniel Suvor, former chief of policy to then-Attorney General Harris and now partner at O\u2019Melveny & Myers, arguing that her work has often focused on concrete, measurable outcomes. Officials met daily, briefing the vice president along the way, with another former senior administration official describing the process as \u201cintense\u201d amid a worsening crisis at the border. \u201cShe ultimately studied that and put her own stamp on it, which was the private-sector component,\u201d one of the former senior administration officials said, noting that was an area they concluded Biden, as vice president, didn\u2019t have time to fully develop. Harris pulled together the\u00a0Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region. Earlier this year, Harris met with President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo of Guatemala to strengthen the US-Guatemala bilateral relationship and discuss good governance, economic opportunity, security and migration management, according to\u00a0a White House\u00a0readout. Around 56 companies\u00a0are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications, and nonprofit sectors to bolster the region\u2019s economy. Together, they\u2019ve invested more than $5 billion. Experts credit Harris\u2019 ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments. Honduran Minister of Investment Miguel Medina argued that having the White House behind the initiative has been instrumental in bringing big companies and private-sector money into the region. \u201cThe difference with the partnership is that the facilitating that they\u2019ve been doing, and they continue to do, that facilitating is not something that is accessible to a normal company in Honduras,\u201d he said, citing, for example, work with Nespresso to purchase and sell coffee beans. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this being moved from the White House, there\u2019s \u2026 no way we could have had the success that it\u2019s had,\u201d Medina added. While it\u2019s difficult to measure the direct impact on migration, US Customs and Border Protection has seen a considerable drop in migrants arriving\u00a0at\u00a0the southern border from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to federal data. \u201cFor the long term, she certainly can claim credit for having started off efforts to improve people\u2019s lives in Central America,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/harris-immigration-work-gop-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_wisconsin-visit-kamala-harris-campaign", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris, in the first rally of her 2024 presidential campaign, told supporters in Wisconsin Tuesday that she will spend the coming weeks \u201ccontinuing to unite our party\u201d ahead of the Democratic National Convention next month and this fall\u2019s showdown with Donald Trump. Harris\u2019 rally in Milwaukee\u00a0featured similar policies\u00a0to the stump speeches she has delivered on the campaign trail for months \u2014\u00a0drawing\u00a0the sort of sharp contrasts with Trump that President Joe Biden had long struggled to articulate before he dropped out of the 2024 race on Sunday.\u00a0But the rhetoric Tuesday was different \u2013 and very much her own. However, it came with much more attention now that Harris is the Democratic standard-bearer. Speaking about her record as a prosecutor in California, Harris said she \u201ctook on perpetrators of all kinds: Predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.\u201d \u201cSo hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d she said. Her quip was met with chants in the packed high school gymnasium of \u201clock him up\u201d \u2014 an echo of the \u201clock her up\u201d chants that were prominent at Trump rallies in 2016, when he faced Hillary Clinton. Harris noted that less than two days after Biden exited the race and endorsed his vice president, she had amassed enough support from DNC delegates to become the party\u2019s nominee. She also nodded at the critical role Wisconsin will play in the race for 270 electoral college votes. \u201cThe path to the White House goes through Wisconsin. And to win in Wisconsin, we are counting on you, right here in Milwaukee. And you helped us win in 2020. And in 2024, we will win again,\u201d she said. She sought to drive an economic message that was much clearer and more forward-looking than Biden\u2019s case for his own accomplishments. \u201cBuilding up the middle class,\u201d Harris told supporters, \u201cwill be a defining goal of my presidency.\u201d Harris also pointed to what she called Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme Project 2025 agenda.\u201d Trump has disavowed the Heritage Foundation-backed policy plan, which was created by many of his former staffers. However, many of its most conservative and controversial proposals have become central planks in Democratic attacks on Trump. \u201cWe are not going back,\u201d she vowed, prompting the crowd to chant, \u201cWe\u2019re not going back.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s rally in Wisconsin came at the end of a 48-hour stretch that had turned the 2024 race on its head. By Monday night, less than 36 hours after Biden had announced he was dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president, Harris had secured enough commitments from Democratic National Convention delegates to effectively lock down the nomination. She had also raised more than $100 million from 1.1 million different donors \u2014 62% of them first-time contributors \u2014 between Sunday and Monday, a Harris campaign official said. The enormous figure reflects the new energy within what had been a morose Democratic base. The top two congressional Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, endorsed Harris at a news conference Tuesday, joining a cascade of Democratic lawmakers and governors who have announced their support. \u201cNow that the process has played out from the grassroots, bottom-up, we are here today to throw our support behind\u201d Harris, Schumer said. Top Wisconsin Democratic officials, including two-term Gov. Tony Evers and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection this year, also have endorsed Harris. They are among a long list of Democratic officials and candidates who appeared with the vice president on Tuesday. Harris\u2019 campaign, inheriting the infrastructure put in place during Biden\u2019s candidacy, has 48 coordinated offices in 43 counties in Wisconsin, including 160 full-time staffers. The campaign is also touting a boost in its organizing since Harris announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination, with more than 58,000 individuals signing up to volunteer as of Tuesday morning \u2013 up from the nearly 30,000 announced Monday afternoon. The trip to Wisconsin \u2014 one of the three \u201cBlue Wall\u201d states, alongside Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2014 is Harris\u2019 fifth there this year and ninth since becoming vice president. With Biden as the Democratic nominee, the party\u2019s path to winning 270 electoral college votes went directly through these states. It may be the same for Harris. However, it\u2019s too early to tell whether another path \u2014 one that includes Sun Belt swing states Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia \u2014 might be a larger part of the Harris calculation. The governor of one of those states, North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper, and a senator from another, Arizona\u2019s Mark Kelly, are among the names being floated as being a part of her vice presidential shortlist, a group that also includes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, Covington & Burling, will handle the vetting of Harris\u2019 running mate, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The auditions are already in full swing, with Beshear taking a rhetorical two-by-four to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, calling the GOP vice presidential nominee a \u201cphony\u201d and \u201cfake\u201d while pointing to his evolution from Trump critic to MAGA heir. \u201cThe problem with JD Vance is he has no conviction. But I guess his running mate has 34,\u201d Beshear said Monday night during an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle", "text": "US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has tendered her resignation amid scrutiny of security lapses related to the recent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, sources tell CNN. The move\u00a0comes as lawmakers and an internal government watchdog move forward with investigations into the agency\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s protection and how a gunman came close to the killing the 2024 Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania this month. Cheatle said in her resignation letter that she made the \u201cdifficult\u201d decision to leave the agency \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t want her departure to distract agents from their mission. \u201cIn light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that, I have made the difficult decision to step down as your Director,\u201d Cheatle wrote. She acknowledged that on July 13, the day of the shooting, the agency \u201cfell short\u201d of its mission to \u201cto protect our nation\u2019s leaders.\u201d Secret Service Deputy Director Ronald Rowe has been tapped to lead the agency, the Department of Homeland Security announced. In a statement, President Joe Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden are \u201cgrateful\u201d for Cheatle\u2019s decades of public service. \u201cAs a leader, it takes honor, courage, and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service,\u201d Biden said of Cheatle. There have been bipartisan calls in Congress for Cheatle\u2019s resignation and a push by Republican lawmakers to impeach her. Lawmakers were particularly incensed after her appearance in front of the House Oversight Committee on Monday, where she was unwilling to answer many of the committee\u2019s questions. During her House Oversight appearance, Cheatle acknowledged that there were \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201ccolossal\u201d problems with the security at the rally, but still rebuffed demands for her resignation. \u201cI think I am the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time,\u201d\u00a0Cheatle\u00a0said Monday. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the resignation is \u201coverdue.\u201d \u201cNow we have to pick up the pieces,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe have to rebuild the American people\u2019s faith and trust in the Secret Service as an agency. It has an incredibly important responsibility in protecting presidents, former presidents, and other officials in the executive branch, and we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d In the initial wake of the shooting, Cheatle was emphatic that she would not step down. Cheatle was appointed by Biden to lead the Secret Service in 2022. In an interview with CNN last week, Cheatle said that the agency was \u201csolely responsible\u201d for the design and implementation of security at the Pennsylvania rally site, where the now-deceased gunman fired shots at Trump from an unsecured rooftop just a few hundred feet from the rally stage. A bullet hit Trump\u2019s ear, and the incident left one rallygoer dead and others injured. As more has become known about the circumstances around the attempted attack, the Secret Service has been questioned about how it carried its protection of Trump that day, including the failure to control access to the rooftop and how the agency handled information, passed along by local law enforcement before the shooting, that identified the would-be assassin as a person acting suspiciously around the rally grounds. The Secret Service and the Pennsylvania law enforcement, which assisted in the rally security efforts, have sometimes been at odds in their accounts of what happened and who was responsible for the lapses. Cheatle had pledged her agency\u2019s full cooperation with the congressional and internal government examinations of Secret Service\u2019s approach to that day. Cheatle had left a job managing Global Security at PepsiCo to take the USSS director post and before her stint in the private sector, had served in the Secret Service for 27 years.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_house-progressives-counter-programming-netanyahu", "text": "A number of Democratic lawmakers are planning to participate in a series of counter-programming events on Wednesday instead of attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress, the latest example of how Democrats remain divided over Israel\u2019s handling of its war with Hamas. At the same time Netanyahu is expected to address Congress, a variety of progressive nonprofit groups are hosting an event in the Capitol that multiple Democratic lawmakers are expected to attend, according to an invitation shared with CNN. The event, \u201cPeace is Possible: An Alternative Vision for Israel and Palestine,\u201d will feature Israeli and Palestinian peace leaders and is hosted by groups like the Center for American Progress and Middle East Democracy Center. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, is expected to deliver opening remarks at the event, according to an advisory shared with CNN. Meanwhile, Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Greg Casar of Texas will host a Zoom news conference with a coalition of progressives to try and pressure the Biden administration and Congress to adopt an arms embargo against Israel as activists argue that supplying weapons to Israel creates human rights violations. Separately, senior House Democrats including Reps. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Jamie Raskin of Maryland will meet with the families of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas terror attack. Approximately 80 House Democrats and at least six Democratic senators are expected to skip Netanyahu\u2019s speech on Wednesday, according to sources and public statements reviewed by CNN. House Democratic leadership has given their members room to make their own decisions about whether to attend the speech. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, will not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu\u2019s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, and she is expected to meet separately with Netanyahu later this week. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech, leaving Senate Foreign Relations Chair Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, to preside, a source familiar told CNN. Ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s address, House Speaker Mike Johnson sent a letter to lawmakers obtained by CNN informing lawmakers that there will be \u201can increased police presence around the Capitol complex and in the House Chamber\u201d and emphasized that there will be a \u201czero-tolerance policy for disturbances in the building.\u201d In a scathing statement announcing she would not attend the speech, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the only Palestinian America member of Congress, called Netanyahu \u201ca war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people.\u201d \u201cIt is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress. He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court,\u201d Tlaib added. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, another one of the lawmakers to skip Netanyahu\u2019s speech, told CNN, \u201cI just don\u2019t think we should be listening to a one-way lecture from Netanyahu when he\u2019s had a failed strategy on the board.\u201d Even some Jewish lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California are not planning on attending. \u201cI\u2019m not attending the Netanyahu address because I don\u2019t want to condone his behavior over the last 10 months,\u201d Jacobs told CNN. \u201cI think Israel\u2019s security is incredibly important. I have family who live there. But what Netanyahu has done, how he has prosecuted this war, what he has been doing in the West Bank does not actually make Israel any safer.\u201d Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told CNN that instead of attending the address, she gave her tickets to family members of the hostages being held. Leading up to Netanyahu\u2019s arrival, Jewish Voice for Peace staged a 300-person sit-in to protest Netanyahu\u2019s appearance and the decision from congressional leadership to meet with him. \u201cThis is a war criminal that nobody, not a single one of our elected officials should be meeting with Netanyahu,\u201d JVP communications director Sonya Meyerson-Knox told CNN. \u201cAnd in fact, what we are demanding from our elected officials is to actually do everything they can to get to a ceasefire to save lives.\u201d House Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee\u2019s office had to call US Capitol Police for help after protestors swarmed his office, which resulted in several arrests. \u201cHundreds of protesters outside the office became disruptive, violently beating on the office doors, shouting loudly, and attempting to force entry into the office,\u201d Kildee\u2019s chief of staff, Mitchell Rivard, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe U.S. Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms responded immediately to the incident and have made several arrests. Congressman Kildee is safe and his staff are all accounted for.\u201d Capitol Police are preparing for a large coalition protest led by Palestinian groups to surround the Capitol on Wednesday in anticipation of Netanyahu\u2019s arrival.

{"id": "2024_07_23_politics_kamala-harris-burchett-dei-hire-backlash", "text": "In the first full day of her presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris swiftly earned enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination and raised a historic $81 million. And yet, less than 24 hours after Harris formally launched her bid for the White House, some Republicans zeroed in on a line of attack: her race. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Manu Raju Monday, Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett suggested President Joe Biden selected Harris as his running mate solely because she is Black: \u201cOne hundred percent she is a DEI hire,\u201d he said, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201cHer record is abysmal at best.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar strategy to political analysts who say Burchett\u2019s comments echo tactics Republicans used during the 2008 election to drive the conspiracy around Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, and caution that it could be a sign of what\u2019s to come along the already turbulent road to Election Day. \u201cThere\u2019s been this constant debate about mediocrity versus meritocracy. The truth is for most of American history, White men were the only people who were ever considered, it didn\u2019t matter if they were mediocre,\u201d said Democratic strategist Keith Boykin, who likened this moment to the Republican \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d of the 1960s, where politicians relied on racial grievance to drive White voters to the polls. \u201c(Meritocracy) became a part of the conversation when Black people, and women, and people of color and queer people started to enter into the workforce and society in public ways. And suddenly there became this assumption that anybody who wasn\u2019t a straight White man didn\u2019t deserve to be there.\u201d Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson later addressed Burchett\u2019s remarks during a news conference Tuesday, calling for the election to be about\u00a0\u201cpolicies, not personalities.\u201d \u201cThis is not personal, with regard to Kamala Harris, and her ethnicity or her gender had nothing to do with this whatsoever. This is about who can deliver for the American people and get us out of the mess that we\u2019re in.\u201d When diversity becomes a slur The backlash to Burchett\u2019s remarks was swift, with many noting that the suggestion Harris could somehow be unqualified or mediocre because of her race traded on familiar racist tropes about women of color \u2013 especially Black women \u2013 in the workplace. Before becoming the vice president, Harris had a decades-long career as a prosecutor and was elected to be San Francisco\u2019s district attorney and later California\u2019s attorney general. She then won California\u2019s 2016 US Senate race, becoming the\u00a0state\u2019s first Black and South Asian senator before being elected vice president in 2020. But Harris\u2019 experience doesn\u2019t appear to matter to those who would rather rely on identity politics to sway voters, said Boykin, co-founder of the National Black Justice Coalition and author of the book \u201cWhy Does Everything Have to Be About Race?\u201d \u201c(Obama) was a United States senator, a former state senator and a constitutional scholar and a best-selling author and they claimed he wasn\u2019t qualified. But then they picked Donald Trump, who had no experience in government, and they don\u2019t even say anything about his qualifications,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cKamala Harris, who was a former district attorney, former attorney general, former United States senator and current vice president is a \u2018DEI hire\u2019 in their minds, just because she\u2019s a Black woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you couldn\u2019t get more transparent than that.\u201d Burchett\u2019s comments \u201chave turned the value of diversity into a slur,\u201d Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina Democratic state representative and a CNN political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people are really prepared to see what this campaign is going to be and the depths of hell that many Republicans are going to go to, to sully the spirit and soul of Kamala Harris, not knowing that she\u2019s the fighter that she is.\u201d A strategy that could backfire Continued attacks on Harris\u2019 race or gender could ultimately backfire against Republicans, according to Glynda Carr, president of Higher Heights for America, a political organization dedicated to engaging Black women in politics. In the 72 hours since Biden endorsed Kamala Harris to replace him on the top of the Democratic ticket, Black women and men across the country have rallied around her candidacy. Tens of thousands of Black Americans joined Zoom calls Sunday and Monday to unite around the campaign to #winwithBlackwomen and #winwithBlackmen. Collectively, the calls raised more than $2.8 million dollars for Harris, according to organizers. Burchett\u2019s remarks are \u201cenergizing the very voters that Vice President Kamala Harris needs to win,\u201d Carr said. \u201cShe is a woman who has run and won and governed on every level of government and is credentialed from her academic background to her lived experiences. So, continue to push that rhetoric and see how women, women of color, and Black women react \u2026 and how we will organize against that very destructive and false narrative.\u201d Ultimately, Boykin said, Harris\u2019 record speaks for itself and any suggestion that she\u2019s a \u201cDEI hire\u201d is a distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to point the finger at immigrants, at Black people, at women \u2026 or anybody who is different instead of dealing with the issues that they\u2019re elected to solve,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cHow does attacking Kamala Harris as a \u2018DEI hire\u2019 help to create a single job? How does it tackle inflation? \u2026 It\u2019s this divide and conquer mentality that they are going to use to prevent us from coming together.\u201d Harris appeared undeterred by the remarks during her first presidential campaign rally Tuesday afternoon in Milwaukee. Instead, as she reintroduced herself to the nation for the first time as the Democratic Party\u2019s presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, the vice president touted her experience as both a prosecutor and a politician. \u201cIn those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type,\u201d Harris said to a swell of cheers. \u201cAnd in this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/kamala-harris-burchett-dei-hire-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In response to bipartisan demands for answers, we are announcing a House Task Force made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats to thoroughly investigate the matter,\u201d the two leaders said in a statement. The task force, which Johnson told Fox News last week would be forthcoming, will have subpoena power, the statement said. Its goals will be to understand the security failures that led to the shooting, to seek accountability and to prevent such an attempt from happening again. The House will vote on a resolution later this week to establish the task force and its members, and it will be comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats, the statement said. Congress has moved swiftly to investigate the security failures that led to the shooting on July 13. On Monday, US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle was grilled at length by the House Oversight Committee, and she has faced numerous calls from Hill lawmakers, including Johnson, to resign.
