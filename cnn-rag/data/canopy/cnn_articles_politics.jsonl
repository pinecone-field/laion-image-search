A senior administration official said Friday that the two men were likely to discuss the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and climate change. The pope, who is making history this week by becoming the first pontiff to attend a G7 gathering, also sat down with the group of world leaders to discuss, among other things, finding an ethical framework to underpin the development and use of AI, CNN previously reported. Deepfake images of the pope wearing a white puffer jacket went viral last year. The president is a lifelong practicing Catholic who met with the pope in 2021 in a visit to Italy. After that audience with the pope, Biden told reporters he discussed \u201ca lot of personal things\u201d with the pontiff and that the meeting was \u201cwonderful.\u201d The 2021 meeting with the pope came amid an effort by some Catholic bishops to deny Biden communion over his stance on abortion. In 2019, Biden was denied communion at a South Carolina church because of his support for abortion rights. But during that meeting, the pope assured Biden that he was a good Catholic and should continue receiving communion rites, Biden later told other leaders. \u201cWe just talked about the fact he was happy I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving communion,\u201d Biden said as he was greeting then-Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in Rome. At one point during that meeting, Biden presented the pope with a memento that carried deep personal significance: a coin that bore the insignia of the 261st Signal Brigade, the Delaware National Guard unit in which his late son Beau served as a captain. \u201cI know my son would want me to give it to you,\u201d Biden said. Per CNN\u2019s count, Friday will mark the fifth time Biden has met with this pope. The pope also visited the United States in the months following the president\u2019s son Beau\u2019s death in 2015 \u2013 and held a private meeting with Biden and his extended family in Pennsylvania. The pope, who is 87 years old and has experienced poor health in recent months, also met separately with a number of other leaders in southern Italy, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/biden-pope-francis-g7/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_abortion-agenda-donald-trump", "text": "Few issues epitomize the astonishing nature of Donald Trump\u2019s political success as much as abortion. Over the past two decades, his public statements on one of the most divisive American cultural issues have swung like a pendulum. Trump has compared his shift on abortion to that of Republican icon and former President Ronald Reagan. It was an evolution that by Election Day 2016 had driven Trump into making unprecedented promises to anti-abortion advocates and allies. And then he won. And he delivered. A New York businessman and reality television star who was once an unabashed supporter of abortion rights became, in Trump\u2019s own words, \u201cthe most pro-life president in American history.\u201d It\u2019s the rare statement from the former president that draws vigorous agreement from supporters and vehement critics alike. Trump\u2019s three Supreme Court appointments are the reason Roe v. Wade is no longer in place. Since the high court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision, hundreds of lower-court Trump nominees are helping shape the legal landscape in an intensifying battle that has already had significant electoral effect: State-level ballot initiatives have almost uniformly resulted in positive outcomes for abortion rights supporters and, by extension, Democrats. For Trump, who has carefully tended to the anti-abortion Christian conservatives who form a cornerstone of his most dedicated supporters, the political realities have forced the appearance of a recalibration to mitigate any political risk. After months of public intrigue and internal campaign deliberations on whether to support a nationwide abortion ban, Trump settled on an official position that carried with it echoes of his vacillation in years prior. \u201cThe states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\u201d Trump said in an April recording posted to his Truth Social platform. The position, which Trump has reaffirmed relentlessly since, marked a departure from his past support for a nationwide prohibition at 20 weeks and a rejection of anti-abortion groups pushing for a more restrictive ban. It was in large part driven by a recognition of the electoral danger a hard-line approach to abortion poses, three people who spoke to Trump about the issue told CNN. \u201cThis motivates Democrats like nothing else,\u201d one of them said. \u201cHe sees it and isn\u2019t going to fall into that trap.\u201d The delicate political balance Trump is trying to strike was on full display throughout this week. Speaking to a Christian group that has vowed to \u201ceradicate\u201d abortion, Trump expressed his support but delivered only brief, pre-taped remarks that did not include the word \u201cabortion.\u201d A few days later, he was explicit in his warnings about the political risks in closed-door remarks with Republicans on Capitol Hill, which came the same day the Supreme Court rejected an effort by anti-abortion groups to restrict access to the abortion drug mifepristone . Trump urged the GOP lawmakers not to run away from the abortion debate, a posture that he said cost Republicans as many as 40 seats in the midterm elections, one source in the room told CNN. \u201cRepublicans are so afraid of the issue,\u201d Trump said, according to the source. He emphasized the importance of supporting exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother \u2013 a call to neutralize Democratic attacks that have framed his party as \u201cextreme\u201d on reproductive rights. Yet Trump\u2019s position is hardly as clear-cut as he\u2019s presented it. While championing the right of states to pass their own regulations, he has assailed blue states that have enacted abortion protections and criticized restrictions on the procedure in Republican-led states such as Florida and Arizona that he said went too far. It\u2019s just another example of a rhetorical strategy Trump deploys with great skill on complex or politically inflammatory issues, giving himself space to change or backtrack if politically necessary. When it comes to abortion, however, it\u2019s a strategy that presents complications. Trump, after four years in office, has a record. Delivering on his promises Supporters of a national abortion ban acknowledge that even if Trump backed such a ban, the prospects of it getting through Congress would be remote. After all, Trump \u2013 again, the \u201cmost pro-life president in American history\u201d \u2013 didn\u2019t have much in the way of anti-abortion legislative wins during his first term. Instead, what he had were senior officials at key agencies with funding, legal and policy authority, who were unapologetically anti-abortion and sought ways to drive the administration in that direction. Trump, former officials told CNN, was committed to delivering on his campaign promises to a critical block of voters, and like-minded administration officials were given wide latitude to push policy changes. Those same supporters, while expressing disappointment in his decision not to back a nationwide ban, have made clear they will continue to aggressively push for Trump to deliver on their policy priorities. Key anti-abortion leaders, all critical to Trump\u2019s base of Republican support, have warned against any changes this summer to the party\u2019s platform that calls on Congress to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks and for an amendment to the US Constitution giving the unborn the same rights as a person. Trump may chafe at the political risks of a hard-line abortion stance now, but a win in November could change the calculus. The circle of former officials who would be likely to join a second Trump administration and run point on the agencies responsible for federal policy on the issue share near universal anti-abortion views. Even if Trump moved only to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s wave of executive actions on abortion access and reimplement his own first-term actions, the effect would likely be far greater in the absence of federal protections for the procedure. Among Trump allies, there\u2019s no expectation he\u2019d follow a different path from the one trod during his first four years. \u201cHe\u2019s a pro-life president,\u201d former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News days after Trump released his statement on Truth Social. \u201cI believe he\u2019ll be a pro-life president in the future also.\u201d Many senior Trump administration alumni and allies are now mapping out and drafting policy options for a second Trump term. Most are not affiliated with the campaign, which has sharply pushed back against the constellation of powerful outside groups created to develop policy and personnel options for a second term. But those groups are expected to hold significant influence should Trump win in November. One of them, Project 2025, which is housed in the conservative Heritage Foundation, has drafted a nearly 1,000-page policy book for the next Republican administration. The view on abortion policy is clear: \u201cThe Dobbs decision is just the beginning.\u201d That statement, which is echoed by powerful and well-funded anti-abortion advocacy groups, cuts to just how much Trump\u2019s current stance leaves unanswered. Trump has yet to address how his administration would interpret the Comstock Act, an 1873 anti-vice law that many in the anti-abortion movement see as a way to potentially ban the procedure in all 50 states. Biden\u2019s Justice Department issued a 2022 legal memo stating that the law did not bar mail delivery of abortion medication unless sent with intent for illegal use. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between saying \u2018This is a states\u2019 rights issue\u2019 and \u2018This 1873 law is a backdoor ban on illegal abortion-related items that can be enforced in blue states against doctors, drug companies and patients on Day One,\u2019\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who supports abortion rights and closely tracks the legal and policy history of the issue. \u201cThat\u2019s a night-and-day difference in terms of what he thinks policy should be.\u201d The Comstock Act is just one in an arsenal of tools the anti-abortion movement would like to see a second Trump administration employ to restrict, if not totally ban, abortion nationwide, without going through Congress. Initial actions Roger Severino, a former top Trump Health and Human Services official who drafted the chapter on the department for the Project 2025 policy book, told CNN that a second Trump administration would set out to rescind all of Biden\u2019s abortion access actions and restore and expand all of Trump\u2019s first-term policies. The Project 2025 plan details steps Trump could take immediately to limit access to abortion within the first days of being back in office through executive action and by personnel changes in key agencies such as HHS, the Food and Drug Administration and the DOJ. Among the abortion actions that Trump has vowed to reimplement and reenforce is reviving the so-called Mexico City policy. The Reagan-era rule restricts foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive assistance from the US from providing abortion services or information. Under an expansion of the policy under Trump, groups were barred from providing any abortion care, even with non-US funds, lest they risk losing American support altogether. It was one of several key anti-abortion actions the Trump administration executed on the global stage. Biden rescinded the policy in his first days in office. A second Trump term would also put back in place and expand restrictions on Title X grants \u2013 federal funds for public and nonprofit groups that provide family planning. While that funding is already barred from being used to pay for abortion clinics, the Trump administration\u2019s restrictions sharply curtailed the number of providers who utilized the program \u2013 by more than 25%, per some estimates provided by abortion rights groups. \u201cHis first term was disastrous for reproductive rights and freedoms \u2014 including devastating changes to Title X which left far too many people without access to essential sexual and reproductive health care,\u201d Julie Lewis, the director of public policy at Planned Parenthood Votes, told CNN. \u201cA second term would be catastrophic for freedom and liberty.\u201d The Trump administration also took several actions to undermine the Affordable Care Act, which provides coverage for preventative services and birth control for millions of women, and it slashed hundreds of millions of dollars from the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program at the HHS. Resurrecting these actions in a second Trump would almost entirely be up to the discretion of whomever he appoints to lead the relevant federal agencies. Pushing harder than before Having loaded the federal courts with more than 200 conservative judges and three Supreme Court justices, there would be fewer \u2014 and lower \u2014 roadblocks for Trump to get abortion restrictions on the books. \u201cThe courts would be unlikely to obstruct, or less likely to obstruct anti-abortion policy coming out of the Trump administration,\u201d said Ziegler of UC Davis. With Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections erased, anti-abortion activists would like a second Trump administration to push harder than it did before \u2013 especially in restricting access to mifepristone. The medication is used in roughly two-thirds of abortions nationwide and was at the center of the Texas case the Supreme Court decided this week. Even though the Court rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill, the decision left the door open for a future Trump administration to limit access unilaterally. Trump could direct the FDA to reverse its approval of the drug, and he could revive his administration\u2019s mandate that women seeking an abortion receive the pill from providers directly, not through the mail. But the single greatest threat to mifepristone would come not from new policies Trump could enact but from the 19th-century law his administration could choose to enforce. \u201cThe biggest concern is not that he\u2019ll repeat anything he did the first time,\u201d Drexel University law professor David S. Cohen told CNN. \u201cBut it\u2019s that he will put people in place this time who will have a very strict interpretation of the Comstock Act.\u201d The law held no weight in the 50 years that Roe held sway, but now it\u2019s up to the White House and the Justice Department to decide whether to enforce it, and to what extent. An anti-abortion administration could choose to prosecute anyone who sends or receives mifepristone by mail, or they could go so far as to restrict the mailing of any of the supplies used in surgical abortions \u2013 an effective total ban on the procedure, even in states that have enacted protections. \u201cA few years ago, most people would not have believed the threat of the Comstock Act was at all legitimate,\u201d said Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, which brought many challenges to anti-abortion policies during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cBut the threat of politicization of the Department of Justice and lack of regard for people\u2019s rights and the law is real and we must be prepared to confront it.\u201d Mark Lee Dickson is the founder of the Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn initiative, which has lobbied local governments to effectively outlaw all forms of abortion through enforcing the Comstock Act. He told CNN the law represented the best path for anti-abortion activists to totally end abortion in America and he would like to see its enforcement at a federal level. \u201cPerhaps President Donald J. Trump will be the president that brings an end to abortion in America as we know it,\u201d Dickson said. \u201cHe\u2019s already made much more progress than any president in the United States on this issue so far.\u201d Dickson has worked closely with former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell to draft and defend his local ordinances. Mitchell is best known as the legal mind behind SB 8 \u2013 the restrictive abortion ban in Texas he helped enact before Roe v. Wade was even overturned. More recently, the conservative lawyer and anti-abortion activist has taken on a new client: Trump. Mitchell was Trump\u2019s principal attorney in his battle to stay on the primary ballot in Colorado, defending the former president before the Supreme Court this past February. Abortion rights advocates worry he could play an outsize role shaping abortion restrictions in a potential second Trump administration. When pressed in April on whether a future Trump administration would seek to regulate mifepristone, Trump told Time magazine he had \u201cpretty strong views\u201d on the issue and would be making an announcement \u201cprobably over the next week.\u201d That announcement hasn\u2019t come as yet. People familiar with the matter say that there was never any intention of releasing a statement and that Trump was simply going back to his oft-used way of avoiding a question. But if Trump\u2019s position on a national abortion ban is any indication, it\u2019s unlikely he will come down firmly on the side of anti-abortion advocates during the presidential campaign. As he said in his video announcement in April, one thing matters above all else. \u201cWe must win,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to win.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/abortion-agenda-donald-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_hunter-biden-joe-biden", "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday offered his first public remarks about his son Hunter\u2019s conviction on federal gun charges earlier this week, telling reporters in Italy he is \u201cproud\u201d of him and accepts the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of my son Hunter. He has overcome an addiction, he\u2019s one of the brightest, most decent men I know,\u201d Biden said during a news conference on the margins of the G7 summit. \u201cI am satisfied that I\u2019m not going to do anything \u2014 I said I\u2019d abide by the jury decision. I will do that. And I will not pardon him,\u201d he added. Hunter Biden was found guilty on three federal charges this week, punctuating an emotionally tumultuous trial that unearthed many dark and private moments for the Biden family. Biden reaffirmed that he would not pardon his son, echoing a commitment he made last week, before he was convicted in his gun case. The president also went a step further Thursday, saying he would not consider commuting his son\u2019s sentence. Presidents have the power both pardon and commute, or reduce, sentences in federal cases. Hunter Biden has not yet been sentenced in his gun case, and it likely will not happen for another couple of months. White House officials suspected the president may face questions from reporters at Thursday\u2019s press conference regarding his son\u2019s conviction, including whether the president would commute the sentence, a senior White House official told CNN. Biden aides suspected there was a good chance the president would be asked to comment on the verdict, the official said, and they were sensitive to the fact that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\u2019s response to a question the day before had inadvertently created fresh headlines that the White House would not rule out the possibility of a commutation. But the official told CNN that Jean-Pierre\u2019s response had simply been a reflection of the fact that some aides had not discussed that matter with the president. The president has sought to draw a distinction between his own acceptance of the jury\u2019s verdict and rival Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his own legal issues amount to a \u201crigged\u201d justice system. To that end, he has largely chosen to stay quiet about his son\u2019s criminal trial. Last week, the president in a statement noted that while he is the commander-in-chief, he is also a father. He repeated those sentiments in a statement after his son\u2019s conviction on Tuesday. While Biden has largely shied away from talking about his son\u2019s criminal case in an effort to avoid looking like he is putting his thumb on the scale, other family members had shown up to support Hunter Biden in court. First lady Dr. Jill Biden was in the courtroom for most of the trial, making several transatlantic flights to be by Hunter Biden\u2019s side while the first family was in France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. The president\u2019s siblings, Valerie and James, also appeared in court to support Hunter Biden. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_trump-milwaukee-horrible-democrats", "text": "Democrats are seizing on Donald Trump\u2019s characterization of Milwaukee as a \u201chorrible\u201d city, attempting to make the former president pay politically for dissing the most populous part of a key swing state \u2014 and one that will host Republicans\u2019 national convention in July. \u201cIn a state that\u2019s decided on a razor\u2019s edge, that may ultimately cost Donald Trump the election,\u201d Cavalier Johnson, the Democratic mayor of Wisconsin\u2019s largest city, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Thursday night. The Democratic National Committee said Friday it was launching 10 billboards across the city featuring Trump\u2019s comments. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign immediately began selling T-shirts and stickers with images of Wisconsin, with Milwaukee\u2019s location marked on them, and the words: \u201c(Not) a Horrible City.\u201d The party\u2019s top figures, meanwhile, took to social media to highlight the former president\u2019s remarks, which were reportedly made during a closed-door meeting Thursday with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Biden posted a photo showing him holding a Milwaukee Bucks jersey alongside team members who visited the White House after winning the NBA championship in 2021. \u201cI happen to love Milwaukee,\u201d Biden wrote. And Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, wrote on social media: \u201cAdd it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about,\u201d followed by a clown emoji. As Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues in his meeting with House Republicans on Thursday, the former president called Milwaukee \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. The Trump campaign pushed back on the characterization of his remarks. \u201cHe never said it like how it\u2019s been falsely characterized as. He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are,\u201d campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Thursday on social media. The Democratic billboards feature Trump\u2019s comment as reported by Punchbowl News\u2019 Jake Sherman, who broke the news Thursday. Sherman posted on social media that Trump had said: \u201cMilwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\u201d The comment quickly gained traction in Wisconsin, a state that has been among the most competitive in presidential elections in recent years. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s banner headline Friday featured the remark. \u201cTrump: Milwaukee \u2018horrible,\u2019\u201d it read. Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold \u2014 one that Trump and his allies have long cited, without evidence, as a city rife with election fraud. Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington \u2014 the so-called \u201cWOW counties\u201d \u2014 have long formed a red collar around the blue city. However, the suburban portions of those counties have mirrored national shifts during the Trump era, with Democrats making gains that have eaten into those counties\u2019 previously huge Republican margins. Trump is set to visit Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign event next week, where he could address the reports about his closed-doors remarks about Milwaukee. Some Republican lawmakers who were present denied hearing Trump\u2019s comment. \u201cNo, that is not at all what I heard,\u201d Florida Rep. Cory Mills said Friday on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d He said multiple GOP members of Congress were present and did not agree with that account. \u201cNone of us heard that,\u201d Mills said, explaining that it was possible the word \u201chorrible\u201d was used in a different context. Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin, who was in the room Thursday, made clear to CNN that Trump was \u201cspecifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\u201d and not the city itself. Johnson, the Milwaukee mayor, told CNN that the city was pulling itself \u201cout of issues around crime that raged after the pandemic.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer, Melanie Zanona and Annie Grayer \u00a0contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/trump-milwaukee-horrible-democrats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_media-outlets-use-deceptively-edited-video-to-claim-biden-wandered-off-at-g7-summit", "text": "Right-wing media outlets used a deceptively cropped video to misleadingly claim President Joe Biden wandered off during an event with other world leaders at the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday. Video shared by the New York Post on X showed part of a skydiving demonstration in front of several world leaders in Italy that involved several parachutists landing near the group, with each skydiver carrying a flag representing the different G7 countries. In the full, unedited video, Biden \u2013 who was standing with the group of leaders as a parachutist carrying a G7 banner landed in front of them \u2013 briefly turned away to give a thumbs-up to several parachutists who had landed behind the group, along with a parachute rigger who was kneeling on the ground to pack up one of the skydiver\u2019s chutes and the French flag. Other leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, also briefly look toward that group. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni then walks toward Biden, taps him on the arm, and motions for him to join the other leaders who were being briefed by an Italian Army officer about the demonstration they just watched. But the video shared by the Post on X cropped out the kneeling parachute rigger, omitting the context of why Biden walked away from the group. \u201cPresident Biden appeared to wander off at the G7 summit in Italy, with officials needing to pull him back to focus,\u201d the social-media post said. That claim later became the basis of the Post\u2019s Friday front page, which called Biden the \u201cMEANDER IN CHIEF\u201d and accused the president of embarrassing the US with \u201cconfused wanderings.\u201d The White House on Thursday criticized the Post and outlets for characterizing the president as \u201cconfused\u201d and for using an \u201cartificially narrow frame\u201d to make it appear as if the president was wandering off from the skydiving demonstration. \u201cHe\u2019s saying congratulations to one of the divers and giving a thumbs up,\u201d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a post on\u00a0social media. \u201cBeware cheap fakes \u2026 and all the bad faith actors who post them,\u201d White House communications director Ben LaBolt\u00a0also posted. X later added a community note to the Post\u2019s tweet acknowledging the video had been cropped. A spokesperson for the Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Edited video goes through conservative echo chamber The video of Biden at the skydiving demonstration appeared to have first been flagged by the Republican National Committee, which posted the uncropped video of Biden giving the parachutists a thumbs-up shortly after the demonstration took place. The New York Post shared the cropped version less than 90 minutes later. Other right-wing outlets quickly followed suit. Sinclair stations posted stories saying Biden appeared to wander away at the summit. Those\u00a0stories\u00a0also resurfaced false claims that the president soiled himself at a D-Day ceremony in France earlier this month. A Fox & Friends segment Friday morning reported on the incident and the Post\u2019s front page, with a chyron saying the president appeared \u201cconfused\u201d at the summit. Other world leaders who attended the event with Biden, though, pushed back on the idea that he was confused. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was standing just steps away from Biden, said the president \u201cwas being very polite and went over to talk to all of (the skydivers) individually.\u201d \u201cGiorgia was saying don\u2019t worry they\u2019re all coming \u2013 we were meant to line up and they were coming to shake our hands,\u201d Sunak said,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Telegraph. Cropped video plays on concerns over Biden\u2019s age While emerging technologies like artificial intelligence continue to proliferate and create concern about the impact that misinformation will have on voters ahead of November, the video shared by the Post shows that relatively low-tech efforts, like cropping videos to show Biden out of context, can still be powerful tools to reinforce the idea that the 81-year-old president has lost control of his mental faculties. Every day that Biden is president, he sets a new record as the oldest person to ever hold that office. He would be 86 at the end of a potential second term. And recent events, including special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report that described the president being portrayed as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and recent Biden missteps where he appeared to confuse long-dead world leaders with their living contemporaries, have served to reinforce those concerns. The White House has pushed back on criticism over Biden\u2019s age by pointing toward his packed travel schedule. In just the last two weeks, the president has traveled to France to commemorate D-Day, back to the United States to comfort a son who just became a convicted felon and then embarked on another transatlantic journey to Italy, where he participated in high-stakes discussions about future US support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. From there he heads straight to California to participate in a star-studded fundraiser. The rest of this month will see Biden preparing for his critical June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, who turned 78 on Friday and is also scrutinized for his age. Biden\u2019s campaign and his family members have said his age and the experience that comes with it are an asset to his role, and not a liability.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_larry-hogan-trump-maryland-senate", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he \u201cwould like to see\u201d Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan win his election in November,\u00a0according to a Fox News reporter who interviewed Trump on Thursday. Trump spoke with the reporter in Washington, DC, amid meetings with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He told the reporter he wanted to see Hogan, a former Maryland GOP governor, defeat Democratic nominee Angela Alsobrooks, according to a social media post by the reporter. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him win. I think he has a good chance to win. \u2026 I know other people made some strong statements, but I can just say from my standpoint, I\u2019m about the party and I\u2019m about the country. And I would like to see him win,\u201d Trump said, according to Fox News. According to a clip of the interview aired by Fox News on Thursday, Trump was asked if he was endorsing Hogan. \u201cWell, nobody\u2019s asked me that, but essentially, I would be endorsing him, yeah,\u201d the former president said. In a statement reacting to Trump\u2019s endorsement, Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said, \u201cGovernor Hogan has been clear he is not supporting President Trump just as he didn\u2019t in 2016 and 2020.\u201d Hogan and Alsobrooks are vying for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin. Democrats were expected to easily hold the seat in the deep-blue state, which last elected a Republican senator in 1980. But the entrance of Hogan, a popular two-term former governor, gave the race a jolt, and polling has shown him running competitively against Alsobrooks. Trump\u2019s reported comments come after Hogan urged Americans to \u201crespect the verdict\u201d in the former president\u2019s New York hush money trial shortly before it was delivered. Trump was subsequently found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The former president\u2019s allies reacted harshly to Hogan\u2019s statement. Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita responded in a\u00a0social media post: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with CNN shortly after the verdict, Republican National Committee co-chair and Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law\u00a0Lara Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Hogan \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve the respect\u201d of any Republicans and called the former governor\u2019s comments \u201cridiculous.\u201d Hogan, however, has continued to criticize the former president, telling CNN that a Trump versus Joe Biden matchup was a \u201cterrible choice\u201d and that he wouldn\u2019t vote for either man.\u00a0\u201cI know that sounds like a cop-out, but I just don\u2019t think either one of them should be president,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump loses this election, I think that will be the end of the movement. And I think we\u2019ll try to get the party steered back to a more Reaganesque, bigger-tent party that can win elections by appealing to a broader audience of people,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIf Trump wins, then, you know, we\u2019re going to see how long that movement will be successful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/larry-hogan-trump-maryland-senate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed over and over this year that Iran was so impoverished because of his policies as president that it did not provide any money to terror groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. \u201cIran was, as you know, they were broke. They weren\u2019t funding Hamas, and they weren\u2019t funding anything. They weren\u2019t funding Hezbollah,\u201d Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May interview with right-wing host Dan Bongino. In a June interview with Phil McGraw, the personality known as Dr. Phil, Trump\u00a0claimed Hamas would have never perpetrated its October attack on Israel if he had still been president, \u201cbecause Iran was broke and Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hamas and they weren\u2019t funding any of the terrorists \u2013 Hezbollah, all of them,\u00a0there\u2019s like 28 of them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hezbollah, Hamas or any other terror group during his presidency is false. Iran\u2019s funding for such groups\u00a0did\u00a0decline\u00a0in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his\u00a0sanctions\u00a0on Iran had a\u00a0major negative impact\u00a0on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN this week. Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah.\u00a0 Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups\u00a0(though it\u2019s\u00a0unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his\u00a0years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements. Pompeo said Iran continued to fund terror in 2020. Experts agree Research institutions in the US and Israel have reported that Iran\u2019s financial relationship with Hamas\u00a0actually\u00a0grew\u00a0stronger\u00a0in 2017, the first calendar year of Trump\u2019s presidency, after several years of frostiness related to divisions between Tehran and Hamas over the war in Syria. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in\u00a0late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d But\u00a0Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. \u201cSo you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically \u2013 continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,\u201d Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a\u00a0transcript posted on the State Department\u2019s website. Earlier that week, during a visit to Israel, Pompeo\u00a0told reporters\u00a0that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to limit the money the Iranian regime has available to inflict harm around the world \u201chas borne fruit, it has been successful,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay at it. There is still work to do on that file as well.\u201d He said, \u201cEven during this pandemic, the Iranians [are] using the ayatollahs\u2019, the regime\u2019s, resources to foment terror across the world\u00a0even when the people of Iran are struggling so mightily.\u201d Four experts told CNN this week that Iran\u2019s funding for Hezbollah and Hamas never vanished under Trump. \u201cIt absolutely did not and has not,\u201d said\u00a0Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cDefinitely it didn\u2019t stop. It decreased, yes,\u201d said\u00a0Hanin Ghaddar, senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cI would say it slowed down, but it never stopped entirely,\u201d said\u00a0Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group. \u201cIran has never ceased funding many of its core proxy groups\u201d such as Hezbollah, said\u00a0Phillip Smyth, who\u00a0studies Iran\u2019s proxies. \u201cThey are hyper-focused on continuing these relationships and proxy building efforts. However, sanctions do take a toll on some of their operations/abilities to build proxies.\u201d A funding cut, but funding continued Iran does not disclose how much money it gives to Hezbollah, Hamas and other foreign armed groups. Brian Hook, who served as the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran under Trump,\u00a0claimed\u00a0in 2019 that Iran \u201chas provided Hezbollah almost $700 million annually and gave more than $100 million a year to Palestinian terrorist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\u201d Hook\u00a0declined in June 2020\u00a0to publicly say how much less money Iran was spending on foreign activities than it had before Trump launched the pressure campaign, but he pointedly noted media reports about Iranian proxies receiving less than they had before.\u00a0Pompeo also\u00a0touted this reduction\u00a0in August 2020. In 2019, The Washington Post\u00a0published an in-depth report\u00a0explaining that, because Iran\u2019s financial situation had been worsened by Trump policy, Hezbollah had \u201cseen a sharp fall in its revenue and is being forced to make draconian cuts to its spending, according to Hezbollah officials, members and supporters.\u201d Reuters\u00a0published a report in 2020\u00a0about how Iran had slashed its payments to Shiite militia groups in Iraq because of the impact of the US sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Iran reduced its publicly disclosed military budget under Trump. The\u00a0Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which monitors countries\u2019 military spending,\u00a0reported\u00a0that Iranian military spending declined 20% between 2018 and 2020. Still, there\u2019s no doubt Iran\u2019s unspecified spending on foreign armed groups continued to some significant extent even after these cuts. The State Department\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0on international terrorism in 2020 made clear that Iranian support for terror entities endured in the last calendar year of Trump\u2019s term. \u201cIran continued to support acts of terrorism regionally and globally during 2020. Regionally, Iran supported proxies and partner groups in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, including Hizballah and Hamas,\u201d the report, released in 2021, said. \u201cSenior (al Qaeda) leaders continued to reside in Iran and facilitate terrorist operations from there. Globally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force remained the primary Iranian actors involved in supporting terrorist recruitment, financing, and plots across Europe, Africa, and Asia, and both Americas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_supreme-court-bump-stocks", "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a federal ban on bump stocks approved by former President Donald Trump, the latest opinion from the conservative court rolling back firearm regulations. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for a 6-3 court. The court\u2019s liberal wing, led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented. Trump had pushed for the ban in response to a 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute. \u201cA bump stock does not convert a semiautomatic rifle into a machinegun any more than a shooter with a lightning-fast trigger finger does,\u201d Thomas wrote in his opinion. \u201cEven with a bump stock, a semiautomatic rifle will fire only one shot for every \u2018function of the trigger.\u2019\u201d The ban was challenged by a Texas gun store owner, Michael Cargill, who purchased two of the devices in 2018, turned them over to the government after the prohibition was implemented and then promptly sued to get them back. The federal rule made possession of a bump stock a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Though the case didn\u2019t rely on the Second Amendment, it did put the debate about guns back on the court\u2019s docket in one of the most closely watched controversies this year. In that sense, the decision was the latest from the high court to side with gun rights groups. President Joe Biden said in a statement later Friday that the ruling \u201cstrikes down an important gun safety regulation.\u00a0Americans should not have to live in fear of this mass devastation.\u201d Sotomayor reads dissent from the bench Sotomayor wrote in a scathing dissent joined by the court\u2019s other two liberal justices that the majority\u2019s ruling \u201cwill have deadly consequences.\u201d The decision, she wrote, \u201chamstrings the Government\u2019s efforts to keep machineguns from gunmen like the Las Vegas shooter.\u201d In a move that underscored Sotomayor\u2019s discontent with the court\u2019s ruling, the justice took the rare step of reading her dissent from the bench on Friday. \u201cWhen I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \u201cA bump-stock-equipped semiautomatic rifle fires \u2018automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u2019 Because I, like Congress, call that a machinegun, I respectfully dissent.\u201d Gun control groups decry \u2018shameful decision\u2019 A number of gun control advocacy groups argued Friday that the court\u2019s ruling will have a dangerous impact in a country constantly reeling from gun violence. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen bump stocks cause immense destruction and violence,\u201d\u00a0said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, an attorney with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cCongress must act to undo the damage and make clear that bump stocks, and all automatic conversion devices, are illegal under federal law.\u201d The pro-gun safety group Brady United similarly denounced the ruling, saying in a statement on X: \u201cBump stocks essentially turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. Weapons of war should have no place in our communities.\u201d And Everytown for Gun Safety argued that the high court \u201chas put countless lives in danger.\u201d The group said in a statement that lawmakers in Washington \u201ccan and should right this deadly wrong.\u201d Groups that opposed the ban argued that the federal government never had the power to ban the devices without Congress\u2019s approval. Randy Kozuch, the head of the National Rifle Association\u2019s legislative arm, said on Friday that the court \u201chas properly restrained executive branch agencies to their role of enforcing, and not making, the law.\u201d Mark Chenoweth, president of the New Civil Liberties Alliance, the group that represented Cargill, also applauded the decision. \u201cThe statute Congress passed did not ban bump stocks, and ATF does not have the power to do so on its own,\u201d Chenoweth said. \u201cThis result is completely consistent with the Constitution\u2019s assignment of all legislative power to Congress. Bump-stock opponents should direct any views at Congress, not the Court, which faithfully applied the statute in front of it.\u201d From Capone to the Supreme Court The bump stock challenge was tied indirectly to a gun control law Congress enacted in the 1930s that was intended to target gangsters like Al Capone and John Dillinger. Responding to grisly crimes in which machine guns were used to rob banks or ambush police, lawmakers required owners to register those weapons. The law was amended several times and, by 1986, it prohibited Americans from transferring or possessing a machine gun altogether in most circumstances. Importantly, the amended law defined \u201cmachine gun\u201d as a weapon that fires more than one round with \u201ca single function of the trigger.\u201d What, precisely, that phrase meant was the focus of the appeal. Both the Trump and Biden administrations, as well as gun control groups, said the way bump stocks work mean they qualify as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reclassified the devices as machine guns in 2018 and, based on the earlier law, barred people from buying or owning them. Trump described bump stocks at the time as converting \u201clegal weapons into illegal machines.\u201d ATF estimated that as many as 520,000 bump stocks were sold between 2010 and 2018. The device replaces a semiautomatic rifle\u2019s regular stock, the part of a gun that rests against the shoulder. It lets shooters use the recoil of the weapon to mimic automatic firing if they hold their trigger finger in place. Opponents say the ATF overstepped its authority with the reclassification. They noted that the agency under both Democratic and Republican administrations had long said the devices were not covered by the law. A US District Court in Texas and a panel of three judges on the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Justice Department. But the full 5th Circuit reconsidered the case and issued a fractured opinion last year siding with Cargill. The court appeared split during oral arguments in late February. Several of the court\u2019s conservatives were concerned, in particular, with the idea that Americans who purchased bump stocks when they were not classified as machine guns could suddenly be prosecuted for a crime they were not aware of. Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried that the criminalization of the device would \u201censnare\u201d Americans. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not aware of the legal prohibition, you can be convicted,\u201d Kavanaugh told the attorney representing the Biden administration. \u201cThat\u2019s going to ensnare a lot of people who are not aware of the legal prohibition.\u201d Another central theme of the arguments was the question of whether Congress \u2014 rather than the ATF \u2014 should have approved the ban. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s emerged as a central theme at the Supreme Court in recent years, with groups challenging financial and environmental regulations in separate cases. The court, meanwhile, has repeatedly sided with some of the same gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, that opposed the bump stock ban. Most recently, the court\u2019s conservative majority invalidated a New York state law that required state residents to have a special need to carry a weapon outside of their homes. Thomas includes graphics of how bump stocks work In an opinion that reflected the technical nature of the case and the oral arguments in February, Thomas\u2019 opinion digs deeply into the mechanics of semi-automatic rifles \u2013 including with a series of graphics demonstrating what happens when triggers are depressed. \u201cFiring multiple shots using a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock requires more than a single function of the trigger,\u201d Thomas wrote, underscoring the idea that the devices are not the same thing as an automatic weapon where a shooter simply holds down a trigger. \u201cToo much forward pressure and the rifle will not slide back far enough to release and reset the trigger, preventing the rifle from firing another shot. Too little pressure and the trigger will not bump the shooter\u2019s trigger finger with sufficient force to fire another shot,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cWithout this ongoing manual input, a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock will not fire multiple shots. Thus, firing multiple shots requires engaging the trigger one time \u2014 and then some.\u201d GOP lawmakers celebrate court\u2019s ruling The overwhelming majority of House Republicans celebrated the court\u2019s decision on Friday, arguing that they long believed it was unconstitutional. Despite the fact the action was taken under the Trump administration, many Republicans argued it was the wrong move at the time. \u201cIt vindicates the rights of gun owners,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz told CNN. \u201cI think there was a lot of misinformation about bump stocks. I think responsible gun ownership enhances safety.\u201d Texas Rep. Chip Roy also praised the ruling, saying the ban \u201cwas a bad rule, just like the pistol brace is a Biden-era rule, which is a bad rule.\u201d \u201cThere are definitional issues on the trigger,\u201d Roy added. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had a really strong case in the first place. Obviously, it\u2019s a strong statement and in still continuing to protect, support Second Amendment rights \u2014 so I\u2019m glad the court did it.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/supreme-court-bump-stocks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters", "text": "Hunter Biden has never sought elective office or been part of a presidential administration, but he has loomed large in the American political conversation for years. His conviction in Delaware, the first federal criminal trial of a president\u2019s son in US history, is for allegedly lying on a federal firearms background check and owning a firearm for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs and could land him behind bars. It has put a personal drama of addiction and betrayal in the public eye, an unwanted embarrassment for the Biden family. Read more from CNN\u2019s team covering the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, his brother\u2019s widow \u2013 with whom he had an affair \u2013 and his daughter all testified. Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction will also serve as a sort of foil for former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction for lying on business records in New York. That\u2019s not to equate the two sets of charges or the trials. Trump was convicted for hiding his compensation of hush money paid to keep an alleged affair out of the media during the 2016 presidential campaign. He is also running again in the 2024 presidential election, while Hunter Biden is now an artist. Hunter Biden also faces tax evasion charges in Los Angeles later this year, another case brought by the former Trump-appointed US attorney turned special counsel whose planned plea deal with Biden to settle both the gun and tax problems imploded last year when a Trump-appointed judge refused to accept it. Trump feared a Joe Biden candidacy ahead of the 2020 election, and hoping to tarnish Biden\u2019s reputation, in 2019 he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to spin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. Trump pushed Zelensky to focus on Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as vice president, at a time when Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. Joe Biden was one of many Western leaders who had advocated for the ouster of a prosecutor in Ukraine because he was not pursuing corruption cases. Read a CNN fact check about Trump\u2019s Ukraine claims. Democrats impeached Trump (the first of two times) for improperly dragging a foreign leader into US politics. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. But that bad experience did nothing to stop Trump or Republicans from making allegations about Hunter Biden. At the Republican presidential debate in 2020, Trump brought up Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and also alleged that he was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the Navy Reserve for cocaine use, which is not true. Hunter Biden was administratively discharged, which is standard procedure when an officer fails a drug test. Read a CNN fact check about the discharge claim. In fact, if you search \u201cHunter Biden\u201d in the CNN Facts First database, there are many results. Among them: Did Hunter Biden have a job before his father became vice president? Yes. Did Joe Biden profit from his son Hunter\u2019s career? There\u2019s no evidence. What is Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with China? He did business with Chinese partners. The sheer volume of these fact checks is worth noting as proof, if nothing else, that he is so frequently cited by his father\u2019s political opponents.  When Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives in January 2023, one of their high-profile moves was to launch an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, most of it built on trying to tie the president to his son\u2019s former business career. While House Republicans have referred Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden for criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading Congress, the impeachment inquiry has seemingly fallen apart without unanimous support from Republicans and no evidence of wrongdoing by the president. For Hunter Biden, his name is both a blessing and a curse. It was with help from his last name that he built a lucrative career as an attorney, then lobbyist, who then  did business with companies in Ukraine and China. It is because of his name that he has been so scrutinized. It is a trade-off Hunter Biden has been experiencing for years. When Joe Biden was tapped as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008, they made a point about not consorting with lobbyists. Hunter, then a lobbyist, ended his lucrative lobbying contracts a few months before the election that year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_isis-us-fears-terror-attack", "text": "The recent arrest\u00a0of eight Tajik nationals believed to have connections to ISIS has heightened\u00a0concerns among national security officials that a dangerous affiliate of the now-splintered terror group could potentially carry out an attack on US soil, according to multiple US officials who spoke to CNN. Members of the group initially entered the US at the southern border and requested asylum under US immigration law. It\u2019s unclear whether they entered at the same time and place. By the time intelligence collected on overseas ISIS targets connected the men to the terror group, they had already been vetted by immigration authorities and allowed into the country, officials said. Though there is no hard evidence indicating they were sent to the US as part of a terror plot, at least some of the\u00a0Tajik nationals\u00a0had expressed\u00a0extremist\u00a0rhetoric in their communications, either on social media or in direct private communications that US intelligence was\u00a0able to monitor, three officials said. That discovery\u00a0set off a flurry of emergency investigative efforts by federal agents and analysts across the country, sources said, including physical and electronic surveillance of the men \u2014\u00a0a counterterrorism operation reminiscent of the years immediately following 9/11, when the FBI investigated numerous homegrown plots. After\u00a0a period of\u00a0surveillance, federal officials in recent days faced a difficult decision: whether to continue surveilling the men in order to determine if they were part of any potential plot or wider terrorist network, or to move in and take them off the street. Rather than risk the worst-case scenario of a potential attack, senior US officials decided to move in and have the men apprehended by ICE agents, one source told CNN. The men remain in federal custody on immigration charges and will eventually be deported following the counterterror investigation into them. Tajiks recruited by ISIS Of particular concern to US officials was that the men hail from Tajikistan, a corner of Central Asia that in recent years has been a source of steady recruitment by ISIS-K, the Afghanistan-based affiliate of the Islamic terrorist group. ISIS-K is led primarily by Tajiks, who have carried out a series of recent attacks in Europe on behalf of the group, including the Crocus Hall attack in Moscow in March that killed more than 100 people. National security officials fear\u00a0that at least some of the eight Tajiks were ripe for radicalization by ISIS-K while they were inside the United States, potentially struggling with isolation, financial stress or discrimination \u2014 all things that could make a person susceptible to ISIS propaganda glorifying violence. Senior officials now see a so-called \u201clone-wolf\u201d attacker who emerges seemingly from nowhere as perhaps the more likely \u2014\u00a0and potentially equally dangerous \u2014\u00a0threat, rather than the more traditional coordinated plot carried out by trained operatives. Compared to terror networks, whose communications can provide possible avenues for surveillance exploitation, lone individuals who do not telegraph their attack plans to anyone present an additionally difficult challenge for security officials. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume it\u2019s not all of the above,\u201d said one senior US official. \u201cWe\u2019re too early to know everything we want to know about the depth and texture of the links that might be there\u201d between these eight people and ISIS. The episode comes as senior intelligence officials have been publicly warning that global conditions have put the risk of a terror attack on US soil at its highest level in recent memory \u2014\u00a0at the same time that many national security officials also acknowledge that American drawdowns in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East have reduced intelligence-gathering on traditional terrorism threats. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that since our drawdowns in various places around the world, we collect less intelligence. This was always a tradeoff we knew we were making,\u201d\u00a0the senior US official said. Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell this week co-wrote a widely circulated piece in Foreign Affairs warning that terrorism warning lights are \u201cblinking red,\u201d\u00a0echoing a\u00a0recent warning\u00a0by FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said he sees \u201cblinking\u00a0lights everywhere I turn.\u201d \u201cThe combination of stated intentions of terrorist groups, growing capabilities they have demonstrated in recent successful and failed attacks around the world, and the fact that several serious plots in the United States have been foiled, point us to an uncomfortable but unavoidable conclusion,\u201d the Foreign Affairs piece read.\u00a0\u201cPut simply, the United States faces a serious threat of a terrorist attack in the months ahead.\u201d Gaps in intelligence collection Intelligence officials are keenly aware of gaps in intelligence collection in Afghanistan, where ISIS-K is primarily based. While officials believe that ISIS-K mainly tries to radicalize and inspire attackers rather than train and field operatives, the group\u2019s rise to prominence is a relatively new phenomenon. That means that there is much that US counterterrorism analysts don\u2019t know about its strategy, recruitment efforts and operational tactics. US officials and analysts who closely track Islamist terror groups do know that ISIS-K has dramatically ramped up its online propaganda machine. Rather than training and deploying fighters \u2014\u00a0as al Qaeda did in the 9/11 attacks, for example \u2014\u00a0ISIS-K has instead focused on radicalizing vulnerable populations. Tajikistan, for example, is one of the poorest countries in the world and its population faces extreme religious repression, both factors that terrorism experts say can make a population vulnerable to radicalization. Colin Clarke, a researcher who specializes in terrorism, said the group is creating \u201ccharismatic propaganda\u201d to reach \u201cout to diasporas that are already in place in Europe, in North America and in the region in Central Asia, and attempting to inspire people to conduct attacks.\u201d \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s just a matter of time before they\u2019re able to pull something off successfully,\u201d Clarke said. Concerns about the border The arrests also puts a spotlight on vulnerabilities at the US southern border, an issue Republicans have amplified in the midst of a presidential election year. \u201cWe are literally living on borrowed time,\u201d Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said from the Senate floor on Wednesday during a speech about the threat of terrorists entering the US through the southern border. A June 7 report released by the DHS inspector general found that asylum seekers were not always screened in a timely fashion and that border agents could not access all the federal data they needed to vet noncitizens seeking admission into the US. The US is \u201cat risk of admitting dangerous persons into the country or enabling asylum seekers who may pose significant threats to public safety and national security to continue to reside in the United States,\u201d the report said. US officials have been paying particular attention to immigrants from Central Asian countries including Tajikistan since last summer, when a group Uzbek nationals who had crossed the southern border were later found to have been assisted in traveling to the United States by a facilitator who had ties to ISIS. The episode sparked a scramble across the US government to locate and investigate those people. Two US officials also said that it spurred national security officials to ensure that immigration and intelligence authorities were appropriately monitoring anyone traveling from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. \u201cI think what [the incident with the Uzbek nationals] did last summer was suggest central Asians are potentially a population of concern, given what we know about the global ISIS network right now,\u201d the senior US official said. In 2023, CBP reported 169 encounters with individuals identified as \u201cpotential matches\u201d with names on the terrorism watch list. But that\u2019s not necessarily a reliable gauge of the number of actual terrorists who may be trying to enter the United States, US officials argue. When a name pings on a terror watch list, it could mean any number of things: a person could have a very loose, attenuated connection to a known terrorist. Or they could belong to a legacy terror group \u2014\u00a0like the FARC \u2014 that isn\u2019t known for conducting attacks on US soil. Or they could simply have a similar name as a person of legitimate concern. That\u2019s what happened with the Jordanian national who was arrested at the gates of the US Marines base at Quantico earlier this year, two US officials said. Although his name returned a hit against one of the watch lists, it turned out to be a \u201cbad match,\u201d according to the senior US official. The blending of criminality and terrorism in poor countries \u2014\u00a0like Tajikistan \u2014 can also prove incredibly difficult for law enforcement officials to unravel. A person may have regular contact with a family member who has done some paid work for ISIS, for example, without themselves sharing any sympathy for the group. But, Clarke said, the risk is there: \u201cCrushing poverty [and] an extremely religious population that\u2019s suppressed by its leaders \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s almost a perfect formula for exporting jihadists.\u201d Said one law enforcement source: \u201cIt\u2019s become clich\u00e9, but remains absolutely true: We may be done with ISIS, but ISIS isn\u2019t done with us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/isis-us-fears-terror-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-plane-ethics-supreme-court", "text": "Justice Clarence Thomas took several more trips on the private plane of GOP megadonor Harlan Crow than\u00a0were\u00a0previously known, a top Senate Democrat revealed Thursday. According to information obtained by Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, Thomas traveled on Crow\u2019s private jet during trips in 2017, 2019 and 2021 between various US states, as well as on a previously known\u00a02019 trip to Indonesia, during which Thomas also stayed on Crow\u2019s mega-yacht. The newly revealed private plane trips\u00a0add to the picture of luxury travel\u00a0enjoyed by Thomas and bankrolled by friends of the justice who have ties to conservative politics.  Thomas has come under fire for his failure to include such trips on financial disclosure forms the justices release each year, though he and his defenders argue that he followed the court\u2019s disclosure rules as they were understood at the time. The revelation was likely to add to the tension between the high court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have been pushing for more than a year for tighter ethics rules. A series of ethics scandals involving Thomas and, more recently, Justice Samuel Alito, have left public approval of the court at historic lows. Last year, amid stories\u00a0by\u00a0ProPublica\u00a0on the justice\u2019s jet-setting lifestyle,\u00a0the federal judiciary\u2019s policy-making body said\u00a0that\u00a0travel on private planes should be reported by the justices\u00a0closing a\u00a0loophole that Thomas said had exempted him from reporting the \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d he had received form his uber-wealthy friends. The court\u2019s critics argue that the current understanding of the disclosure rules\u00a0should apply\u00a0retroactively. Thomas, through a court spokeswoman,\u00a0did not respond to a CNN inquiry\u00a0about the new revelations and why the trips were not disclosed. He previously said that he was advised at the time that he was not required to disclose the hospitality he received from the Crows, but that he intended to follow the recent changes to the guidance going forward.\u00a0His defenders have pointed to a 2012 letter from the Judicial Conference, which administers the regulations for judges\u2019 financial disclosures, that cleared him of claims at the time that he should have been reporting his trips with Crow. Last week, with the release of his financial disclosures for 2023,\u00a0Thomas said\u00a0he had \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d from previous financial filings\u00a0a hotel stay paid by the\u00a0Crows during the 2019 trip to Indonesia and\u00a0his accommodations that same year at a private club they are members\u00a0of in Monte Rio, California. Yet he did not disclose his travel on Crow\u2019s private plane for\u00a0either\u00a0of\u00a0those trips that was revealed by Durbin. In addition to that trip, according to the documents released by\u00a0Durbin, Thomas traveled on Crow\u2019s plane from St. Louis to Montana and then on to Dallas in 2017;\u00a0on a 2019 round trip from\u00a0Washington, DC, to Savannah, Georgia; and on a 2021 round trip from Washington, DC, to San Jose, California. \u201cThe Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s ongoing investigation into the Supreme Court\u2019s ethical crisis\u00a0is producing new information - like what we\u2019ve revealed today - and\u00a0makes it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment,\u201d Durbin said in a statement that pointed to Supreme Court ethics legislation put forward by Senate Democrats. A procedural maneuver by Durbin on Wednesday to pass the bill on the Senate floor was blocked by Republicans. Elliot Berke, an attorney for Thomas, said the trips Senate Democrats called attention to on Thursday fell under the \u201chospitality exemption.\u201d Thomas and others have previously said they understood the disclosure rules to exclude situations involving \u201cpersonal hospitality.\u201d \u201cConsequently, and as Justice Thomas has already explained, he and many other federal judges were advised that they were not required to report gifts of personal hospitality from friends who did not have business before the Court,\u201d Berke told CNN. Mark Paoletta, a former top Trump administration official and prominent Thomas ally, similarly said on X that Thomas disclosed the hotel and private club stays from the previous trips because they were not covered under the personal hospitality exemption \u2013 even before the 2023 changes to the disclosure guidance. He argued that a justice\u2019s stays on a friend\u2019s \u201chome, planes\u201d and \u201cboats\u201d were exempted under the rules until the 2023 revision. Durbin and other Democrats launched probes into gifts and lavish travel Thomas\u00a0received after a bombshell ProPublica report that detailed the Indonesia trip with Crow \u2013 during which Thomas and his wife Ginni Thomas stayed on Crow\u2019s 162-foot yacht \u2013 and other extravagant trips that the Thomases took with Crow and Crow\u2019s wife. Crow \u2013 whom Thomas has described as among his family\u2019s \u201cdearest friends\u201d \u2013 has said that he has never talked\u00a0to Thomas about matters in front of the judiciary. \u201cMr. Crow reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide information responsive to its requests going back seven years,\u201d Crow spokesperson Michael Zona said of the information revealed Thursday. \u201cDespite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning\u00a0to resolve the matter. As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow,\u201d Zona added.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-insulin-costs", "text": "President Joe Biden is\u00a0campaigning on\u00a0his success in getting seniors with diabetes a $35-per-month cap on their insulin spending. But his Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump,\u00a0claimed Saturday\u00a0that Biden has actually done nothing to lower insulin costs and that\u00a0Biden is taking credit for Trump\u2019s own accomplishment. \u201cLow INSULIN PRICING was gotten for millions of Americans by me, and the Trump Administration, not by Crooked Joe Biden. He had NOTHING to do with it,\u201d Trump wrote on social media. \u201cIt was all done long before he so sadly entered office. All he does is try to take credit for things done by others, in this case, ME!\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that Biden did nothing to lower insulin costs and \u201cit was all done\u201d before Biden became president are both false. Trump did get a $35-per-month cap on insulin for some seniors, through\u00a0a voluntary program\u00a0that Medicare prescription drug plans could choose to participate in. But Biden ensured that all 3.4 million-plus insulin users on Medicare got $35-per-month insulin \u2014 through a mandatory cap that not only covers more people than Trump\u2019s voluntary cap but also applies to a greater number of insulin products and stays in effect at a level of individual drug spending at which Trump\u2019s cap disappeared. Trump could fairly say he\u00a0played a role\u00a0in lowering insulin costs and that Biden does not deserve\u00a0sole\u00a0credit. The Biden-era federal government has acknowledged that Biden\u2019s mandatory $35 monthly cap, signed into law in his Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,\u00a0\u201cclosely aligns with\u201d the voluntary $35 monthly cap in the Trump-created program that was announced in 2020 and launched in the final month of the Trump presidency in 2021. But Trump\u2019s claim that Biden deserves no credit at all is inaccurate. Biden\u2019s policy goes beyond Trump\u2019s policy in multiple ways. Asked for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson provided an emailed statement that asserted Biden had replaced Trump\u2019s insulin cap with a \u201cweaker\u201d policy. But after CNN outlined the ways Biden\u2019s policy is demonstrably stronger than Trump\u2019s, and asked how it could reasonably be considered \u201cweaker,\u201d the Trump campaign did not reply further. Biden\u2019s policy was passed by Congress and signed into law, making its future more secure than the Trump initiative\u00a0that was created without new legislation and that was\u00a0described as a five-year test. And here are four substantive ways Biden\u2019s policy does more than Trump\u2019s did. 1: Biden\u2019s policy applies the $35-per-month cap to every insulin user in Medicare Part D. Trump\u2019s policy didn\u2019t Biden\u2019s policy, which took effect in 2023, requires\u00a0every\u00a0prescription drug plan in Medicare Part D to provide each insulin prescription for no more than $35 per month. Conversely, in 2022, 38% of Part D prescription drug plans chose to sign up for the\u00a0voluntary\u00a0Part D Senior Savings Model\u00a0program initiated by Trump, according to data provided to CNN by\u00a0Juliette Cubanski,\u00a0deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at health policy organization KFF.\u00a0Only \u201cenhanced\u201d plans were allowed in, not basic plans. The federal Centers for\u00a0Medicare & Medicaid Services told CNN that in 2022, before Biden\u2019s policy took effect, more than 800,000 people with diabetes in Part D were eligible for $35-or-less insulin through the program initiated by Trump. And some substantial additional number of\u00a0seniors,\u00a0which is not publicly known, were paying $35 or less per month for reasons other than that Trump program. Regardless, Biden made $35-per-month insulin universal for seniors with diabetes. Trump did not. 2: Biden\u2019s policy applies the $35 cap to Medicare Part B. Trump\u2019s policy didn\u2019t Biden\u2019s policy\u00a0imposes the mandatory $35 monthly cap on insulin taken via a pump, which is obtained through Medicare Part B. Under Trump\u2019s program, the voluntary $35 monthly cap only applied to insulin obtained via Medicare Part D drug plans, such as insulin that is injected or inhaled. \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act, which the American Diabetes Association supported, expanded and made permanent the cost-sharing limits for insulin users enrolled in\u00a0all\u00a0Medicare Part D plans and those who take insulin under Part B,\u201d the association said in an email, underlining the word \u201call.\u201d 3: Biden\u2019s policy requires a $35 cap on all covered insulin products. Trump\u2019s policy only\u00a0required it on some Biden\u2019s policy applies the $35 monthly cap to all insulin products covered by Part D prescription drug plans. Under Trump\u2019s program, even the drug plans that volunteered to participate\u00a0could\u00a0choose to\u00a0apply\u00a0the $35 monthly cap to just one particular vial product and one particular pen product of each insulin type\u00a0(rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting and long-acting). If a senior happened to use a different product that was not designated for the $35 cap, they\u00a0would have to switch products\u00a0if they wanted to benefit from the cap.\u00a0Cubanski and KFF colleagues\u00a0wrote in 2020: \u201cMaking this switch could be difficult for insulin users who have been stabilized on a particular insulin medication (or medications) and for whom consistency in treatment is important in managing diabetes.\u201d 4: Biden\u2019s policy eliminates insulin payments for patients at the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level of drug spending. Trump\u2019s $35 cap didn\u2019t exist at the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level Under Biden\u2019s policy, people in Medicare Part D\u00a0no longer\u00a0have to make any payments\u00a0for covered prescription drugs, including insulin, once they reach a very high level of annual drug spending known as the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level. Under Trump\u2019s voluntary insulin program, the $35 monthly cap\u00a0was\u00a0no longer in effect\u00a0after people reached the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d threshold, though many people likely paid less than $35 per month for insulin at that point regardless. In addition, starting in 2025, Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act imposes a $2,000 annual cap on overall out-of-pocket drug spending for people in Medicare Part D.\u00a0The\u00a0American Diabetes Association said it was \u201cvery pleased\u201d by this overall cap: \u201cAn established annual out-of-pocket maximum can provide significant economic relief to individuals living with diabetes who are more likely to require multiple prescription medications.\u201d Looking forward: Biden wants to expand the $35 cap; Trump\u2019s position is unknown After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the country\u2019s three largest insulin manufacturers\u00a0instituted\u00a0price caps or launched savings programs that lowered the cost of the drugs to $35 for many patients not in Medicare and slashed the list prices of their products. Biden is\u00a0calling\u00a0to extend the mandatory $35 monthly cap to Americans with private health insurance. In 2022, a proposal to do that\u00a0failed in the Senate\u00a0because of opposition from most Republican senators. It\u2019s not clear where Trump stands on the future of insulin policy; his campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s request to clarify. But he has called the future of the Inflation Reduction Act as a whole\u00a0into doubt\u00a0by repeatedly\u00a0criticizing\u00a0the law and some of its\u00a0key provisions,\u00a0vowing\u00a0to pause \u201call new spending grants and giveaways\u201d under the law, and broadly\u00a0declaring he will terminate\u00a0Biden\u2019s environmental policies, some of which are contained in the law.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-insulin-costs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Timothy Muller, 43, is charged with making interstate threats and influencing, impeding or retaliating against a federal official.\u00a0If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. While court documents do not name the FBI agent who was the target of\u00a0the\u00a0threats, a person familiar with the matter told CNN the agent is a member of special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team investigating the president\u2019s son. An attorney for Muller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has not yet entered a formal plea in court. The charges come as the Justice Department and federal agents report increased violent threats \u2013 many of which are related to high-profile investigations and prosecutions like that of Hunter Biden. Attorney General Merrick Garland lambasted the rise of \u201cbaseless, personal and dangerous\u201d threats in a \u00a0Washington Post op-ed\u00a0Tuesday, saying that department employees are being \u00a0\u201cthreatened for simply doing their jobs.\u201d Muller\u2019s alleged threats against the FBI\u00a0agent appear to fall into that category. According to court documents, Muller called the FBI\u00a0agent hours after a Delaware federal jury found President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter guilty of three felony gun charges. In a minute long voicemail, Muller allegedly threatened to kill the agent and their family, saying, \u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t f**king hide.\u201d The message continued with lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen, according to court documents, and expletive-laden threats, saying that \u201cthe guns will come out, and we\u2019ll hunt you\u201d down \u201cand slaughter you like the traitorous dogs you are in your own f**king homes.\u201d Mueller then allegedly followed up in several texts to the agent\u2019s phone, writing, \u201cHow\u2019s the family?

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_john-roberts-recording-what-matters", "text": "The funny thing about \u201csecret\u201d recordings made of public figures is that they generally confirm what everyone already knew. The propriety of liberal activist Lauren Windsor pretending to be a religious conservative in order to surreptitiously record Supreme Court justices attending a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society can certainly be debated. The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In a preliminary injunction issued Thursday, US District Judge Terry Doughty blocked the Biden administration from implementing the new federal protections for LGBTQ+\u00a0students \u2013 which are set to take effect August 1 \u2013 in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho. A separate ruling Friday by a federal appeals court upheld an existing block on federal guidance seeking to\u00a0protect transgender students\u00a0and workers in 20 states. The case Doughty ruled in is one of more than half a dozen challenging new\u00a0changes to Title IX, the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid. Among other things, the changes aim to curb discrimination \u201cbased on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics,\u201d\u00a0according to the Department of Education. \u201cThe Department crafted the final Title IX regulations following a rigorous process to realize the Title IX statutory guarantee,\u201d department spokesperson Vanessa Harmoush said in a statement after Doughty issued his ruling. \u201cThe Department stands by the final Title IX regulations released in April 2024, and we will continue to fight for every student.\u201d The new rules require schools to protect students from all sex discrimination, including sexual violence and sex-based harassment, expanding that definition to include discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions like childbirth, termination of pregnancy\u00a0or recovery from pregnancy. Compliance with the new rules is required to receive federal education aid. The lawsuit brought by the GOP-led\u00a0states argues that the Biden administration overstepped its authority. The plaintiffs are asking Doughty, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, to strike down the rules nationwide. LBGTQ+ advocates have argued that Thursday\u2019s ruling will have a \u201cdangerous\u201d impact on members of the community in the four states. \u201cToday\u2019s decision prioritizes anti-LGBTQ+ hate over the safety and well-being of students,\u201d Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said in a statement. \u201cThis is MAGA theatrics with the dangerous goal of weaving discrimination into law.\u201d Appeals court maintains block on federal protections for trans students and workers The 2-1 ruling issued Friday by the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals upholds a preliminary injunction issued nearly two years ago by a federal judge in a case brought by GOP states against federal guidance intended to\u00a0protect transgender students\u00a0and workers in 20 states. The ruling allows the 20 states to continue enforcing\u00a0controversial laws\u00a0without risk of retaliatory action from the administration, including the loss of federal funding for schools. The guidance, issued by the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is designed to protect transgender individuals from a slew of anti-trans policies, including bans from school sports teams, bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity, and measures that allow employers to intentionally refuse to use a worker\u2019s preferred pronouns. \u201cTaken together, the States are trapped between choosing to enforce state laws or receiving federal funds, all while having to investigate gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination (unlike before),\u201d Circuit Judge John Nalbandian wrote in the majority opinion, which was joined by Judge Joan Larsen. Both judges were appointed by Trump. \u201cStates with conflicting laws will be hampered in their ability to enforce their laws, and the States will continue to face pressure to change their laws to avoid legal consequences,\u201d Nalbandian wrote. In dissent, Circuit Judge Danny Boggs said he would have wiped away the preliminary injunction and thrown the case out altogether. The judge said he didn\u2019t believe the plaintiffs had the legal right \u2013 known as \u201cstanding\u201d \u2013 to bring the challenge in the first place. The states that brought this challenge are: Tennessee, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/biden-title-ix-protections-blocked-gop-states/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_jill-biden-age-campaign-trail", "text": "First lady Dr. Jill Biden is hitting the campaign trail on a double mission this week, courting older voters to support her husband\u2019s reelection bid while also tackling voters\u2019 concerns about his age. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about stopping an extremist, and this election is most certainly not about age,\u201d the first lady said at an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin. \u201cJoe and that other guy are essentially the same age. Let\u2019s not be fooled. But what this election is about, it\u2019s about the character of the person leading our country.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is a healthy, wise 81-year-old ready and willing to work for you every day to make our future better,\u201d she added. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it.\u201d Her remarks came at her first stop of a three-day campaign swing through Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Nevada and Arizona. The campaign has deployed the first lady to help boost support among older voters, a group that has typically voted Republican in presidential elections but has shifted toward President Joe Biden in this year\u2019s contest. Age has proven to be an inescapable issue in the rematch between two seniors \u2013 Biden, 81, and former President Donald Trump, who turned 78 on Friday. But the first lady is using her unique position as a spouse of the oldest president in US history and a senior herself \u2013 she turned 73 last week \u2013 to speak of the benefits of aging and appeal to an important voting bloc. \u201cThe woman I am today is wiser, stronger, more insightful and more confident than I was all those years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery line on my face has been earned by the furrowed brows of difficult decisions made. By the\u00a0sun of countless roads traveled, by the sweet strain of deep laughter with the people I love. Age is a gift.\u201d The first lady has emerged as perhaps the most active surrogate for her husband\u2019s campaign. She\u2019s jetted around the country for political events and fundraisers in the past year while juggling her duties at the White House and in the classroom. Her campaign schedule is expected to pick up even more in the summer months and heading into the fall. Dr. Biden also has fully embraced a role as a forceful critic of her husband\u2019s predecessor. \u201cMake no mistake, Donald Trump is dangerous to our livelihoods, to our security, and the future of our country,\u201d the first lady said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. She\u2019s lambasted\u00a0Trump over his treatment of women and his stance on reproductive rights. In an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d last month, she spoke starkly of the contest between her husband and his predecessor, arguing voters will \u201cchoose good over evil\u201d in November. This week\u2019s campaign push comes as Dr. Biden continues to balance her responsibilities as a top surrogate for her husband\u2019s campaign with her role as a key support system for her family as they grapple with the legal and emotional fallout from her son Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction on three felony gun charges. The first lady devoted much of the past week and a half to providing in-person support for her son. She sat a few feet behind Hunter in the courtroom through most of the trial as the sordid details of his struggles with addiction and a turbulent period in the family\u2019s history were aired out in a Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom. After less than three hours of deliberation, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three charges on Tuesday, a chain of events that moved with such speed that the first lady did not make it to court in time to hear the decision read. Dr. Biden arrived within minutes, and after meeting with her son, family and allies inside the courthouse, she walked out of the building hand-in-hand with Hunter in a public show of solidarity. President Biden made a last minute trip to Wilmington a few hours later to be at his family\u2019s side, tightly embracing his only living son on the tarmac shortly after Marine One touched down in Delaware. \u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that,\u201d the president said in a statement after the verdict was announced. The first lady has yet to comment on Hunter\u2019s conviction and is unlikely to discuss it unprompted. Instead, she\u2019ll spend the next few days trying to keep the focus on her work to reelect her husband. The first lady\u2019s travel this week is part of the campaign rollout of \u201cSeniors for Biden,\u201d an organizing effort aimed at turning out voters 65 and older. Trump won voters 65 or older by five percentage points in 2020, according to CNN exit polls. But recent surveys have shown a swing in support among older voters toward Biden. At the same time, the campaign\u2019s efforts to draw in seniors come amid signs of a narrowing of the president\u2019s support in other key parts of his coalition, including young, Black and Latino voters. The first lady kicked off her swing Thursday with stops in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. On Friday, she\u2019ll speak at another seniors-focused event in Reno, Nevada, with actress and activist Jane Fonda, and attend a fundraiser in Los Gatos, California. She\u2019ll continue the swing on Saturday with an event in Phoenix, Arizona. Advisers believe the president\u2019s pitch on strengthening Social Security and Medicare and lowering prescription drug costs along with the need to protect democracy resonates with older voters as they make their contrast arguments against Trump. The Biden campaign is looking for creative ways to mobilize those voters over the age of 65 heading into November. They\u2019ve organized pickleball tournaments, bingo games, pancake breakfasts and ice cream socials across key states this week. The first lady is betting those efforts will pay off. \u201cNo, we cannot be defined by a number. And when people underestimate us, they do it at their own risk,\u201d the first lady said in Duluth on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s show what these years can do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/jill-biden-age-campaign-trail/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The attorneys continued, comparing the request to the gag order Trump is under in a separate case in New York, adding, \u201cLike Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Smith seeks to restrict President Trump\u2019s campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month.\u201d In late May, attorneys for Smith asked the judge presiding to \u201cmake clear\u201d that Trump cannot \u201cmake statements that pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents participating in the investigation and prosecution of this case.\u201d The heart of their concern, prosecutors wrote, was Trump\u2019s \u201cfalse and inflammatory statements\u201d when he claimed that FBI agents were ready to shoot him and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d during the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. The former president was in New York at the time. Trump\u2019s claims, based on the FBI\u2019s plan for the search \u2013\u00a0which was provided to the defense in discovery \u2013 are entirely false, prosecutors wrote, adding that Trump has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search, as the bureau does with \u201ccountless\u201d warrants that it executes. The FBI and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both said the policy is normal and was also in place during the search of President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware residence during the investigation into his handling of classified information. In the filing Friday, Trump\u2019s attorneys said prosecutors have not submitted \u201cany evidence of threats or harassment resulting from President Trump\u2019s protected speech.\u201d \u201cNot a single FBI agent who participated in the raid submitted an affidavit, or even an argument, claiming that President Trump\u2019s remarks put them at risk,\u201d his attorneys wrote. Prosecutors\u2019 original ask for a gag order was thrown out by Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, who determined that they had not fully conferred with Trump\u2019s attorneys before filing the request. Trump\u2019s false claims \u201cinvite\u201d threats and harassment against law enforcement agents involved in the case, prosecutors wrote, similar to those \u201cthat have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/trump-gag-order-classified-documents-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Though technical, the court\u2019s reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Medication abortion\u00a0accounts for nearly two-thirds of all US abortions, according to some estimates.\u00a0The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy, and it has been shown to be safe and effective. The pill is also often prescribed for miscarriage treatment. Here\u2019s what to know about the ruling: Plaintiffs had no standing The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the opinion, said the parties do not have standing \u201csimply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities \u2014 at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-regulation of others.\u201d Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone \u2014 the first drug in the medication abortion process \u2014 is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. Biden blames GOP for allowing challenge to abortion access President Joe Biden cast blame on Republicans for the very existence of the case, taking aim at GOP elected officials\u2019 \u201cextreme and dangerous agenda\u201d on reproductive rights. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid. Meantime, former President Donald Trump cautioned Republicans not to go too far on abortion in a meeting with the House GOP conference. The big picture Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement. But the court\u2019s technical reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Much of the opinion covered the various legal thresholds a plaintiff must reach to make it appropriate for courts to intervene in a dispute. In addition, the Supreme Court is yet to release a decision on a case related to abortions in health emergencies. The justices will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have\u00a0strict bans on abortion.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_senate-ivf-bill-vote", "text": "Senate Republicans\u00a0voted Thursday\u00a0to block\u00a0a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide. The legislation failed to advance in a procedural vote by a tally of 48-47.\u00a0It needed 60 votes to advance.\u00a0Republicans criticized the Democrat-led legislation as\u00a0unnecessary overreach and a political show vote. \u201cWhy should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There\u2019s not a problem. There\u2019s no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\u201d Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters. The vote is part of a broader push by Senate Democrats to draw a contrast with Republicans over reproductive health care in the run up to the November elections. Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Republicans who voted against the bill, saying that they are being \u201cpushed by the MAGA hard right.\u201d \u201cThese are the very same people who pushed to get rid of Roe in the Dobbs decision,\u201d Schumer told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d Thursday evening, referring to the blockbuster 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned a constitutional right to abortion. \u201cWe know what they\u2019re up to. They want to get rid of IVF, they\u2019re afraid to say it.\u201d Biden attacked Senate Republicans after the vote. \u201cOnce again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\u201d Biden said in a written statement. \u201cAnd just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman\u2019s right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as\u00a0unnecessary overreach and a political show vote. The legislation the Senate will take up \u2013 the Right to IVF Act \u2013 would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access. The bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans\u2019 health care. The IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The vote comes after Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death \u2013 a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on\u00a0infertility treatments. While the state\u2019s legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation. Southern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \u201cdestruction of embryonic human life.\u201d The IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception. Most Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill. Republicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception.\u00a0GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act\u00a0and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has\u00a0put forward\u00a0a separate bill to promote access to contraception. Cruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort. Murray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \u201cenact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\u201d Under the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \u201cpermits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\u201d according to a press release. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. CNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer, Sam Fossum and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_biden-campaign-senior-voters", "text": "Gussie Farris, 86, spends no time worrying about the ages of the oldest presidential candidates in American history. For those who do, this loyal supporter of President Joe Biden has sharp words about Donald Trump. \u201cBecause Trump is big and loud, he doesn\u2019t come off as old as maybe Biden does, but he\u2019s way less capable in the brain area,\u201d Farris said with a laugh, breaking a self-made rule about saying the former president\u2019s name aloud. Farris exemplifies a trend Biden\u2019s campaign is seeking to build on: strong performance among seniors \u2014 a group that polls show spends more time watching local and national news, thinks more about the 2024 election, and was alive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy. National and swing-state polls have shown Biden facing steep challenges winning over younger and non-White voters \u2014 constituencies that make up a key part of the Democratic coalition. But he\u2019s made gains among older voters, a group typically won handily by Republicans. It\u2019s a prized slice of the electorate, with high turnout rates and outsized sway in several key battleground states. Biden\u2019s campaign this week launched a new effort to court seniors \u2014 one it said will combine traditional organizing tactics like phone-banking and postcards with events like bingo nights and pickleball. His campaign touted endorsements from several groups focused on protecting Social Security, Medicare and pensions, and dispatched surrogates across the country to speak with senior groups. First lady Jill Biden, who traveled to Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Thursday as part of the initiative\u2019s launch, pushed back on criticism of her husband\u2019s age, which Trump and Republicans have sought to make a focal point of the 2024 race. \u201cJoe and that other guy are essentially the same age, let\u2019s not be fooled,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what this election is about, it\u2019s about the character of the person leading our country.\u201d Biden insisted that her husband is \u201ca healthy, wise 81-year-old, ready and willing to work for you every day to make our future better.\u201d \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d she said. As Trump turns 78 on Friday \u2014 just three years younger than Biden\u2019s 81 \u2014 age is an unmistakable part of the bitterly contested race for the White House. But the Biden campaign is suddenly embracing age in a different way by turning to seniors like Farris to build a critical piece of his coalition. \u201cI have people that come up to me because they know I\u2019m a Democrat and say, \u2018What can I do? I have to do something, find me something to do.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that happen before,\u201d said Farris, a retired school counselor. \u201cThey don\u2019t want Trump. They don\u2019t want him to be the president. And I think they\u2019re scared. They\u2019re worried about our democracy and what he would do.\u201d Grand Rapids and surrounding Kent County\u00a0serve as\u00a0a bellwether within the broader battleground of Michigan. Biden won here by 6 points in 2020, contributing to his statewide victory, after Trump narrowly carried\u00a0both\u00a0the\u00a0county and state four years earlier \u201cWe could determine who sits in the White House. It\u2019s a swing state. We have to retain that it\u2019s blue,\u201d said Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who became politically awakened and engaged after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen.\u201d Biden is working to become the first Democratic presidential candidate in nearly a quarter century to win voters 65 and older. Since Al Gore narrowly carried the senior vote in 2000, Republican candidates have consistently won the senior vote. In 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country. \u201cI think baby boomers are doing the heavy lifting of the work right now,\u201d said Kim Gates, chairwoman of the Kent County Democratic Party, who also became active in politics after the 2016 election. \u201cThey\u2019re at a point in their life where they\u2019ve seen how politics has changed and recognize that it\u2019s a priority for them.\u201d As other parts of the Biden coalition are fraying, the campaign is putting a renewed focus on seniors to volunteer and vote. Yet a sense of deep disappointment weighs heavy on Grand Rapids retiree Barbara Howard, 70, who voted for Biden four years ago but won\u2019t this time. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not going to vote for president,\u201d said Howard, a supporter of Palestinian rights who calls Biden\u2019s backing of Israel a betrayal. \u201cI just feel like I need to make a statement that this is unacceptable. Where are we are at in this country? It doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s Biden or Trump.\u201d Judy and Nick Herrick, both 80 and retired, say the president\u2019s steady hand and commitment to protecting democracy inspires them to volunteer for Biden\u2019s reelection. They often canvass and register younger voters in Grand Rapids. \u201cWhat do they say, 80 is the new 60?\u201d Judy Herrick said with a laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting for me is the opportunity for seniors to talk with young folks \u2026 if you\u2019re in your 20s, or the 30s, what impact is having a president like Trump with you?\u201d Nick Herrick is quick to defend the president\u2019s age to anyone who asks. \u201cHe\u2019s one year older than me. And when we get done here \u2026 I\u2019m going to go home and water ski,\u201d Herrick said. \u201cAge is sort of a thing in the mind, and I look at his thinking and his approach to things looks pretty good to me, especially when you view it in contrast to what the alternative is.\u201d That contrast with Trump is what the Biden campaign is investing millions on television ads targeting some favorite programs of seniors, including \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and the local news. \u201cThe senior generation, values and character are important to us,\u201d Farris said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they could vote someone like, like Trump with no sense of morals or character or ethics, or, you know, the kind of tradition that most seniors have.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/biden-campaign-senior-voters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_garret-graves-louisiana-reelection", "text": "Republican Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana announced Friday that he will not seek reelection, ending months of uncertainty after a new congressional map made his seat significantly Democratic. \u201cRepresenting South Louisiana and serving in the United States Congress has been an incredible honor,\u201d Graves said in a statement, before adding that \u201crunning for Congress this year does not make sense.\u201d Amid a long and winding legal battle over the congressional lines in Louisiana, the US Supreme Court last month allowed the state to use the new map\u00a0in this year\u2019s elections. A federal judge had previously thrown out the existing map, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. While Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its six-member US House delegation. Under the new lines crafted by the GOP-controlled state Legislature, Grave\u2019s 6th Congressional District was redrawn into Louisiana\u2019s second Black-majority district \u2013 one that Joe Biden would have carried by 20 points in 2020. Graves\u2019 announcement will come as a blow to House Republicans, who are looking to defend their razor-thin majority in the chamber. There had been speculation that Graves could try to challenge a fellow Republican incumbent in a neighboring district. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Louisianan, endorsed all Republican incumbents in the state\u2019s delegation last month, including Graves for reelection to his current 6th District seat. The congressman conceded Friday that running for a different seat this year was not an option. \u201cIt is evident that a run in any temporary district will cause actual permanent damage to Louisiana\u2019s great representation in Congress,\u201d he said in remarks that hinted at potential further legal challenges to the new map. In recent months, Graves has faced opposition from within his own party, at home and in Washington. The new map, which made Graves\u2019 seat more Democratic, was backed by Louisiana\u2019s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Graves backed Landry\u2019s opponent in the state\u2019s gubernatorial primary last year. Graves was also among the closest allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from his leadership post in October. In the lead-up to the historic vote, Graves slammed hard-line members of the House GOP conference who were dangling the threat of ousting McCarthy amid efforts to pass stopgap funding legislation. McCarthy reacted to Graves\u2019 announcement in a social media post Friday evening, describing the Louisiana Republican as \u201ca loyal friend\u201d and \u201cthe best of what public service can and should be.\u201d \u201cNo matter the issue, Garret was the first to jump in with enthusiasm, intellect, and a legendary sense of humor,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that Graves\u2019 \u201cabsence will be a major loss for the conference and the entire House.\u201d Graves was first elected to Congress in 2014, succeeding fellow Republican Bill Cassidy, who vacated the seat for a successful US Senate run. Under the current lines, the 6th District, which includes parts of the Baton Rouge area, has been a Republican stronghold. But the redrawn district now leans decidedly Democratic, stretching from Shreveport in the state\u2019s northwest to Baton Rouge. Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress for two terms in the 1990s, is seen as the front-runner in the district\u2019s jungle primary in November.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_g7-loan-ukraine-russian-investments", "text": "Group of Seven leaders have reached an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, a senior administration official confirmed Thursday. The United States and its G7 contemporaries have placed a high value on showing their support for Ukraine during this year\u2019s summit, which is taking place in Italy. While Ukraine is not a G7 member, its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, attended the summit and participated in a Thursday evening joint news conference with Biden. \u201cWould we stand with Ukraine?\u201d Biden said at the news conference. \u201cWould we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny? The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered that question by saying yes we will. We will say it again \u2026 we\u2019re going to stand with Ukraine.\u201d The leaders will soon issue a joint communiqu\u00e9, the product of \u201cyears\u201d of negotiation complicated by a patchwork of jurisdictional laws that required the direct involvement of Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, among other top US officials. \u201cWhen you have a commitment at the highest political levels, technocrats act and technical details get worked out,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,\u201d the senior official said. The official added that it\u2019s \u201conly fair that we close the gap by making Russia pay, not our taxpayers, and we found a way to do so that respects the rule of law in every jurisdiction.\u201d During the news conference, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine after both leaders signed an agreement vowing lasting US support for Ukraine\u2019s defense now and in the future. But Biden might be making a commitment that he cannot fulfill if his political rival, former President Donald Trump, again wins the White House in November. Further US support for Ukraine could be jeopardized under a new Trump administration. The former president has long spoken admirably of strongmen, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and shocked world leaders by saying earlier this year that he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to US partner countries who don\u2019t fulfill certain defense spending obligations. For his part, Zelensky appeared outwardly optimistic that his country would retain US support no matter who is the president. \u201cThey work based on the voice of their people and it is impossible without people,\u201d Zelensky, who was speaking Ukrainian, said of US leaders. \u201cI am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents \u2026 and it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity\u00a0within this or that state \u2014 and\u00a0if the people are with us, any\u00a0leader will be with us in this\u00a0struggle for freedom,\u201d he added, according to a realtime translator. The loan will be drawn from funds frozen by Western leaders in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While just $3 billion in frozen funds is located in US banks, a much larger share, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars, is located in banks in Europe. Negotiators have focused on a loan amount of about $50 billion. It will take some time before Ukraine begins to receive this money, but the official said the effort would \u201cmove with urgency\u201d and the commitment remains \u201cto be ready to disburse $50 billion this calendar year.\u201d If the loan is disbursed by the end of 2024, it would ensure the money got to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine. In the United States, which has remained a crucial ally to Ukraine, promises of funding for defense systems and military weaponry are known to be difficult to fulfill. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress held up critically needed military funding for the war-torn country after Trump came out against a deal. That holdup carried with it real-world consequences to Ukraine\u2019s defense capabilities. Though the Senate would eventually pass a $95 billion aid package that included funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Ukrainian officials have said that aid came too late for troops on the ground. The agreement reached in Italy on Thursday would free up chests of funds in Europe that would not be hampered by further political bickering in the United States. \u201cThe next steps are to enshrine the communiqu\u00e9 commitments with the EU 27, the full membership, then we need to write contracts between the lenders \u2026 the recipient, which is Ukraine, and the intermediaries,\u201d the official said. From there, there will be an agreement on a disbursal schedule. Should a peace agreement be reached and the war end, there is also a plan in place: \u201cG7 leaders have committed that the assets will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damages that\u2019s caused. So if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized and keep generating interest to repay the loans, or Russia pays for the damage it\u2019s caused. Either way, there\u2019s a source of repayment.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/g7-loan-ukraine-russian-investments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_donald-trump-birthday", "text": "In a rare speechless moment Sunday, Donald Trump stepped back from the microphone as his Las Vegas supporters spontaneously broke into a disjointed rendition of the world\u2019s most recognizable song. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain point at which you don\u2019t want to hear \u2018Happy Birthday,\u2019\u201d the former president said when they finished. \u201cYou just want to pretend the day doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d The day does exist, and it\u2019s today. Trump is now 78 years old. It\u2019s an age that has clearly occupied space in Trump\u2019s mind for some time. \u201cJust remember what I\u2019m telling you: 78 is not old,\u201d Trump asserted to a New York Post gossip columnist almost two years ago. The offhand remark came during a conversation about his first wife, Ivana, upon the occasion of her passing at age 73. The significance of 78 is unmistakable. It\u2019s the same age his opponent, President Joe Biden, turned shortly after winning the election in 2020. Concerns about Biden\u2019s fitness for office have followed him ever since, accentuated by a physical decline and diminished appearance that Trump\u2019s allies and his campaign have gleefully amplified. Yet, if Trump wins, he would be the oldest president at his swearing in at 78 years and 219 days, surpassing Biden\u2019s previous record of 78 years and 61 days. (Biden, of course, would break his own record on inauguration day if reelected.) And amid his third White House bid \u2013 for which he has maintained a notably light travel schedule and has appeared tired at times during court appearances \u2013 Trump\u2019s own mental acuity has faced intense scrutiny from political foes,\u00a0including\u00a0Biden. \u201cBut let\u2019s all remember Donald Trump is just a flatulent old man with an orange spray-tan who fell asleep at his own trial,\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at the Wisconsin Democratic convention last weekend. There\u2019s this too: For the remainder of the presidential race, just three years will separate the ages of Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, on paper \u2014 a reminder that the two men are indeed of the same era. Born to parents of the Greatest Generation, they each grew up in the aftermath of World War II in a country forever changed by the threat of nuclear war, the proliferation of television and America\u2019s post-war boom. They would\u2019ve overlapped in high school, at least for a time. Through a combination of medial and student deferments, they both\u00a0avoided serving in the Vietnam War. They\u2019re both grandparents. In the rematch between the two oldest presidents to ever serve, the advanced age of the presumptive presidential nominees has been a much-discussed factor. More than half of US adults say both are too old to serve another term, according to an April ABC/Ipsos survey, 10 points higher than a year ago. The same surveys persistently show there are more reservations about the abilities of Biden than Trump \u2014 chiefly because Democrats are far more likely to express concerns about the incumbent\u2019s age and fitness than Republicans are willing to say about their own nominee. Trump, though, does not sound like a man convinced voters see much of a difference. Rather, in his public appearances, the former president\u00a0has labored to project his age as just a number and not a starting point for comparing him to Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t feel 77,\u201d he asserted during a freewheeling soliloquy at Trump Tower the morning after a Manhattan jury convicted him on 34 felony counts. Earlier this year, Trump similarly told an interviewer, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m about 35 years old. I actually feel better now than I did 30 years ago. Tell me, is that crazy?\u201d At his rallies, Trump regularly mocks Biden\u2019s cognitive abilities, and his campaign and allies have made a sport of sharing selectively edited clips of the president\u2019s appearances to unflattering effect. Trump, though, has experienced his own gaffes and verbal slips. Earlier this year, Trump confused former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He has misstated his location and once mistakenly compared his polling numbers to former President Barack Obama, not Biden. His Republican rivals seized on these missteps during the primary, hoping to convince GOP voters that the former president was a shell of the man who first stepped into the political arena nine years ago. Haley called Trump \u201ctotally unhinged\u201d and \u201cdiminished\u201d as she battled him for the nomination. The campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis highlighted Trump\u2019s perceived blunders by publishing a\u00a0\u201cTrump Accident Tracker\u201d while the candidate insisted Trump \u201clost the zip on his fastball.\u201d \u201cWhat Donald Trump does now is, he is wedded to the teleprompter,\u201d DeSantis said at one point. \u201cHe can\u2019t get off that teleprompter.\u201d Increasingly, Biden\u2019s campaign and its surrogates are stepping up attacks on Trump with criticisms similar to those once levied by the former president\u2019s Republican opponents. They notably took a more aggressive turn following Trump\u2019s Las Vegas rally, where his teleprompter malfunctioned causing the former president to ad lib some of his remarks. During one stretch, Trump delivered a 600-word riff about his concerns over battery-powered boats that included an extended stream-of-consciousness debate over whether it would be better to die by shark attack or electrocution. \u201cSo there\u2019s a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards, over here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking, water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking? Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted, or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted?\u201d Trump ultimately concluded: \u201cI\u2019ll take electrocution every single time. I\u2019m not getting near the shark.\u201d Biden\u2019s allies pounced on social media, sharing the diatribe widely. At a private fundraiser in New York this week, second gentleman Doug Emhoff told donors Trump these days lacked comprehension. \u201cThis is a degraded version of an already horrible person,\u201d Emhoff said in reference to Trump\u2019s Vegas speech. \u201cHe is degrading before our eyes.\u201d The chirping continued on the eve of Trump\u2019s birthday as the former president met with Congressional Republicans. In private meetings Thursday in Washington, Trump veered across topics, ranting about Taylor Swift potentially endorsing his opponent to claiming Pelosi\u2019s daughter said the former House Speaker could have dated Trump, which one daughter denied and called \u201cunhinged.\u201d He offered muddled political advice on how Republicans should discuss abortion, bragged about House members who lost seats after voting to impeach him and called the GOP convention host city of Milwaukee \u201chorrible,\u201d spurring conflicting accounts of what he meant from Wisconsin Republicans. Many in the meetings who talked to reporters afterward raved that Trump had presented as unified and strong. The Biden campaign called Trump \u201cfeeble\u201d on social media when the former president ended a post-meeting news conference after five minutes without taking questions. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement to CNN replied to recent attacks by saying that Biden \u201cand his floundering campaign have resorted to becoming parodies of themselves.\u201d \u201cAside from trying to explain away losing his declining memory, shuffling his feet like a short-circuited Roomba, and falling on his ass over and over again, they\u2019ll have to take responsibility for their out-of-control border, runaway inflation, and surging crime rates that have decimated every American,\u201d Cheung said. But the observations about Trump\u2019s age and mental state are not just coming from inside the Biden campaign. Alyssa Farah Griffin, who resigned as communications director in Trump\u2019s White House in December 2020, said on \u201cThe View\u201d there are \u201cglaring warning signs about Trump.\u201d \u201cListening to him now does not sound like him in 2016 and he was not ever particularly eloquent,\u201d Griffin, a co-host on the show and a CNN contributor. \u201cI\u2019m recognizing and seeing a decline in him. Others who\u2019ve known him have said it and I think that that matters.\u201d Notably, Trump\u2019s allies see his age as a potential factor that could keep him out of jail following his felony conviction. Asked about the likelihood of Trump ending up behind bars, Jonathan Turley, an attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School friendly to the former president, said it would be \u201cabsurd.\u201d One of the reasons? \u201cHe is an elderly first offender,\u201d Turley said. Amid the constant questions about Trump\u2019s longevity, though, he has told his supporters not to worry. He has good genes. \u201cMy father lived a long time. My mother lived a long time and they were happy and they were great,\u201d Trump told the Vegas crowd. \u201cSo maybe we\u2019re gonna live a long time.\u201d This headline has been updated.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_nato-agreement-ukraine-aid", "text": "NATO defense ministers are expected to finalize an agreement on Friday that will give\u00a0the alliance\u00a0greater control over security assistance and training for Ukraine\u2019s military, an attempt some officials say is meant to give Europe greater responsibility over the aid amid uncertainty\u00a0over the outcome of the US presidential election this fall. The possibility that former President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of providing US military support to NATO and Europe, could win the election \u201cis a huge part\u201d of why NATO is moving forward with the consolidation plan, said one official familiar with the discussions. It is also a way to give Europe more responsibility\u00a0over\u00a0the training and equipping of Ukraine as the extent of the\u00a0US\u2019 commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia\u00a0after the election remains unclear, the official said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the intent in a news conference on Thursday, saying NATO provides \u201cmore than 99% of all military support to Ukraine \u2026 so it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts.\u201d \u201cThis will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv, and address both immediate and long-term needs,\u201d Stoltenberg said. A US defense official and European diplomat added that the effort will be headquartered in Wiesbaden, Germany and fall under NATO command, led by a three-star general reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Chris Cavoli, who is also the head of US European Command. Earlier in the day on Thursday, Stoltenberg said the \u201cwhole idea\u201d of the new framework was to \u201cminimize the risk for gaps and delays\u201d \u2014 particularly after a months-long delay by the US in providing additional security aid had real negative impacts on Ukraine\u2019s ability to fight Russia. \u201cThe whole idea is to minimize the risk for gaps and delays as we saw earlier this year, because the gaps in delays in both the provision of military support from the United States but also from several European allies, made a difference on the battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one of the reasons why the Russians are now able to push and to actually occupy more land in Ukraine.\u201d Stoltenberg also said Thursday that he has proposed NATO allies provide Ukraine a minimum of 40 billion euros a year \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d \u2014 a number that he said allies have already approximately provided annually since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022. Ukraine needs the annual funds \u201cto ensure they have the resources to repel Russian aggression against their country,\u201d he said. CNN previously reported the options around ensuring long-term support for Ukraine, which one senior European diplomat described at the time as \u201cfuture-proofing.\u201d A senior US Defense Department official told reporters on Thursday it was important to ensure that the capabilities and troops assisting Ukraine is being done with \u201can eye \u2026 towards NATO interoperability and integration.\u201d \u201cRight now it\u2019s pretty ad hoc,\u201d the official said. \u201cA nation raises its hand and says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the artillery coalition,\u2019 another says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the drone coalition\u2019 \u2014 who\u2019s actually sitting down and mapping these things out and making sure that that force that\u2019s being built is going to make sense to deter and defend against what Ukraine needs to deter and defend against? Who\u2019s thinking through the extent to which that force is interoperable with Polish forces, for example. Earlier this week, the plan to centralize the alliance\u2019s military support for Ukraine overcame a major hurdle when Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said that while Hungary will not participate in the scheme, it will not veto it. \u201cThe prime minister has assured me that Hungary will not oppose these efforts, enabling other allies to move forward, and he has confirmed that Hungary will continue to meet its NATO commitments in full,\u201d Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group and NATO defense ministers\u2019 meetings are happening in Brussels as a Group of Seven nations summit in Italy is taking place, where support for Ukraine remains a top issue. Leaders of G7 nations have agreed to loan Ukraine money backed by profits from frozen Russian investments. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that the loan amount totals roughly $50 billion, which is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024 \u2014 before a potential change in US administrations. The US and Ukraine are also\u00a0expected to sign\u00a0a long-term security agreement at the G7 summit, after months of negotiations, but could ultimately be undone by a new administration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/nato-agreement-ukraine-aid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_us-temporarily-dismantle-gaza-pier", "text": "The US military will temporarily dismantle the\u00a0humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza\u00a0and move it back to Israel on Friday night, amid concerns that heavy seas could once again break\u00a0it just days after it resumed aid delivery operations, multiple\u00a0US\u00a0officials and US Central Command said. It will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the\u00a0Shore,\u00a0or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of Ashdod.\u00a0It is a pre-emptive safety measure, a US official said,\u00a0and aid operations across the pier will be suspended until sea conditions allow for it to be moved back into place. Humanitarian aid deliveries across the pier continued for a full day on Friday, the official said, and it is expected to be detached and towed to Ashdod late Friday night local time. \u201cThe decision to temporarily relocate the pier is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement. \u201cAfter the period of expected high seas, the pier will be rapidly re-anchored to the coast of Gaza and resume delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. Since May 17, over 3,500 metric tons (7.7 million pounds) have been delivered through the maritime corridor for onward delivery by humanitarian organizations,\u201d CENTCOM continued. To date, the pier has been\u00a0used to move\u00a0thousands of tons of aid into Gaza, officials have said, but\u00a0it has been plagued with logistical issues since becoming operational in May. Last month,\u00a0rough seas caused four US Army vessels supporting the pier to break free from their moorings and wash ashore on Israeli beaches.\u00a0Also last month,\u00a0the pier broke\u00a0apart and sustained damage in heavy seas and had to be towed to Ashdod for repairs that took over a week. It was moved back to Gaza last week and resumed operations on Saturday but had to pause again due to heavy seas on Sunday and Monday. Officials have told CNN that\u00a0sea conditions in the eastern Mediterranean will only worsen as fall and winter approach, raising questions about the pier\u2019s realistic lifespan. Meanwhile,\u00a0the World Food Programme\u2019s aid distribution operations at the pier have been suspended for\u00a0days,\u00a0and aid has been piling up in the staging area on the beach in Gaza, officials said this week. The operations will remain paused pending a\u00a0WFP\u00a0risk assessment, which is ongoing after the Israel Defense Forces conducted operations near the pier\u00a0Saturday as part of a hostage rescue operation. The presence of at least one Israeli helicopter so close to the pier led the US military to forcefully push back on any claims that it was used as part of the Israeli operation, reiterating that it is a humanitarian mission only. Once the WFP assessment is completed, it will\u00a0fall on\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations\u2019\u00a0Department of Safety and Security and the humanitarian coordinator to make a decision on whether to resume operations at the pier. Humanitarian officials say\u00a0that\u00a0while\u00a0getting\u00a0any assistance\u00a0into the Gaza\u00a0Strip\u00a0is useful, the pier is not a long-term sustainable solution. The Israeli government for months refused to open additional land crossings for aid into Gaza, and only did so after immense pressure by the US government in recent months. Even with additional openings, major obstacles to distribution within the Gaza\u00a0Strip\u00a0remain,and humanitarian officials tell CNN that there is still not an effective deconfliction method to protect aid workers. CNN reported on Thursday that the US military\u00a0was considering dismantling the pier.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_donald-trump-return-inspires-g7", "text": "President Joe Biden and fellow G7 leaders meeting on the coast of Italy this week are working to harden support for Ukraine and rush western resources to the country as they look uneasily toward November\u2019s US election, which could portend a shift in American stance. The plans to hasten tens of billions of dollars to the besieged nation and ink a security agreement between Washington and Kyiv that helps Ukraine achieve self-sufficiency were intended to demonstrate resolve \u2013 and a degree of political creativity \u2013 amid Russian battlefield momentum. \u201cCollectively, this is a powerful set of actions, and it will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine\u2019s success,\u201d Biden said during a news conference Thursday alongside his counterpart from Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky, who wore his usual army green uniform. Calling Russia\u2019s invasion a \u201ctest for the world,\u201d the US leader said he and his allies at the G7 had consistently answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether they would stand by Ukraine. \u201cWe will say it again,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, again and again and again.\u201d Yet whether the measures agreed to this week can withstand another Donald Trump presidency remained something of an unknown. As Biden was finalizing his agreements in Italy, Trump was meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill, where he\u00a0once again made clear he didn\u2019t want to see another $60 billion in aid flowing to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with his comments.\u00a0Trump argued, as he had before, that if he were president the war wouldn\u2019t still be going. Opposed to additional Ukraine aid and openly skeptical of NATO, Trump could rip up the bilateral agreement Biden signed Thursday if he returned to office. \u201cIf Trump is inaugurated at noon on the 20 of January next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,\u201d said John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump. \u201cSo, if you can\u2019t bind a future president who doesn\u2019t want to be bound, and that includes getting out of treaties, which this isn\u2019t even a treaty, I think there may actually be a bit of a downside here when Trump hears about this and concludes they\u2019re trying to lock him in, that will just make him more irritated.\u201d Such a move would be in keeping with Trump\u2019s decisions during his previous term to abandon foreign policy agreements negotiated by his Democratic predecessor, including the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Few European diplomats hold out hope for a change in tactic a second time around. The\u00a0memories\u00a0from\u00a0those years are still fresh for some G7 leaders and have helped drive the urgency in finding ways to funnel support to Ukraine at this year\u2019s summit, before Trump\u2019s prospective return. Speaking at the news conference with Biden, Zelensky said it was up to the American people to demonstrate to their leader \u2013 whoever he is \u2013 that standing with Ukraine is a priority. \u201cIt\u00a0seems to me that no matter whom\u00a0the nation chooses, first and\u00a0foremost, it seems to me that\u00a0everything depends on the unity\u00a0within this or that state,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cAnd\u00a0if the people are with us, any\u00a0leader will be with us in this\u00a0struggle for freedom.\u201d Upcoming US election sparks urgency The forthcoming election helped create an impetus to finalize a long-debated plan to give Ukraine a $50 billion loan using interest earned on frozen Russian assets. American and European diplomats had been working through the technicalities of such a proposal for months. European officials were initially reluctant, raising concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal. Yet with uncertainty swirling around any American support in the future, the time to act appeared short. That the differences were resolved\u00a0during\u00a0a heated US election, in which one of the candidates openly opposes providing Ukraine any more aid, was not lost on many of the negotiators. \u201cThere was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that\u00a0this summit is our best chance to act collectively\u00a0to close the gap,\u201d a senior US administration official said. \u201cThis agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world that we\u2019re not going to fatigue on defending Ukraine\u2019s freedom, and that Putin is not going to outlast us.\u201d Officials said Ukraine would receive the first payments from the scheme sometime this year but would need additional time to use up all of the money being sent. \u201cIt is a very strong message to make sure that it is not us paying for the Russian damage, but it is Russia who has to pay,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Security deal faces uncertain future in a Trump presidency The deal, in the end, was about more than just money. It was proof, in Biden\u2019s mind, that likeminded allies can overcome differences for the greater good \u2014 in this case, helping a besieged democratic nation rebuild its infrastructure after an invasion by Russia. So, too, was his decision to sign a bilateral security accord with Zelensky intended to demonstrate long-term American commitment \u2013 even though the agreement has no guarantee of surviving if Trump wins. The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and\u00a0Ukraine and commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the pact a \u201creal marker\u201d of the American commitment to Ukraine \u201cnot just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\u201d And Biden, speaking in Italy, said the pact was designed to make Ukraine more self-sufficient \u2014 and, by extension, less dependent on shifting American sentiments. \u201cOur goal is to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cA lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine\u2019s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.\u201d Still, the pledge is an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201d making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. And it does not contain any new money and is instead \u201csubject to the availability of appropriated funds,\u201d according to its text. After a drawn-out battle this year with congressional Republicans to pass $60 billion for Ukraine \u2014 causing Biden to apologize last week for delays that US officials say helped Russia regain momentum on the battlefield \u2014 there is little likelihood the president will go back to Congress this year for additional funding. Biden pushes G7 to back reproductive rights Even on an issue unrelated to Ukraine, Biden sought this week to consolidate G7 support in a way that would be unlikely if Trump were to return to the summit. Behind the scenes, he and US officials pushed to keep language about reproductive rights in a G7 leaders\u2019 statement after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document, according to American officials. The back-and-forth illustrated some of the fraught dynamics at play at the summit. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid, and a key point of contrast with Trump. \u201cThe president\u00a0felt very strongly\u00a0that we needed to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women\u2019s health and reproductive rights,\u201d a senior US administration official said, referring to last year\u2019s G7 summit in Japan. In that document, leaders reiterated their support for \u201caccess to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.\u201d It also expressed \u201cstrong concern about the rollback of women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights.\u201d The trip to the rocky Adriatic coast this week is likely to be Biden\u2019s final time abroad before November\u2019s elections, and a final moment to harden alliances in person and seal agreements before the unknowable outcome of the\u00a0vote. American allies in Europe are collectively preparing for a second Trump administration with a sense both of trepidation and exhaustion. During diplomatic visits and quiet pull-asides at summits like the G7, it is a topic of constant conversation. French luminaries who were invited to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace last week for a state dinner in honor of Biden openly discussed their anxiety about Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House, according to a person who attended. Those who lived through the experience the first time around have little appetite for a return to the open animosity and norm-busting rituals that came with Trump wherever he went, be it battles over climate on a cliffside in Sicily, haggling on trade in the forests of Quebec or an argument over readmitting Russia at a lighthouse in\u00a0Biarritz. By the end of his term, Trump had begun questioning the utility of attending the gatherings at all, fed up with what he saw as an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/donald-trump-return-inspires-g7/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Earlier\u00a0this year,\u00a0the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel published a report that found\u00a0Israeli civilians suffered \u201cbrutal sexual assaults\u201d that were carried out \u201csystematically and deliberately\u201d during\u00a0Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. The report, which includes testimonies from eyewitnesses, first responders, forensic experts and news articles, says Hamas militants who entered Israel used extreme acts of sexual violence against their victims and, in most cases, killed them \u201cafter or even during the rape.\u201d According to evidence collected by the ARCCI \u2013 an umbrella organization for nine regional Rape Crisis Centers \u2013 men, women, and children were all victims of gruesome sexual abuse on October 7. The report outlines witness testimony of the brutality of the sexual crimes, including that of gang rape at the Nova music festival, in the desert of southern Israel. Two former hostages who were released in late November described witnessing and hearing about other hostages being assaulted while in captivity, according to their testimony, which the report emphasizes is likely continuing to happen to the hostages that remain in Gaza.

Johnson said in a statement that he disagrees with the DOJ\u2019s decision, calling it \u201canother example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration.\u201d \u201cI will be certifying the contempt reports to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe will also move to enforce the subpoena of Attorney General Garland in federal court.\u201d In a letter to Johnson earlier Friday, DOJ pointed to its \u201clongstanding\u201d position of not prosecuting executive branch officials who withhold information subject to executive privilege from Congress. The announcement was anticipated after the House, in a mostly party-line vote, held Garland in contempt for not turning over audio from Biden\u2019s interview in special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s classified documents investigation. \u201cConsistent\u00a0with this\u00a0longstanding\u00a0position and uniform practice,\u00a0the\u00a0Department has determined\u00a0that\u00a0the responses by Attorney General Garland to\u00a0the subpoenas\u00a0issued\u00a0by\u00a0the Committees\u00a0did not\u00a0constitute\u00a0a\u00a0crime,\u00a0and\u00a0accordingly the\u00a0Department will not bring\u00a0the congressional\u00a0contempt\u00a0citation before\u00a0a\u00a0grand\u00a0jury or take\u00a0any other action to\u00a0prosecute the Attorney General,\u201d the letter, from the department\u2019s top congressional liaison, said. Republican lawmakers have argued that access to the tapes would provide more information, transparency and oversight around the investigation into a sitting US president. On Wednesday, every Republican in the House except one \u2013 Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio \u2013 voted to hold Garland in contempt of Congress. While the Justice Department has defended its decision to not turn over the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews with Hur and his team \u2013 claiming the decision was made in part to protect this and future investigations \u2013 the Justice Department did make public transcripts of those interviews. In describing the interviews, Hur said that Biden presented himself \u201cas a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d At the time, Biden ridiculed Hur\u2019s report and questions about his memory. \u201cTheir task was to make a decision over whether to move forward with charges in this case,\u201d Biden said during a press conference following the report, noting that Hur did not move forward with charges. \u201cFor any extraneous commentary they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. It has not place in this report.\u201d CNN has\u00a0sued for access to the audio recordings, writing in the April lawsuit that \u201cwithout access to any of the interview records, the press and public initially could not form their own conclusions about Hur\u2019s characterization of Biden. \u2026 Transcripts, however, are no substitute for recordings.\u201d In a statement following the vote to hold him in contempt, Garland said Republicans had turned \u201ca serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon\u201d and that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump got his 78th birthday present a day early \u2014 a handshake from his longtime bitter critic, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0encapsulating the Republican Party\u2019s complete submission to its presumptive presidential nominee. The twice-impeached 45th president and newly convicted criminal was back on Capitol Hill Thursday for the first time since his supporters beat up police officers and smashed their way through the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. A rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d from House Republicans contrasted with the cries from more than three years ago to \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d from Trump\u2019s mob as they acted on his plea to \u201cfight like hell\u201d after weeks of promoting false claims about election fraud. Keen to please their champion and create an optimistic omen for November, House members paid tribute to the ex-president with a bat and game ball they won after trouncing Democrats in the annual congressional baseball game Wednesday. There was a distinct impression of subordinates paying homage to a strongman leader. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 primary opponent now seen as a potential GOP vice presidential nominee, called it \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d after GOP senators feted Trump a mere two weeks after he became the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. Another 2016 foe of the ex-president, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who endured insults Trump flung at his father and his wife, stood to applaud his vanquisher. But the most striking image from the day was a handshake between McConnell and the ex-president captured in a photo by Doug Mills of The New York Times that sums up an era. The veteran Kentucky senator has never hidden his disdain for Trump, though he has always sought to preserve his own power and didn\u2019t take steps to convict him in Senate trials after his two impeachments. The dislike has been mutual, with the former president blasting McConnell as \u201cthe old crow\u201d at rallies and making racist comments about McConnell\u2019s wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. In January 2021, McConnell said, \u201cThe mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.\u201d He said Trump was morally and practically responsible for the assault on his beloved Capitol. On Thursday, after meeting Trump for the first time since that day of infamy, he lauded their \u201centirely positive\u201d encounter, during which the former president clasped McConnell\u2019s hand in both of his. It would strain credulity that McConnell has shed his private contempt for the ex-president. But he told reporters who asked him about their meeting: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you that was negative.\u201d The exchange between McConnell and Trump was an apt emblem for a day that Trump choreographed to show a coming together in his party \u2013 despite the thousands of votes cast in GOP primaries for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for months after she suspended her campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\u201d the ex-president said. \u201cWe want to see borders. We want to see strong military. We want to see money not wasted all over the world.\u201d How Trump asserts power Trump\u2019s assertion of omnipotence over his party was an example of the power projection he adores, which often requires the subordination of supplicants. And it also showed what Republicans who want their own power are prepared to do to keep it. The pageant of adulation on Capitol Hill was also yet another reminder that there will be no price for Trump to pay in his party for an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power. And it was likely a preview of the deference to Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts and zeal for vengeance that America can expect from Republicans in Washington should he win back the White House \u2013 even from those in a branch of government that is supposed to constrain presidents. Another of Trump\u2019s possible vice-presidential picks, Ohio Sen J.D. Vance, was asked how some senior Republicans who had condemned Trump after January 6 could meet and applaud him now. \u201cNo real Republican with any credibility in the party is still blaming him,\u201d Vance, who had not yet been elected at the time, said, adding that some of Trump\u2019s critics in the room were supportive. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing and the Republican Party is in a good place.\u201d Vance is not wrong. Almost every major Republican who stood up to Trump in 2021 is gone or on the way out of the door. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is retiring. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was driven out of House leadership and then Congress for telling the truth about his election lies. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan harshly criticized Trump this week for breaking his oath of office to uphold the Constitution. But his comments on Fox News came amid a comfortable retirement, all his ambition long gone. Lawmakers who stood alongside Trump on Thursday did not necessarily do it because they like him. His huge popularity in the grassroots GOP means that they know that they can say goodbye to their political futures if they choose not to. This is even the case when Trump\u2019s deportment insults the normal codes of behavior expected of a presidential nominee. Biden speaks of democracy abroad while Trump undermines it at home Trump\u2019s return to Washington came the day before he turned 78, the age at which President Joe Biden \u2014 whom his predecessor says is too old to serve \u2014 took office after beating him in the 2020 election. Their 2024 rematch is neck-and-neck, according to polls, with each seeking to make the contest a referendum on the other\u2019s single term. Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to try to exploit Trump\u2019s return visit to a city he left scarred and traumatized by the Capitol riot, releasing a new campaign video that showed scenes of the assault. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more sacred than our democracy, but Donald Trump\u2019s ready to burn it all down,\u201d a narrator said in the ad, which is airing in battleground states. Biden, 81, was thousands of miles away from Washington when Trump showed up, participating in the G7 summit in Italy. It\u2019s the second foreign trip in two weeks he is using an as allegory for a US presidential season he is trying to cast as a fight to save American democracy. Unveiling a series of new plans to boost Ukraine diplomatically, militarily and economically, the president recalled that the US and its allies had been repeatedly asked whether they\u2019d stand firm for a country that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to wipe off the map. \u201cWe will say it again, yes, again and again and again we\u2019re going to stand with Ukraine,\u201d Biden said, as he stood with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A flurry of initiatives to institutionalize Western support for Ukraine being unveiled at the summit are a clear effort to hedge against the possibility that Trump could return to power on January 20, 2025. The ex-president frequently cozied up to Putin while in office and has said he\u2019d end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours \u2014 a feat that could only be achieved by locking in Russia\u2019s territorial gains after its brutal invasion Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton warned on Thursday that Biden could not guarantee that the 10-year pact that covers military training, intelligence cooperation and other areas that he signed with Zelensky on Thursday would last. \u201cI think it is illusory, though, for anyone to think Trump would be bound by it. If Trump is inaugurated at noon on January 20 next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,\u201d Bolton told Bianna Golodryga on CNN International. If Trump gets elected and does walk away from Ukraine, he will complete the transformation of a Republican Party that once prided itself in standing up for democracy worldwide and that, under President Ronald Reagan, won the Cold War. \u201cYou can\u2019t bind a future president who doesn\u2019t want to be bound,\u201d Bolton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin", "text": "President Joe Biden is leading the world\u2019s richest democracies in sending a beefed-up message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West will not forsake Ukraine despite political shocks casting doubts over its commitment. Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago. \u201cWe will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,\u201d Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. \u201cUkraine\u2019s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. \u2026\u00a0The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president\u2019s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe\u2019s security. And the \u201cautocrats of the world\u201d name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House. Biden\u2019s emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy. But uncertainty over the West\u2019s long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It\u2019s fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky. In the United States, Trump \u2013 who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe\u2019s security given his endless attacks on NATO \u2013 may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend \u2013 especially in powerhouses France and Germany \u2013 could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin\u2019s willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does. But a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine\u2019s Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America\u2019s fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November. A flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine Still, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent. \u2014Biden\u2019s return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House\u2019s priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries. \u2014As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin\u2019s war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. \u201cRussia today has become a war economy,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. \u201cEvery day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.\u201d \u2014Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine\u2019s armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we\u2019ll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power. \u2014US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit \u2013 which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada \u2013 will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets. \u2014These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky\u2019s elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance. Russian advances on the battlefield These are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured. The latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites \u201ca worrisome trend\u201d of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Relentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv\u2019s electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon. Russian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe\u2019s territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war. \u201cThe Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,\u201d Clark said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Technically, they\u2019re pretty smart. They\u2019ve got China behind them; they\u2019ve got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later. An inspiring war turns into a bitter slog An extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes. At times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky\u2019s interactions with the West. The Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package \u2013 a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up. Biden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan. Not surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden\u2019s core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president\u2019s critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to \u201ctake bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom.\u201d But there\u2019s a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_social-security-medicare-election-what-matters", "text": "Unlike most Republicans who have been critical of former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Paul Ryan is not about to make an endorsement or even indicate he\u2019ll grudgingly vote for Trump. Arguing Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d for office, Ryan, a Republican who represented the battleground state of Wisconsin in Congress, said on Fox News this week that he\u2019ll write in some other Republican \u2013 a conservative rather than a populist like Trump. It was a notable moment, particularly since it occurred on Fox News, where opposition to Trump is hard to come by. Ryan, who has turned to a lucrative career on Wall Street since leaving politics, remains on the board of the conservative network\u2019s parent company. \u201cI would prefer a party that is based on principles, not personality or populism,\u201d Ryan said, describing himself as \u201can anti-establishment Republican at this time.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning turn for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, to be so out of whack with his party. Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who selected Ryan as his running mate, is also now effectively a member of the shrinking Republican resistance to Trump. A promise to do nothing Like many Americans, Ryan said he isn\u2019t happy with either of the major-party candidates, but he has a very specific reason for concern. It\u2019s worth taking a closer look at his important point. \u201cThey\u2019re both promising not to tackle the debt,\u201d Ryan said, coming back to the issue that has animated his political career. \u201cAll the First World countries have the same issue we have: baby boomers retiring and unfunded entitlements coming due, and massive amount of debt,\u201d he said, referring to Social Security and Medicare, on which millions of aging Americans rely for their quality of life but which also eat up a growing portion of federal spending. For the record, both President Joe Biden and Trump have sworn they will not cut benefits. When Trump suggested in an interview in March that he might be open to Medicare and Social Security cuts, his campaign quickly made clear that no, he was talking about waste, not touching the programs themselves. He attacked other Republicans during the primary for being open to reforming these programs. $34 trillion and counting The current US national debt exceeds $34 trillion, a figure that has exploded under both parties. Pandemic-era spending had bipartisan support. Republicans passed massive tax cuts under Trump. Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act under Biden and the Affordable Care Act under then-President Barack Obama. Ryan is absolutely correct that neither side, at least at the presidential level, is making action on the debt a political priority. \u201cYou can fix it if you have the political will,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the political will right now. We don\u2019t have serious politics right now.\u201d Whether and exactly how concerned to be with that debt is a matter of intense debate among policy wonks and economists, but the idea that the US is on an unsustainable path is generally accepted. More focus on tax cuts Meanwhile, in the larger political conversation, there\u2019s more focus on how or whether to extend Trump-era tax cuts that will expire next year. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby has a look at the opposing promises from Biden and Trump. Trump wants to extend all of the tax cuts, which could further explode the debt without corresponding spending cuts. Biden, on the other hand, wants to allow the cuts to expire only for those making $400,000 and up. He would also try raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. When Trump and Republicans enacted the current tax structure, they made individual tax cuts temporary and most of the corporate tax cuts permanent. Democrats are also hoping to use the tax debate as leverage to increase social safety net spending. More from Luhby: Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced\u00a0child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous\u00a0Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the\u00a0American Rescue Plan Act\u00a0that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. Her story \u2013 read it here \u2013 outlines more of the looming tax implications and spells out the argument that the Trump tax cuts were a huge success alongside the opposing argument that they were a total failure. What\u2019s not up for debate is that the debt has grown, by trillions of dollars, under both Trump and Biden. Fearing \u2018radical budget surgery\u2019 Ryan fears a future when the Treasury Department can no longer sell the interest-bearing bonds that fund deficit spending, at which point the government would essentially have to print money to cover expenses. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a dollar crisis. That\u2019s when the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency is called into question. That\u2019s a huge privilege we could lose,\u201d he said, arguing it would lead to \u201cradical budget surgery\u201d \u2013 steep, painful cuts \u2013 to get out of the crisis. Solve the problem now or solve the problem later, he is arguing, but solving it now will be less painful. Tough choices could come sooner than you think Social Security won\u2019t be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035 unless Congress acts, according to a government forecast. Spending on the program will balloon, and the trust funds that currently fund it will run dry. At that point, the payroll tax and other income sources that fund Social Security will only be able to pay 83% of benefits. Congress will be forced to do something. It\u2019s a similar story with a slightly different timeline for Medicare. \u201cIf you step ahead of this problem, you can solve the insolvency of these entitlement programs without affecting anyone\u2019s benefits who are on them today,\u201d Ryan said. The broad strokes of what needs to be done are generally known and have been suggested by a variety of commissions, foundations and economic policy groups. The fixes could include incrementally raising the retirement age over the coming years and changing the funding structure for the systems to raise more money. Biden has proposed additional taxes on those making more than $400,000 to address Medicare\u2019s solvency, among other ideas, but does not have a detailed Social Security plan. Ryan has previously endorsed reform Ryan, to his credit, proposed some of the more revolutionary changes earlier in his career. When House Republicans passed versions of those plans, he paid a political price. They arguably contributed to his and Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. \u201cThe problem is, doing what I just said, you lay yourself out there for ridicule,\u201d Ryan said on Fox. \u201cYou lay yourself out there for political shots.\u201d He added: \u201cInvariably, the political demagoguery makes it look like you\u2019re taking something away from people. The dirty little secret in all of this is, Medicare and Social Security are going insolvent on their own. That means they go bankrupt. That means current seniors do get their benefits cut if we do nothing.\u201d But Ryan also deserves some blame He was House speaker, for instance, when Republicans passed those Trump tax cuts in 2017, which cut government income without addressing spending. Ryan suggested a fix to the problem now could be a commission set up to create a path to solvency and which would be able to force a vote in Congress. There are previous examples of such commissions, such as the one helmed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1983. Ryan actually sat on another one during the Obama administration. Chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, it was called the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and it sought a bipartisan menu of tough choices to deal with the unsustainable path it has been clear the US has been on for a long time. When it came time to endorse those proposals, however, Ryan voted no, helping kill the commission.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/social-security-medicare-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters", "text": "Theodore Roosevelt carefully crafted his image of rugged manliness. The wealthy heir became a Badlands cowboy and a volunteer Rough Rider and war hero. A populist and a reformer as president, Roosevelt enjoyed incredible popularity during his lifetime \u2013 and he nearly remade the American political system when, frustrated by the direction of the Republican Party after his presidency, he splintered off as a third-party candidate and nearly won election as a Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d in 1912. But that image is not complete, according to \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President,\u201d a new biography by Edward O\u2019Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, which is constructing a new Roosevelt library in the Badlands of North Dakota. O\u2019Keefe is also a former colleague at CNN. The book argues that the women in Roosevelt\u2019s life do not get the historical attention they deserve, something O\u2019Keefe proves with detailed research and engaging writing. I talked to O\u2019Keefe about the book and how Roosevelt and his definition of masculinity relate to today. Our conversation by phone, edited for length, is below: Notoriously masculine, but the product of unsung women WOLF: Your book is about the women behind the most notoriously masculine president. What were you trying to do here?  O\u2019KEEFE: \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d argues that the most masculine president in the American memory is actually the product of unsung and extraordinary women. Theodore Roosevelt is chiseled in marble on Mount Rushmore, and the myth is that everything he did in his incredibly successful personal and political life was the product of his own will. That is true, but it also isn\u2019t the full story. His two sisters, Bamie (Anna) and Conie (Corinne); his two wives, Alice and Edith; and his mother Mittie (Martha) were an integral part of his success, and their stories have been almost entirely lost to history. Frequently absent at times of emotional difficulty WOLF: That theme shines through \u2014 that these women propped up this most famous of American men. But much of his life is built around leaving them. He was not there when his first wife gave birth. He left his second wife, who was critically ill, to go off with the Rough Riders. He\u2019s on safari. He\u2019s in the Badlands. He\u2019s very absent. How do you reconcile that fact with the larger theme of the book? O\u2019KEEFE: I\u2019m so glad you noticed that. I had this fascinating conversation with Connie Roosevelt, who is the wife of Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy\u2019s great-grandson). The first time I met her in 2019, we were at a fundraiser for the National Parks Conservation Association, and I had just started to work on the research for what would become \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d And I said to Connie almost exactly as you\u2019re saying, that there is this pattern that Theodore Roosevelt is absent. He leaves in a lot of emotionally difficult circumstances. And she chuckled and said, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go hunting,\u201d which is a line that I do use in the book. Theodore Roosevelt, who is known for willing himself through physical pain \u2014 that resilience of a cowboy and a rancher would really wilt when it came to emotionally difficult circumstances. He basically abandoned his daughter for the better part of three years, offered to give his daughter to his sister and have Bamie, his elder sister, raise her. He later said of his exploits in Cuba that he would have left his wife\u2019s deathbed to be there, and that\u2019s not an exaggerated statement. I think that the women in his life understood that they needed to be the support system, especially emotionally, that he didn\u2019t always have the capacity to have. I think if there\u2019s one surprising thing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d in addition to the argument that TR is actually the product of women, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an incredibly emotional person, as much as he\u2019s caricatured in history. I love Robin Williams and the depiction in \u201cNight at the Museum,\u201d but that\u2019s a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt. It\u2019s easy to caricature him with the big smile and teeth and the hat and the cowboy, but he\u2019s a very sensitive, emotional person who feels very deeply. I think it\u2019s what allowed him to empathize with people. It\u2019s what allowed him to connect with people. That\u2019s all, by the way, a direct result of the influence of his mother, Mittie, who\u2019s been completely written off in history. How a wealthy person became a populist leader WOLF: The gender inequality of the day is a major takeaway from this book. But also the general inequality. Roosevelt was born into fabulous wealth. These are people that take monthslong trips to Europe when he\u2019s a child. He is never not wealthy. But then he escapes that perception to become this populist leader. When inequality is such a big issue today, how do you view his rise from that perspective? O\u2019KEEFE: Theodore Roosevelt is not a Horatio Alger story. He does not rise from humble beginnings to find his way to the upper echelons of power and wealth in America. Interestingly, the expectation in the Victorian and Gilded Age was that those with the greatest amount in society owed very little back to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, like his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, was considered a traitor to his class. It was very unusual for someone of his status and wealth to run for office. Politics was seen as a dirty business, something that the middle and lower classes, that the immigrant class would be interested in, because why would you need the power of the vote? You have wealth. You have influence. I think some of that is due to the influence of his parents, Mittie and Thee (Theodore Sr.), a Southerner and a Northerner, who were able to disagree without being disagreeable over one of the most contentious issues in American memory, the Civil War. He saw them come together as a family and be interested in the unity of their family as well as the country. He did have a noblesse oblige. He did feel that to whom much is given, much is required. And I think that experience out in the Badlands of North Dakota \u2014 where it didn\u2019t matter if you were wealthy; you were expected to work equally with the person alongside you. A horse in a roundup doesn\u2019t much care if you\u2019re from the East Side of Manhattan \u2014 you\u2019re either gonna survive and do the work or you\u2019re not gonna make it. Connecting Roosevelt to Biden WOLF: The most gripping part of the book is your description of the circumstances around his first wife dying in childbirth and his mother dying in the same house on the same day. I was trying to quantify that level of tragedy, and the first thing that popped to my mind was the current president, Joe Biden, who lost his wife and his daughter just after he was first elected to the Senate. I wonder if you also made that connection. O\u2019KEEFE: Absolutely. Loss which no one ever hopes to experience is often the crucible of an individual\u2019s life. In Theodore\u2019s circumstance, it was his mother, Mittie, after his father\u2019s death, that said, we need to live for the living, not for the dead \u2014 that you would dishonor the memory of those who are gone if you did not live a life of purpose. I think that\u2019s very similar to President Biden\u2019s circumstances, absolutely. You know, he took the seat in the Senate that then, of course, he held for 36 years, in part because it would be a dishonor to the memory of his wife and daughter if he didn\u2019t. Loss and happenstance, fate and serendipity play such an incredible role in American history. You have to look at these moments, these crucible moments, as the turning points of not just these individual political lives but how they intertwine with the fate of the nation. A new focus on 21st-century masculinity WOLF: There\u2019s been a rise recently, particularly on the American political right, of men trying to reassert masculinity. Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who wrote a book about Roosevelt, more recently has a book called \u201cManhood,\u201d for instance. What do you think Roosevelt would make of that trend? O\u2019KEEFE: It\u2019s exactly what he was experiencing at his time. When Roosevelt was born in 1858, there\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no airplanes, there\u2019s no submarines. He will be the first president to go up on an airplane, to ride a car, to travel abroad while president, to go in a submarine. Everything changes, right? The society is shifting from agrarian to industrial. The technology that is coming in this age is disrupting how people feel about their sense of self and connection and community. There\u2019s an immigration wave in the country that, in the view of many, is changing what the definition of what an American is, and there\u2019s a fierce debate about whether we\u2019re an isolationist country, or we\u2019re going to be a global power. Does any of this sound familiar? This all intersects with masculinity and gender roles, right? There are constant themes of masculinity. How to be a man. What does it mean to be a man. What do you have to physically do in order to show that you\u2019re a man. He\u2019ll project the quintessential ideal of manhood in society\u2019s expectations at the turn of the 20th century. But what I\u2019m showing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d is that he too had this incredible emotional, soft side \u2014 that it was women, who were constrained by the age, working with him to achieve his goals. To your question about what is happening now, people trying to understand gender roles, masculinity, manhood \u2014 instead of looking at it as a continuum, trying to sort of define it as one or the other, to me, it sounds very much like something I\u2019ve heard before, if you pay attention to history. The duality of Roosevelt in the killing of a dog WOLF: There\u2019s a moment in the book when Roosevelt has just had a falling-out with Edith, his childhood sweetheart, who would later become his second wife. He\u2019s riding his horse home and, in a moment of pique, shoots a neighbor\u2019s dog. As I was reading that passage, I immediately thought of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced serious backlash for writing in her memoir about shooting a family dog who was unruly. Obviously, the 19th century was a different time, but I wondered if you thought of Roosevelt when you read about Noem, a Dakota lawmaker. Is she not just living \u201cthe strenuous life?\u201d O\u2019KEEFE: There\u2019s a stark difference between a family pet, as described by the governor of South Dakota, and an animal running in the Oyster Bay woods (in New York) that was owned by a neighbor. But this is the duality of Theodore Roosevelt. If you go out to Sagamore Hill (Roosevelt\u2019s home), to this day, one of the most touching parts is the pet cemetery, where they\u2019ve got the graves of all the different, many beloved animals that they had. The Roosevelts had a menagerie, a veritable zoo at the White House \u2014 Josiah the badger and Emily Spinach, the snake whom Alice (his daughter, who was named for her mother) named because she didn\u2019t like her aunt, Emily, and she didn\u2019t like spinach, so her snake must be Emily Spinach; Algonquin, the pony who was taken up to the second floor of the White House. They had so many dogs in their home, both in Sagamore and in the White House, that the pet cemetery is filled with the names of these beloved family pets. So it\u2019s incongruous with Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s attitude about pets and animals, but yes, it is true that after he broke up with Edith, he was so angry that he did indeed shoot a dog on a horseback ride through the woods around Oyster Bay. An unusual parallel, perhaps, to today\u2019s stories.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_trump-closed-door-meeting-house-gop", "text": "Former President Donald Trump led House Republicans through a gripe-filled closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Thursday,\u00a0airing grievances about his legal and electoral challenges, attacking his critics in the room, and only briefly addressing policy matters\u00a0like abortion and taxes,\u00a0according to multiple GOP lawmakers in the room. In his first time returning to the Capitol campus area since leaving office\u00a0after the January 6, 2021, riot, the former president met with lawmakers for over an hour. In between rants about Taylor Swift and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump went after his detractors \u2013 those who have since lost their seats and some who were in the room \u2013 as he warned\u00a0Republicans\u00a0to not be afraid of the hot button issue of\u00a0abortion. In a sign that the former president is reveling in how the party has fallen in line behind him, Trump bragged that\u00a0most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him were no longer in office and singled out one of the remaining two GOP lawmakers left: GOP Rep. David Valadao of California. \u201cI never loved him,\u201d Trump said\u00a0of Valadao, according to a GOP member. As a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents. Trump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump\u2019s wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports,\u00a0to be nice to the speaker. \u201cHe\u2019s always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said \u2018are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?\u2019 He was joking. And I said \u2018eh,\u2019\u201d as she gestured with her hands. \u201cHe said \u2018OK be nice to him\u2019 and I nodded my head,\u201d she added. Johnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \u201ca very good job\u201d and that he plans to be \u201cfully prepared\u201d to implement Trump\u2019s plans if he wins in November. The former president\u2019s conviction\u00a0also\u00a0hung\u00a0heavy\u00a0over\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0meeting. Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict \u2013proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And\u00a0one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week \u2013 on the eve of Trump\u2019s Capitol Hill visit and two weeks\u00a0after his conviction. In his meeting with GOP lawmakers,\u00a0Trump\u00a0called the Department of Justice\u00a0\u201cdirty no good bastards,\u201d\u00a0according to another\u00a0source in the room. GOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the federal government being weaponized. In a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president\u2019s felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November. \u201cAnybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it\u2019s only given him even more energy,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cAnd what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they\u2019ve been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\u201d Trump tells GOP lawmakers to \u2018follow your own heart\u2019 on abortion Trump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Johnson relayed that Trump told the group to \u201cexercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\u201d Trump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions. \u201cHe talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\u201d GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \u201cAnd I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\u201d Trump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \u201cnot so good\u201d decisions. \u201cBut like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\u201d Trump said, according to a source in the room. Trump\u2019s message came as the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0rejected a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. The former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it. Trump off topic There were a number of moments where the former president went off topic. As Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee \u2013 where Republicans are holding their convention this summer \u2013 \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \u201cspecifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\u201d and not the city itself. In one bizarre moment,\u00a0Trump called Pelosi\u2019s daughter a \u201cwacko\u201d and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \u201cgreat romance\u201d in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room.. In response to Trump\u2019s comments, one of Pelosi\u2019s daughters\u00a0posted\u00a0on X: \u201cspeaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters \u2014 this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her \u2014 or the White House.\u201d He also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \u201cdope.\u201d \u201cWhy would she endorse this dope,\u201d Trump said, according to a member in the room. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to get off a stage.\u201d The former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \u201cNice guy \u2026 he even had a friend over for dinner.\u201d At the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room. Senate meeting striking a more unifying tone A few hours later, Trump met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors and \u2013 lawmakers said \u2013 struck a unifying tone. Senate Minority Leader Mitch\u00a0McConnell, who has had a distant and icy relationship with the former president and has not spoken directly to him since December 2020, said that he shook hands with Trump and that the meeting was positive. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you out of it that was negative,\u201d he said. Trump praised McConnell during the meeting, crediting the Kentucky Republican for his work to elect more GOP senators, according to a source in the room. The former president sat between McConnell and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who also has had a rocky relationship with the former president. \u201cHe is the choice of our voters overwhelmingly. It shows that he is absolutely the leader of the party,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said of Trump. \u201cI mean, you had people who have vociferously opposed him, who were sitting right next to him in the room.\u201d Trump himself praised a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Senate Republicans, saying there\u2019s \u201ctremendous unity\u201d in the GOP. Trump made a point of saying he\u2019ll stand behind GOP lawmakers in their own races, telling the senators beside him, \u201cYou\u2019re all either elected or you\u2019re going to be elected again and reelected, and I\u2019m with every one of you and you know that.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida characterized the meeting as \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d and providing the state of the former president\u2019s campaign. \u201cOptimism, but a lot of work to be done,\u201d Rubio said. Meanwhile,\u00a0Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the former president \u201cexpressed frustration\u201d over his recent conviction. \u201cHe expressed frustration over the recent trial, you can imagine, and justifiably in my view,\u201d Cornyn said. He said Trump did not bring up January 6. This story has been updated with additional developments.

Both the US Treasury Department and the US State Department took action against the Tzav 9 movement for its repeated obstruction of the aid. The sanctions against the organization are the latest punitive measure taken under an executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank. They come as the US continues to grapple with the crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian officials say the situation has reached one of its lowest points in the entire\u00a0eight-month\u00a0conflict The Tzav 9 movement, a grouping of demobilized reservists, families of hostages and settlers, has been\u00a0leading protests\u00a0to disrupt the critical aid convoys at\u00a0Kerem Shalom, the country\u2019s sole functioning border crossing with Gaza. Its name, meaning \u201cOrder 9,\u201d is a reference to the emergency mobilization notices that call up reservists. At the end of February, the area was declared a closed military zone, due to international pressure, but protesters continued to arrive and try to outmaneuver the police. \u201cFor months, individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently, along their route from Jordan to Gaza, including in the West Bank,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Friday. \u201cThey also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\u00a0 On May 13, 2024, Tzav 9 members looted and then set fire to two trucks near Hebron in the West Bank carrying humanitarian aid destined for men, women, and children in Gaza,\u201d he said. Miller said the\u00a0Israeli government\u00a0\u201chas a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian convoys transiting Israel and the West Bank enroute to Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to use all tools at our disposal to promote accountability for those who attempt or undertake such heinous acts, and we expect and urge that Israeli authorities do the same.\u201d In a statement Friday, Tzav 9 described the Biden administration\u2019s imposition of sanctions as \u201cshocking,\u201d\u00a0adding,\u00a0\u201cIt is a fatal blow to the families who aim to stop the aid to the enemy Hamas in time of war.\u201d The statement also accused the Biden administration of acting \u201cagainst the families of hostages who fight to get their loved ones back from Hamas\u2019s hands.\u201d The statement claimed without evidence that aid \u201cfalls directly into the hands of the terrorist organization Hamas.\u201d The US and humanitarian aid organizations say they are not aware of widespread diversion of humanitarian assistance by Hamas. Reuters first reported that the sanctions were being imposed. President Joe Biden signed an executive order earlier this year allowing sanctions on those causing West Bank violence. The order has been used to roll out sanctions on Israeli settlers attacking Palestinians in recent months.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts", "text": "An unprecedented two weeks of legal drama that yielded historic convictions of a former president and a sitting president\u2019s son have also produced a clear political takeaway. The survival of the rule of law in America and untainted justice may depend on the choice voters make in November. The country\u2019s divergent possible paths under President Joe Biden or presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump were highlighted in the way both men, their families and their political operations reacted to the twin trials and verdicts. Biden made no effort to interfere in the prosecution of his son Hunter with either his executive authority or with the media megaphone of his office. He allowed his own Justice Department to secure a guilty verdict Tuesday that could result in jail time for the recovering addict and hurt his own 2024 campaign. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president said after the jury found his son guilty of lying on a federal background check form and possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. He has already said he won\u2019t pardon his son. In his first reaction to the verdict, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t attack the judge or prosecutors, simply saying he was grateful for the love and support of his family and blessed to be clean again. The Bidens\u2019 comportment contrasted with Trump\u2019s reaction to his own trial and conviction nearly two weeks ago in his hush money case. The ex-president lashed out at witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and the judge. He claimed that \u201cthis was done by (the) Biden administration in order to wound or hurt a political opponent.\u201d He blasted \u201ca rigged decision,\u201d despite the fact the Justice Department was not involved in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney. Since then, Trump has been warning he\u2019d use presidential powers to punish his political opponents and bend the legal system to his will. \u201cSometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump told TV psychologist Phil McGraw last week. \u201cI have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d The former president told Fox News last week, \u201cI would have every right to go after them,\u201d referring to the Bidens. Two Trump claims discredited by Hunter Biden verdict Throughout his trial in Manhattan, his former hometown, Trump, insisted he couldn\u2019t get a fair verdict in a city that votes mostly Democratic. But Delaware is a blue state \u2014 and a jury there just convicted the president\u2019s son. One juror told CNN Tuesday that politics never came up in the deliberations. Jurors in Trump\u2019s trial have yet to speak, perhaps because of fears they could be identified following the ex-president\u2019s intimidation tactics. Had Biden been acquitted, Republicans would surely have argued that a biased jury in a state where everyone seems to know the first family had proven their point. But the guilty verdict blew another of their political arguments out of the water. Joe Biden came to office pledging to restore the independence of the Justice Department following Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to employ its legal and investigative powers almost as a personal law firm during his term. But the former president has left no doubt that he\u2019d do the same and more if he wins back the White House in November and would ignore the DOJ\u2019s core mission statement of enforcing the law with \u201cindependence and Impartiality.\u201d Trump has already vowed to prosecute Biden and his family and to \u201cobliterate\u201d what he calls the \u201cDeep State.\u201d Several outside groups have drawn up plans to help him. The Hunter Biden verdict also contradicted the central rationale of Trump\u2019s multiple legal defenses in his four criminal cases, several civil matters and his entire presidential campaign. This is the false notion that he is a victim of a weaponized legal system by a Justice Department that exclusively targets Republicans. \u201cSo much for the weaponization of the Justice Department to go after just the enemies of the other side,\u201d Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official and federal prosecutor, said on CNN Max on Tuesday. \u201cThis is testament to the fact the Justice Department under (Attorney General Merrick) Garland is trying its very best to steer straight down the middle as it should and bring people to trial that it thinks are worthy of prosecution.\u201d The notion of Justice Department neutrality was bolstered by post-trial comments from David Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware whom Garland elevated to  special counsel to avoid the impression of political bias. Weiss thanked the attorney general for allowing him to act independently. And, he added, in a coda to two fraught weeks that have dragged the justice system into toxic political waters, that \u201cno one in this country is above the law. Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant.\u201d However, Weiss added: \u201cHunter Biden should be no more accountable than any other citizen convicted of this same conduct.\u201d Ken Buck, a former Republican member of Congress, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that Joe Biden had handled the painful matter of his son\u2019s trial and conviction appropriately. \u201c(He did) a great job in trying to stay above the fray and recognizing that his Justice Department was in a very difficult position. People look at this case and realize it was done in an independent and fair way.\u201d Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor and CNN political analyst, said the criminal convictions of Trump and Hunter Biden reflected the huge stakes in November\u2019s election. \u201cNot only is (Joe Biden) saying, the decision is also one that comes from the courts, he\u2019s not saying he\u2019s going to use presidential power to somehow issue a pardon. And you contrast that with the former president who\u2019s attacked the legal system. He\u2019s questioned its legitimacy.\u201d Zelizer added: \u201cVoters will have to make a choice. What kind of response do they want? And what kind of person do they want in the Oval Office come January of 2025?\u201d The idea that the Justice Department is only going after Republicans is not just belied by the Hunter Biden conviction in the gun case and a looming tax trial that awaits him in September. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey is on trial in New York for bribery and corruption. The Justice Department in May indicted another well-known Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, and his wife for allegedly accepting around $600,000 from Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil firm and a Mexican bank in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress. Both Democrats have maintained their innocence. Nevertheless, House Republicans are scheduled to hold a vote on Wednesday on holding Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of President  Biden\u2019s interviews with former special\u00a0counsel Robert Hur. Biden has asserted executive privilege over the files. The truth is unlikely to change the GOP Biden narrative Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin highlighted the contrast between Trump and Biden. \u201cThe Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don\u2019t like the way one case came out. Whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don\u2019t hear a single Democrat crying foul,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. Yet one lesson of the Trump-era is that the truth rarely matters. The revealing of inconvenient facts never penetrates the echo chamber that dominates Republican politics and conservative media. So rather than being chastened by the collapse of the Trump persecution narrative and the successful application of the rule of law in a criminal trial, Trump supporters in Congress merely used the Biden verdict to conjure a new round of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. House Oversight Chairman James Comer said the Delaware trial was \u201ca step toward accountability.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican warned that Justice Department officials were continuing to \u201ccover for the Big Guy, Joe Biden.\u201d Comer repeated accusations that the president had profited from his son\u2019s ethically questionable business operations in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president despite the failure of his committee and the House GOP impeachment probe to find any such evidence. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach. \u201cWe will continue to demand accountability for the corrupt business dealings of the Biden family,\u201d said the Louisiana Republican, a firm supporter of Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s loss in a recent civil case that found that he, his adult sons and his organization had committed massive insurance and banking fraud. Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former White House domestic policy adviser, argued that the Justice Department had actually shown favoritism toward Hunter Biden by not charging him with 50 felonies over foreign influence peddling. The department should \u201ctell him his only way out of life in prison is to testify against the BIG GUY,\u201d Miller said on X. Some of the GOP reaction to Biden becoming a convicted felon was bizarre. One of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, baselessly suggested on X that a verdict produced by a jury of his peers was some kind of elaborate plot. \u201cHunter Biden just became the Deep State\u2019s sacrificial lamb to show that Justice is \u2018balanced\u2019 while the other Biden crimes remain ignored,\u201d she wrote on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_us-designates-nordic-neo-nazi-group-terrorists", "text": "The US State Department on Friday designated a Nordic neo-Nazi group and three of its top officials as terrorists. It\u2019s the second time in history that the US has designated a foreign\u00a0White supremacist organization and its leaders as terrorists. The department designated the Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) and three of its top\u00a0officials\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Tor Fredrik Vejdeland, P\u00e4r \u00d6berg, and Leif Robert Eklund \u2013\u00a0as Specially Designated Global Terrorists on Friday, according to a statement from spokesperson Matthew Miller. It is the first time the Biden administration has made such a designation of a\u00a0White supremacist group. The Trump administration in 2020 designated the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) and its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. NRM is a transnational neo-Nazi organization founded in Sweden in 1997,\u00a0with branches in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland, according to the State Department. It was banned in Finland in 2020. According to a State Department fact sheet, NRM was designated \u201cfor having committed or attempted to commit, posing a significant risk of committing, or having participated in training to commit acts of terrorism that threaten the security of United States nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d The designation of NRM comes as US officials have warned that\u00a0White\u00a0supremacist terror groups continue\u00a0to pose a threat at home and abroad. The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community found that the \u201ctransnational racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE) movement, in particular motivated by white supremacy, will continue to foment violence across Europe, South America, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand inspiring the lone actor or small-cell attacks that pose a significant threat to U.S. persons.\u201d \u201cNRM\u2019s violent activity is based on its openly racist, anti-immigrant, antisemitic, and anti-LGBTQI+ platform,\u201d Miller said Friday. \u201cThe group\u2019s members and leaders have carried out violent attacks against political opponents, protestors, journalists, and other perceived adversaries.\u201d \u201cNRM members have also taken steps to collect and prepare weapons and explosive materials, including on behalf of the group and in furtherance of its goals,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cIn addition, NRM has organized training in violent tactics, including hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting.\u201d The State Department said they were making the designations as \u201cpart of a broader U.S. government effort to address the transnational dimensions of the threat posed by REMVE actors and reflect the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s continued commitment to countering domestic terrorism (DT), which includes REMVE.\u201d In remarks Wednesday, a top State Department counterterrorism official warned that \u201ctransnational linkages\u201d were increasing, \u201cwith individuals and groups communicating both online and in-person, radicalizing individuals\u2014frequently young people\u2014to violence, recruiting, and sharing tactical training, including sharing instructions for making weapons.\u201d \u201cREMVE actors are becoming more and more adept at exploiting social media platforms, online gaming platforms and game-adjacent platforms, smaller websites with targeted audiences, and encrypted chat applications to recruit new followers, plan and rally ideological support, and disseminate materials that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence,\u201d said Ian Moss, the\u00a0deputy\u00a0coordinator for the Bureau of Counterterrorism. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order that gave the US government greater latitude to go after groups who train terrorists, not only groups that carry out terrorist attacks. Friday\u2019s designation will deny NRM members from accessing the US financial system, with the intention of making it more challenging for them to move money through the international system and fund their efforts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/us-designates-nordic-neo-nazi-group-terrorists/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-son-trial-analysis", "text": "It would be devastating for any parent to see a child convicted of a crime. To experience it as president before the eyes of the world, during one of the most contentious reelection campaigns in history, would be unfathomable. But that is the ordeal now confronting President Joe Biden after his only surviving son Hunter was found guilty on all counts in a trial in Delaware over his possession of a gun while being addicted to drugs. The jury delivered its verdict Tuesday less than two weeks after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump learned he had been convicted of all 34 counts in a hush money trial in New York. The double convictions represent a remarkable departure from traditional presidential campaigns. Never has a former president and presumptive major party nominee been convicted of a crime. Nor has the child of a sitting president. Both Hunter Biden and Trump pleaded not guilty. Biden\u2019s statement at the start of the trial \u2014 that \u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad\u201d \u2014 encapsulated the tension of his role as the titular head of the nation\u2019s justice system and the pain he would naturally endure from seeing a cherished son, who has dealt with addiction and worked hard to recover, go on trial in the middle of a media storm. Biden repeated that poignant line in a statement issued immediately after the verdict. And unlike former president Trump after his verdict, Biden accepted the jury\u2019s judgment and the integrity of the legal system. \u201cJill and\u00a0I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The Hunter Biden conviction is the latest cruel twist in the story of a family that has endured more tragedies than most could bear. The story of how the future president lost his first wife and infant daughter as a newly elected senator in the early 1970s and brought up his sons with his second wife, the current first lady, has become part of Biden\u2019s personal political mythology. Nearly a decade ago, Biden suffered the loss of his elder son Beau, who had brain cancer. The president\u2019s grief remains raw and often comes to the surface during public events. The trial of Hunter Biden is also occurring at a moment when the president is already under extreme pressure, amid an intensifying reelection campaign in which he is facing an opponent who he warns is bent on destroying American democracy. Biden\u2019s personal burden is, meanwhile, being exacerbated by the fact that at 81, he\u2019s the oldest president in history and opponents highlight every slip or senior moment to charge he\u2019s unfit for office. He just returned from Europe on Sunday, but heads back Wednesday for the G7 summit. And his critical first debate with Trump, on CNN on June 27, will provide the kind of test of his mental faculties and emotional fortitude to match anything any modern president seeking reelection has faced. Two vastly different cases thrust into the same political maelstrom The Hunter Biden and Trump cases are vastly different, as is the way the former and current first families have responded to the trials. For instance, there have been no daily rants by the president\u2019s son about a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d judge. Trump\u2019s conviction for falsifying financial records to cover up a payment to an adult film star, by contrast, prompted the ex-president to warn of retribution. He\u2019s also absurdly claimed he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident who compares to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela. In the latest stage of his legal morass, Trump sat through an online pre-sentencing meeting Monday that came two days after he used his Truth Social network to launch a fresh assault on the probity of the verdict he has vowed to appeal. \u201cThese are not legitimate trials; they are merely part of an illegal POLITICAL WITCH HUNT the likes of which our Country has never seen before!\u201d Trump wrote. The former president\u2019s sentencing has been set for July 11, just a few days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s sentencing is not expected to occur until October. Joe Biden, who has said he is trying to restore faith in the justice system after the Trump presidency, said in a solemn ABC News interview that he won\u2019t pardon his son. This is especially significant since Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, although a sentence for a first-time offender is unlikely to be that severe. First families in the spotlight While cameras were barred from the courtroom in both trials, each unfolded against a backdrop of taut political drama and the glare of publicity surrounding the former and current first families. The ex-president\u2019s adult sons Eric and Donald Jr. sometimes attended court in New York. And crowds of GOP lawmakers \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 were eager to embroider the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s claims that he was a victim of politicized justice in what amounts to an attack on the rule of law by a major American political party. Former first lady Melania Trump did not attend. Biden has stayed away from his son\u2019s trial in Wilmington, but first lady Jill Biden has led a gathering of the clan at the courthouse for the last week. She crossed the Atlantic four times last week, balancing her official role alongside her husband at D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations and in a state visit to France with her desire to be with her son in his hour of greatest need. In one striking moment in the trial\u2019s closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors drawn from a state where many families have a story about interacting with the Bidens that they should draw no inference from the first family\u2019s rock-solid bond and presence at the trial. \u201cPeople sitting in the gallery are not evidence. You may recognize them from the news \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d\u00a0Wise added: \u201cYour decision can only be made on evidence.\u201d The infringements on the Biden family\u2019s dignity and privacy cut deep during the trial, which saw discomforting testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s former cocaine addiction. Beau Biden\u2019s widow, Hallie, who had a relationship with Hunter as they grieved, testified about their joint cocaine use that she said now embarrasses and shames her. In a heart-rending scene, the accused\u2019s daughter, Naomi, was brought to the stand by the defense, then came under a rigorous cross-examination from prosecutors. The way addiction ravages loved ones as well as the user was laid bare when a text from Naomi to her father reading, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad, I can\u2019t take this,\u201d was introduced into evidence. Media organizations, meanwhile, played an excerpt from Hunter Biden\u2019s audio book that chronicles his spiral into addiction that was used in the prosecution case. Two politicized trials with critical differences Given the identities of those involved and the fraught national moment in the middle of a bitterly contested general election, there\u2019s no way the Trump and Hunter Biden trials could not have become politicized. Trump has claimed that he\u2019s the victim of a vendetta by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, though he was indicted by a grand jury, enjoyed the presumption of innocence like any other accused felon and was judged by a jury of his peers. When Biden\u2019s plea deal collapsed in the court of a Trump-appointed judge and when Attorney General Merrick Garland made David Weiss, the prosecutor investigating Biden, a special counsel, some Democrats asked whether Republican pressure designed to damage the president had weighed on the renewed push for a trial. But both trials have been conducted according to the rules of evidence and provided expansive protections for the accused. And the same bedrock American principle that was cited by prosecutors in the Trump hush money trial was used by Wise in his summation on Monday. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d he said, urging jurors not to treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d There is a critical difference between the two trials that debunks much of the political noise around them. Hunter Biden, unlike Trump, did not serve as president and has no chance of sitting in the Oval Office as commander in chief on January 20. While Biden is facing serious charges and will go on trial again in September in a separate tax case, his alleged offenses have nothing to do with the Constitution or threats to democracy. Trump\u2019s charges, however, focus on alleged mishandling of national security documents that he hoarded at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office. He has also been charged in two separate cases \u2014 one federal and one in Georgia \u2014 with the ultimate crime in a democracy: seeking to overturn the will of voters. The former president is waiting for a US Supreme Court ruling on his sweeping claims of immunity arising from the federal election interference case that, if the court rules his way and he wins a second term, could augur a presidency of almost no constraints that could verge on autocracy. The second distinction lies in the fact that Joe Biden\u2019s behavior is not an issue in the criminal cases against his son. And House Republicans have so far failed to find that the president benefited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals in nations like Ukraine and China while his father was vice president \u2014 even if the younger Biden\u2019s activity raises serious ethical questions.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-investigation-what-matters", "text": "It was nearly a year ago that CNN first reported about a cover-up at the Coast Guard Academy. That initial report about how the academy kept secret its own review of decades of sexual assault cover-ups continues to reverberate. This week, the Coast Guard Academy official in charge of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, resigned in protest and said the Coast Guard had made her an unwitting accomplice to a cover-up. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable,\u201d Norenberg said in a statement. Watch her appearance on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d. Separately, the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is scheduled to testify about the scandal on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where she will face tough questioning about why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. How does investigative reporting like this come to be? It took a team of\u00a0journalists\u00a0from CNN Investigates,\u00a0including Melanie Hicken,\u00a0Blake Ellis, Audrey Ash, Curt Devine and Pamela Brown. I emailed with Hicken and Ellis, reporters who have been working on this story since the beginning. Our conversation is below. WOLF: You\u2019ve been covering this Coast Guard story for some time. What was the first thread you pulled on it, and how has it unraveled? HICKEN and ELLIS: Our Coast Guard reporting all started with a young woman named Hope Hicks who was a student at a different service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy. In an anonymous blog post, she wrote about how she had been raped by her boss while out at sea \u2013 prompting a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry. As we started digging into her case, we became fascinated by this little-known industry.\u00a0We\u00a0spent months talking to merchant mariners who were assaulted while working on commercial ships and learned more about how the justice process works in the commercial shipping world \u2013\u00a0ultimately discovering that a number of sexual assaults were going unpunished and that it was all happening under the Coast Guard\u2019s watch.\u00a0So, that was the turning point where we started turning our attention to the Coast Guard. It is only because of this initial reporting on the Coast Guard and the maritime industry that we were able to ultimately break the news of the Fouled Anchor scandal. It took months to develop the trust of sources, obtain key records\u00a0and conduct sensitive interviews with victims. WOLF: A key part of the story is Operation Fouled Anchor, the secret internal probe of cover-ups. Has the Coast Guard acknowledged a cover-up?\u00a0 HICKEN and ELLIS: Reporting on this story has been so interesting because Fouled Anchor essentially ended up being a cover-up of past cover-ups.\u00a0The internal probe substantiated years of sexual assault at the US Coast Guard Academy and revealed how victims\u2019 complaints were ignored and, at times, covered up \u2013 allowing some offenders to rise to high-level positions in the Coast Guard and other military branches. Through our reporting, we learned that while there were originally plans to come clean to Congress about the reporting and its damning findings, Coast Guard leaders ultimately chose to bury it \u2013 even going so far as to make a list of pros and cons of disclosure. The Coast Guard\u2019s current leader has apologized to the workforce and Congress but has been careful to avoid calling the suppression of the Fouled Anchor investigation a cover-up. WOLF: Has there been any follow-up to look at some of those assaults from years ago? HICKEN and ELLIS: Operation Fouled Anchor itself was launched in 2014 to look at those earlier assaults when an academy graduate claimed that her allegations of rape from years earlier had never been investigated and her attacker had gone on to become a top officer in the Air Force. Despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, Fouled Anchor investigators found that most of the alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated at the time. Even after the cases were reopened during Fouled Anchor however, few alleged perpetrators were held accountable. The assailant in the case that started Fouled Anchor was the only person to face criminal charges in military court as a result of the probe, but an appeals court ended up ruling in his favor and dismissing the charges, saying that the military had missed its window to prosecute because the Coast Guard waited nearly two decades to investigate the victim\u2019s allegations. We learned that two other accused perpetrators were discreetly pushed to retire from the Coast Guard, but that there were nearly 40 cases where the Coast Guard no longer had jurisdiction over the alleged attackers and local and federal criminal statutes had long run out of time, so no action was taken at all. In terms of what is happening now, we know that the Coast Guard is currently investigating an officer for sexually harassing and groping a cadet who reported him to the academy two decades earlier\u00a0at the Coast Guard Academy (the officer\u2019s attorney denies the allegations). The former cadet brought up the allegations during\u00a0testimony\u00a0at a congressional hearing last year, but the Coast Guard didn\u2019t launch the criminal investigation until months later, after the woman said she flagged his name on a promotion list to senators. Another woman has asked Congress to reopen her rape case from 2005, which the Coast Guard has claimed it cannot pursue despite findings at the time that he had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her since he is not currently under Coast Guard jurisdiction. WOLF: There\u2019s a hearing in Congress this week. Shannon Norenberg resigned in protest. Has there been any accountability yet at the Coast Guard Academy or in the Coast Guard? HICKEN and ELLIS: It sounds like the Coast Guard\u2019s current leader, Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, will be facing a lot of tough questions at the hearing. So far, she has wanted the agency to focus on the future and make changes to policies that she hopes will help prevent sexual assault and better support survivors. But many Coast Guard members are frustrated by two major issues: that to date, the leaders who covered up Operation Fouled Anchor still haven\u2019t been held accountable and that Fagan is not acknowledging how much of an issue sexual assault still is in the service today. Shannon Norenberg was angry that she was used as part of what she described as a \u201ccruel coverup\u201d where victims and Congress were both deceived, but she is also frustrated that more hasn\u2019t changed at the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 saying perpetrators are still facing little accountability. WOLF: Having covered this for so long, what is it about the Coast Guard Academy that allowed this kind of cover-up culture to develop? Is this a problem specific to the Coast Guard or the academy? HICKEN and ELLIS: Many of the issues we have seen playing out at the Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard at large, such as fear of retaliation for speaking out about assaults, a lack of accountability for alleged perpetrators and a boys-club culture, were very similar to what we heard from those in the US Merchant Marine Academy community when we first started this reporting several years ago. We have also heard from assault survivors from across the military service who argue that our country still has a long way to go in combating military sexual assault and attempting to make survivors whole. We have also been told by some in the organization that because the Coast Guard does not fall under the Department of Defense, like the other military branches, that it has historically escaped the same level of scrutiny. Many are hopeful that maybe that can change with people who have been terrified to speak up finally feeling like they can. WOLF: You include your email addresses at the end of your stories and ask for tips to investigate. Does that ever turn into stories? HICKEN and ELLIS: Yes! We have received so much helpful information through tips in response to our stories, and many of the sexual assault survivors we have spoken with throughout our reporting originally contacted us through our tips email (watchdog@cnn.com). Many current and former Coast Guard employees have also shared information with us anonymously that has hugely informed our reporting and led to multiple follow-up stories. We\u2019re always looking for new story ideas, and a variety of our past investigations have stemmed from tips from readers, so we welcome emails!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/coast-guard-investigation-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_felons-inmates-voting-what-matters", "text": "Both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, face sentencing for nonviolent felonies before Election Day. Although it seems unlikely either will be behind bars on November 5, it\u2019s worth noting that how and whether felons and people otherwise detained can cast election ballots has developed into a major civil rights issue in recent years. The rules for how felons, inmates and those facing trial can cast ballots vary from state to state, and a number of recently enacted laws and ballot initiatives will change things further in 2024. In California, where Hunter Biden lives, for instance, only people who are serving time in prison are ineligible to vote, according to a database maintained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In Delaware, where he was convicted in federal court, there are more restrictions on felons voting. In Florida, where Trump lives, there are more restrictions on felons voting than in New York, where Trump was convicted in state court. There are only a few places \u2013 Vermont, Maine and the District of Colombia \u2013 where everyone can vote, even if they\u2019re convicted felons serving time in prison. Everywhere else in the US places prohibitions on incarcerated felons, and some states include other prohibitions. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Kimberly Berryman traveled to Nevada, where Tuesday was primary day and, for the first time, people who are detained, for a variety of reasons, were able to vote despite their incarceration. They met inmates casting ballots for the first time in their lives. Watch their full report. Nevada\u2019s state government gave felons who\u00a0have been released from prison the ability to vote back in 2019. That still left a population of people who are not convicted of a felony but are detained in jail in the lurch. A new law passed this year in Nevada required jails to facilitate access to voting for those non-felons inside jails in the state. Tuesday\u2019s primary was the first test. \u201cTheir vote should not be any less important than the individuals that are out here,\u201d Sadmira Ramic, a voting rights staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, told Murray and Berryman. \u201cThey face those barriers that we here on the outside don\u2019t even really think about.\u201d One major issue is confusion. Unfounded allegations of illegitimate and illegal votes or outright rigged elections have caused confusion among inmates about where they stand, so they often don\u2019t vote at all. For instance, despite Florida voters overwhelmingly agreeing in 2018 to reenfranchise felons in that state, a series of actions by the legislature complicated voting for felons, leading to court battles and confusion. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, made a show of trying to prosecute people for illegally voting in 2022. The ACLU has worked with voting rights groups in Nevada to make sure detained people who have the right to vote can access that right this year, but at one point threatened a lawsuit in order to make sure access to polling booths was granted by primary day. In a presidential election that could be decided by a small fraction of votes in key states like Nevada, even a small number of additional votes could, in theory, change the outcome. Nevada is also the site of a hotly contested Senate race that could determine which party controls the Senate next year. Jagada Chambers, a former inmate who is now a rights restoration coordinator for Silver State Voices, a voting rights group, told Murray and Berryman she hopes politicians will see the potential of asking for the votes of people who are detained. \u201cIn Clark County, you have potential victories lying in those cells,\u201d Chambers said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/felons-inmates-voting-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
