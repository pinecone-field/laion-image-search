{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_takeaways-biden-nato-news-conference", "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday participated in the most high-stakes news conference of his political career on the sidelines of the NATO summit, aiming to convince his detractors and supporters that he is able to serve another four years in office. Biden spoke for just under an hour, calling on 10 reporters and answering 19 questions. Here are some takeaways from the news conference. Performance serves as a Rorschach test for nervous Democrats Biden\u2019s performance likely won\u2019t change many minds \u2013 Democrats who want Biden to step down are able to jump on a notable verbal gaffe he made at the beginning of the news conference, while Biden\u2019s supporters will point toward the time he spent deftly answering a variety of questions on foreign policy. Toward the beginning of the question-and-answer, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as former President Donald Trump. It was exactly the type of slip-up the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign presumably would have feared amid mounting questions surrounding his mental acuity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president did I think she was not qualified to be president,\u201d he said. The president did not correct himself. He made a similar mistake earlier in the day, accidentally calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cPresident Putin\u201d while introducing him during a NATO event. But Biden quickly moved on, and he spent the rest of the news conference lobbing in-depth answers about questions including Russia, Israel and his economy, offering deep answers on dealing with China and US policy around Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. Biden eagerly takes on Trump Part of Biden\u2019s problem at the debate last month is that he was not able to effectively counter Trump, call out the former president\u2019s lies and distinguish himself from his predecessor while he was standing just feet away from him. He didn\u2019t have the same problem on Thursday, lashing out at Trump\u2019s record and his lack of public events since the debate. \u201cMy schedule has been full bore. I\u2019ve done \u2014 where\u2019s\u00a0Trump\u00a0been? Riding on his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball? I mean, look. He\u2019s done virtually nothing,\u201d Biden said. But Trump hasn\u2019t had to do anything since then. With the bulk of the national attention on Biden and his missteps, Trump and his campaign have made a strategic point of letting the president continue digging himself in a hole. During multiple answers, Biden turned the focus onto his opponent and even took him on during the opening statement of the news conference. Much of Biden\u2019s focus at the NATO summit was to promote how he had united the alliance after Trump did much to divide it during his term. Biden\u00a0told reporters said foreign leaders he\u2019s met at the\u00a0conference haven\u2019t expressed concerns over his fitness for office, instead expressing concern over the prospect of a second\u00a0Trump\u00a0term. \u201cI think I can I say this without sounding too self-serving\u2013 I\u2019ve not had any of my European allies come up to me and say, \u2018Joe don\u2019t run,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I hear them say is, you gotta win \u2013 you can\u2019t have this guy come forward, he\u2019d be a disaster, he\u2019d be a disaster.\u201d Biden brushes off concerns about his campaign: \u2018I\u2019m just gonna keep moving\u2019 Biden frequently brushed aside concerns about his candidacy by telling reporters he\u2019s the most qualified person to run for president. On occasions, he sounded downright mad and offended by the questions over his fitness for office and the state of his campaign. \u201cI think I\u2019m the\u00a0most\u00a0qualified\u00a0person to run for president. I beat him once and I will beat him again,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump. He continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign and so I \u2013 I\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d The length of Biden\u2019s resume has never been in doubt. The president has had more political experience than any one who has ever held or ran for the office. But what\u2019s of concern to those calling for him to step aside is not his qualifications, but his ability to govern for another term. Sixteen House Democrats have called on Biden to step aside - four of them doing so on Thursday before the news conference. But that still only represents less than 10% of the House Democratic caucus. It\u2019s no longer only the \u2018Lord Almighty\u2019 who could convince Biden to drop out One week ago, Biden defiantly swatted away any notion that he would drop from the race, telling ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could convince him to remove himself from the ticket. Biden was more restrained on Thursday. He reiterated his belief that he is the best qualified to win in November \u2013 while still admitting other Democrats could defeat Trump. Biden said his advantage against those Democrats is that they won\u2019t have to start a national campaign from scratch. \u201cI believe I\u2019m the best qualified to govern. And I think I\u2019m the best qualified to win. But there are other people could beat Trump too. But it\u2019s awful hard to start from scratch. And you know, we talk about, you know, money raised \u2013 we\u2019re not doing bad. We\u2019re gonna put $220 million in the bank. We\u2019re doing well,\u201d he said. Pressed on whether he might reconsider his stance if he was shown data that had Harris performing better against Trump, he offered some openness to that possibility. \u201cNo, unless they came back and said there\u2019s no way you can win,\u201d Biden said. That\u2019s a much different answer from last week, and signifies the intense conversations Biden has been having with his top aides since the ABC interview. The president also said that delegates at the Democratic National Convention next month could vote their conscience for another candidate if they so choose. But, he reiterated his belief that such a scenario would not happen. He acknowledged that down-ballot Democrats may continue to disavow his name at the top of the ticket as they face tough reelection battles. \u201cIf they think that running with Biden at the top is going to hurt them, then they\u2019re going to run away,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI get it.\u201d News conference doesn\u2019t stop the bleeding as more Dems defect from Biden If the news conference was aimed at keeping lawmakers from abandoning the president, it was not successful. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim\u00a0Himes, called on Biden to step aside almost at the exact time the news conference ended. He was the first House Democrat to call on the president to leave the ticket after the news conference, but not the last. \u201cIt is because of those traits and, and in consideration of that legacy, that I hope President Biden will step away from the presidential campaign,\u201d\u00a0he said on X. Not long after Himes, California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters issued his own call for Biden to withdraw his candidacy. Peters is a prominent Democrat among the center-left. \u201cToday I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign,\u201d the San Diego Democrat wrote in a statement shared with CNN. Illinois Rep. Eric Sorensen soon after became the 17th Democrat on Capitol Hill to call for the president to step aside. \u201cIn 2020, Joe Biden ran for President with the purpose of putting country over party. Today, I am asking him to do that again,\u201d\u00a0Sorensen said in a statement on X. \u201cI am hopeful President Biden will step aside in his campaign for President.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democratic-fears-biden-landslide-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden and his advisers keep issuing unequivocal declarations that he\u2019s staying in the 2024 race, but Democrats aren\u2019t hearing it. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d repeating her position of a week ago as if Biden had not made any declaration at all. \u201cSpeaker\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do,\u201d a spokesperson said in a subsequent statement. But the comments from such a senior member of the party had already essentially reopened the debate about whether Biden should go. Vermont Sen. Peter Welch on Wednesday evening became the first Democratic senator \u2014 and the 10th congressional Democrat \u2014 to call for Biden to step aside as the nominee, writing in a Washington Post op-ed, \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d That all came on the heels of Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet on Tuesday evening voicing the concerns other Democrats have shared privately. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith from Washington, agreed with that landslide assessment and implored Biden to reconsider. \u201cDon\u2019t let this be your legacy, that you refused to step down and got him back in the White House,\u201d Smith said, referring to Trump, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cthe Situation Room.\u201d And New York Rep. Ritchie Torres \u2014 a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been strongly supportive of Biden \u2014 put the potential down-ballot effects of a Biden candidacy bluntly. \u201cIf we are going on a political\u00a0suicide\u00a0mission, then we should at least be honest about it,\u201d he told CNN. Clooney: step aside to \u2018save\u2019 democracy George Clooney, the actor and Democratic fundraiser, is a Biden ally who spent time with him in Los Angeles and cohosted a record-breaking fundraiser for the president\u2019s campaign recently. The Biden that disastrously appeared on the debate stage is the same one that he saw in California, Clooney wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday. Now he argues that Biden needs to step aside so that capable Democrats can come forward to compete for the nomination or face losing control of the entire government. Democrats have been so \u201cterrified\u201d of a second Trump term that they ignored warning signs about Biden during the primary, Clooney said. \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\u201d Clooney wrote, appealing to Biden\u2019s sense of duty. He\u2019s not the only bold-faced Hollywood name raising the alarm. Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas, both Democratic fundraisers, are also on the record. And there are other fundraising concerns: Organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. A test every day Biden told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos during a high-stakes interview last week that he doesn\u2019t need to take a cognitive test and prove his fitness to lead because every day in the presidency is a cognitive test. That\u2019s going to be Biden\u2019s curse going forward. No matter how many fiery teleprompter speeches he gives, he likely won\u2019t be able to suddenly walk without shuffling or talk in conversation with the steadiness he once did. The next of his daily tests will come Thursday, when the president conducts a rare solo news conference at the conclusion of a NATO meeting taking place in Washington. Biden should be talking about his successful efforts to expand the treaty organization and mobilize it to stand up to Russia, but instead he will face question after question about his fitness to do the job. Stephanopoulos, by the way, who spent time in direct contact with the president, told a passerby secretly recording him on a New York City street that he doesn\u2019t think Biden can serve another four years. Next week, Biden will sit down with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt for an interview that will tape and air\u00a0Monday, the network announced Fear of a \u2018landslide\u2019 Bennet, the Colorado Democrat, became the first senator in his party to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester \u2014 the two most vulnerable senators facing reelection \u2014 also said Biden would not win during a meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar, CNN reported Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country,\u201d Bennet said on CNN. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s critically important, for us, to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\u201d Democrats are already in a difficult position in the race to control the Senate, since they are defending a larger number of seats than Republicans this cycle. About a third of the Senate is up for election every two years. CNN\u2019s senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein argued Tuesday that a Biden loss could cost Democrats the Senate, which would reverberate for decades since it would give aging conservative justices on the Supreme Court, like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, cover to resign and solidify the court\u2019s conservative majority. Trump is currently ahead CNN\u2019s Road to 270 assessment of the electoral map shows Trump in position to win the election. Georgia, Michigan and Nevada \u2014 all states that Biden won in 2020 \u2014 are all leaning toward Republicans. If Trump wins those three state and all the states he won in 2020, he would have 272 electoral votes, enough to win the election. CNN Senior data reporter Harry Enten said polling clearly shows Trump is ahead at this point. But he notes that polling this far from the election does not generally represent the final vote. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at this data we should keep in mind that it\u2019s still just July and the election is in November,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how things shift as things go on from here.\u201d Is Biden hearing this? The Democratic leader in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, has publicly backed Biden, but he has told nervous lawmakers he will take their concerns to the White House, according to CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju. But Jeffries\u00a0brushed off questions about whether Biden is the most effective nominee and said he has no plans to meet with him on Wednesday. \u201cOver the last few days, the members of the House Democratic Caucus have had conversations that are candid, constructive and clear-eyed about the path forward, which primarily includes doing everything we can to make sure that we take back the majority in November of this year,\u201d he told reporters on his way into a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some Democrats want to move on from this debate, worrying that it only boosts Trump. \u201cDonald Trump and the Republicans have loved every minute of watching this discussion,\u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents the battleground state of Michigan, told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_social-security-trump-rnc-platform", "text": "\ufeffProtecting Social Security is among the top promises that former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee say they\u2019ll \u201caccomplish very quickly\u201d if they win control of the White House and Congress in November\u2019s election. \u201cFIGHT FOR AND PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NO CUTS, INCLUDING NO CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE,\u201d the platform reads.  However, this promise leaves Trump and the GOP with few options to address the looming shortfalls in both entitlements programs. The solutions floated typically include cutting or slowing the growth of benefits, raising the retirement age or hiking payroll taxes either by increasing the rate for everyone or lifting the threshold on income subjected to the levy \u2013 though Republicans have generally been opposed to raising payroll taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s not a genuine policy prescription to save Social Security,\u201d Jason Fichtner, chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former acting deputy commissioner of Social Security, said of the party platform. \u201cIt avoids putting up any changes for another four years. That just means that any changes that we have to do will be larger.\u201d Congress doesn\u2019t have a lot of time left to figure out how to save the beloved programs. The combined Social Security trust funds \u2013 which help support monthly payments to the elderly, survivors and people with disabilities \u2013 are expected to be exhausted in 2035, according to its trustees\u2019 annual report. After that, payroll tax revenue and other income sources will only be able to cover 83% of benefits owed. Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund, known as Medicare Part A, will only be able to pay 89% of scheduled benefits in 2036. By promising not to cut Social Security benefits or change the retirement age, which many advocates consider a benefit cut, Trump is not leaving himself any wiggle room, said Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s preference is to never cut benefits for anyone at any time, which just mathematically means a lot more money going into the program,\u201d said Biggs, who served as the principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration before joining the institute. Shoring up Social Security by increasing revenue would require a sizable tax increase. The program\u2019s trustees calculated that the payroll tax rate would have to immediately increase by 3.33% to 15.73% or, if nothing is done until the trust funds are depleted, the hike would be 4.02% to 16.42%. Likewise, Medicare\u2019s payroll tax would would have to immediately increase from 2.9% to 3.25%, according to its trustees. President Joe Biden has also promised not to cut benefits. Instead, he has proposed raising taxes on higher-income Americans to put the entitlement programs on firmer financial footing. While he has released a more concrete plan to address Medicare\u2019s solvency problem, he has provided fewer details on fully fixing Social Security\u2019s fiscal woes. Both candidates have painted themselves into a corner by saying they won\u2019t cut benefits, said Biggs. \u201cNever before have the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates been closer in their positions on Social Security,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/politics/social-security-trump-rnc-platform/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Read the full text of the letter below: Melania TrumpJuly 14, 2024 I am thinking of you, now, my fellow Americans. We have always been a unique union. America, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered, but our courage and common sense must ascend and bring us back together as one. When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron\u2019s life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband. To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy. Your need to summon your inner strength for such a terrible reason saddens me. A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald\u2019s passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband\u2019s life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times. Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love. Our personal, structural, and life commitment - until death - is at serious risk. Political concepts are simple when compared to us, human beings. We are all humans, and fundamentally, instinctively, we want to help one another. American politics are only one vehicle that can uplift our communities. Love, compassion, kindness and empathy are necessities. And let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here, in this earthly realm. Dawn is here again. Let us reunite. Now. This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again. I am thinking of you, my fellow Americans. The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide \u2013 thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/melania-trump-statement-after-rally-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In an episode released Friday, Dan Pfeiffer called it \u201cinfuriating\u201d to think that he and co-host Jon Favreau, both former Barack Obama aides, are questioning whether Joe Biden can win out of \u201cpersonal animus.\u201d It\u2019s the latest episode of Democratic infighting since the president\u2019s disastrous debate performance in June kicked off a flurry of calls for the president to withdraw. \u201cThe incompetence of spending your time fighting \u2018Pod Save America,\u2019 David Axelrod, George Clooney, and the most popular figure in the Democratic Party at a time when you were struggling with Black voters is f**king insane,\u201d Pfeiffer said, referring to Obama. A New York Times report Wednesday described Biden\u2019s advisers as dismissing the \u201cPod Save America\u201d co-hosts as \u201coperatives who worked for a cerebral, cool-guy president and never understood the world according to the scrappy kid from Scranton.\u201d Favreau said that Biden\u2019s team has \u201cbigger f**king fish to fry.\u201d \u201cWhat are you spending time on us for?

More than a dozen House Democrats and one Democratic senator have asked the president to step aside. Meanwhile, many anxious Democratic donors are withholding big checks, and George Clooney, one of Biden\u2019s biggest supporters, publicly called for him to bow out earlier this week. The president, for his part, has vowed to continue.

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters", "text": "Which one of these candidates is facing calls from members of their own party to step aside in the presidential race: \u25ba Is it the recently convicted felon, also indicted for election interference and mishandling classified documents, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation as well as lying about his net worth to get loans tied to his massive real estate portfolio? \u25ba Or is it the incumbent president with a recent record of accomplishment in a bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a dubiously named piece of legislation that nonetheless addressed many of his party\u2019s priorities, like climate change? Both men are well into retirement age. Both ramble through answers to questions when they bother to take them. Both mix up names. Neither took part in debates during a primary season in which they racked up wins. And yet one of the men, former President Donald Trump, 78, has been able to remake the Republican Party around his own divisive persona. The other, President Joe Biden, 81, has now spent weeks defiantly defending his fitness for the job, slowly emerging from a protective bubble at the White House after a disastrous debate and spotty subsequent interviews. The next week will offer a fresh look at what must feel like a cruel dichotomy to Biden supporters. The GOP is now built around Trump When the Republican National Convention gets underway Monday, it will show off a speaking schedule full of far right personalities and an official party platform rewritten and simplified around Trump\u2019s priorities. Trump, between now and then, will pick a vice president from a short list of people who have previously criticized him but are now all in. In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination with insults about the size of Trump\u2019s hands, calling him a con man and arguing he couldn\u2019t be trusted with nuclear codes. Now Rubio is a Trump convert. So is Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who went from never-Trumper to true believer. Some Democrats are moving in an opposite direction. Longtime supporters now want Biden out of the race for fear he can\u2019t beat Trump, which\u00a0is\u00a0the one and only goal of Democrats afraid of his return to the White House. In any event, Rubio and Vance, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who are also reportedly on Trump\u2019s vice presidential short list, should be wary. His previous vice president, Mike Pence, is among the many people who served in Trump\u2019s first White House who have not endorsed Trump\u2019s latest election bid after an angry mob, inspired by Trump, stormed the Capitol with chants of \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Republicans had the opportunity to go a different direction. A CNN poll released back in February, before Trump had sealed the Republican presidential nomination, suggested his top Republican rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would fare much better in a head-to-head contest with Biden. Republican primary voters doubled down, decisively, on Trump. One of Haley\u2019s major policy proposals was a test for for older candidates like Biden and Trump, a prescient idea since Biden is now facing calls that he take a cognitive test and Trump has bragged that he could easily pass one. Still trying to convince fellow Democrats While Trump eyes a convention to celebrate his dominance next week, Biden is fighting back the argument that Democratic convention delegates should pick a younger successor next month. The latest in a series of public tests of Biden\u2019s abilities will be another interview with a network news anchor, NBC this time, broadcast in prime time on Monday. It\u2019s late in the election cycle for Democrats to be having this conversation, since the primary season has ended, their convention takes place next month and Trump is currently thought to have an advantage in key states heading into the November election. There are some indications Biden is regaining some support among key Democrats. While over a dozen lawmakers have called on him to drop out, with the number continuing to rise Friday, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime ally, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that the conversation about Biden\u2019s fitness needs to end before it hurts the party. \u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 with Biden,\u201d Clyburn said. If Biden dropped out, Clyburn said he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Progressives lawmakers, people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent \u2013 not Biden\u2019s natural allies on the policy front \u2013 are also standing up for Biden, arguing the party should rally around him and mobilize for November. Biden, meanwhile, despite the majority of polling that suggests he trails Trump in key states likely to decide the election, said at a rare news conference Thursday that he hasn\u2019t been shown polling data that suggests he would lose in November. The fact that he said polling data could theoretically convince him to leave the race is an adjustment from last week, when he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d could sway him. A bridge no more Biden also said at the news conference that he had changed his mind about a 2020 pledge to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between his older generation of lawmakers and and a new generation of leaders. \u201cWhat I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom and know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\u201d he said. Convinced he can beat Trump Biden also clearly believes that he is still the best person to beat Trump \u2013 the motivating principle for any Democrat these days \u2013 and Biden has been shocked during his presidency at the staying power of Trump and the MAGA turn of the GOP. \u201cHe thought it would be in the rearview mirror by now,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a recent book about Biden\u2019s presidency, \u201cThe Fight of His Life,\u201d speaking to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was necessarily planning to be a two-term president, but now that Trump is the alternative, Joe Biden really believes in his bones that he\u2019s the guy to beat him,\u201d Whipple said. In an odd twist, then, the thing keeping Biden in the race may be the very thing that has caused other Democrats to call for him to drop out.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_joe-biden-candidacy-democrats", "text": "President Joe Biden is launching a delayed outreach campaign to key groups of lawmakers \u2013 the kind of effort Democrats have long called for \u2013 after he met Thursday with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries following the president\u2019s closely watched solo news conference. In the meeting, Jeffries \u201cdirectly expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward that the Caucus has shared in our recent time together,\u201d the New York Democrat wrote in a letter to his colleagues on Friday. But Jeffries did not offer Biden one key thing: His endorsement. A person familiar with the meeting said\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0\u201cbluntly\u201d shared the views of the caucus \u2013 as he stated in his letter \u2013 but intentionally did not offer an endorsement or say publicly that the decision is Biden\u2019s to make. While it is uncertain if Biden directly asked\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0for his tacit endorsement, a person familiar with the matter said,\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0did not extend it at the meeting or in the public letter released Friday morning. Following the conversation, the president has embarked on a series of calls to key groups of Democratic lawmakers \u2013 the kind of enterprise that many in Congress asked him to make weeks ago following his disastrous debate performance. CNN reported Friday that Biden had calls with the political wings of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Friday and a Saturday virtual meeting with both the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to sources familiar with those meetings. Ahead of those meetings, defections in Biden\u2019s Democratic coalition in Congress continued. Biden\u2019s performance during his news conference, which lasted just under an hour and during which he fielded 19 questions from reporters on topics ranging from his mental capabilities to foreign policy, was much stronger than his appearance during the CNN presidential debate, but it did not stem the steady stream of House Democrats coming out against Biden\u2019s efforts to seek a second term. More than a dozen Democratic House members and at least one Democratic senator have publicly called on Biden to withdraw from his reelection campaign. That list includes multiple House members in the nation\u2019s most competitive congressional districts, but also senior Democrats on influential committees and members in safely Democratic seats. One of those Democrats, Rep. Mike Levin of California, told Biden directly on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus call that he should step aside, according to someone briefed on the call, which Biden joined an hour late. It\u2019s the first time CNN has reported on a member of Congress directly telling Biden to drop out of the race. Biden responded saying that it was important for him to get out in front of people and let them know that he was still moving well and healthy, according to a source briefed on the call. Dozens of other Democrats have stopped short of calling for Biden to end his campaign, but have either expressed concerns about Biden\u2019s chances, said he\u2019ll lose out right or remain publicly undecided. Still, more than 70 members of the House and Senate have publicly reaffirmed their support for Biden as the party\u2019s presidential nominee following his disastrous debate performance late last month. The top Democrats in Congress \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Jeffries \u2013 have made a series of public statement supporting Biden\u2019s bid this week. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 who remains in Congress and is among the most influential members of the party \u2013 has privately expressed her concerns, CNN reported Thursday night. Speaking with reporters on Friday, Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler acknowledged \u201canxiety\u201d from Capitol Hill, but insisted Biden will continue outreach to lawmakers to shore up his support. \u201cDoes there continue to be anxiety? Yes, we understand that, the president understands that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s gonna continue to engage with folks on the Hill, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve engaged with governors, mayors across the country, the vast majority of whom are firmly behind Joe Biden and understand the stakes in this election Biden on Thursday night was able to provide incisive remarks on everything from Israel to Russia to China to gun control in the United States. But he also had two notable flubs: During a NATO event before the presser, Biden introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cPresident Putin,\u201d and repeated a similar mistake during the presser, using Donald Trump\u2019s name to refer to Vice President Kamala Harris. The evening served as a sort of Rorschach test for Democrats\u2019 feelings on Biden. Those who remain firmly in his corner seized on his extended answers on wonky foreign policy issues to prove he still has what it takes to lead the country effectively, while his Democratic doubters used his verbal miscues to reinforce their calls for someone to replace the president on the top of the ticket. Biden, for his part, came off as chastened during the news conference and was less defiant than in previous appearances. While he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos last week that only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could convince him to remove himself from the race, Biden on Thursday night opened the door for other scenarios in which he would drop out of the contest. Pressed on whether he might reconsider his stance if he was shown data that had Harris performing better against Trump, he offered some openness to that possibility. \u201cNo, unless they came back and said there\u2019s no way you can win,\u201d Biden said. A Biden ally who has spoken with the president multiple times following the June 27 debate told CNN that since that ABC News interview, concerns about the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d comments have been conveyed to the president. \u201cAre you really so absolutely inflexible that even if we brought you compelling polling, you wouldn\u2019t move?\u201d is how the ally described the feedback that has been shared with Biden. And it has been impressed upon the president, they said, that \u201cit\u2019s important for him to continue to show openness.\u201d The source acknowledged that Biden heard the criticism and appears to be shifting his approach by trying to turn down his instinct of: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to push me aside.\u201d \u201cHe heard that level of fierce determination was misread by folks and he\u2019s not an arrogant\u00a0man,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201che was genuinely surprised\u201d by the criticism. Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has bluntly acknowledged the challenges it has faced since his debate performance two weeks ago. Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon acknowledged to staff in a call Thursday that the period after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance have been \u201chard,\u201d \u201cvery bad\u201d and \u201cbad f***ing weeks,\u201d a source who was on the call said. Some of the details of what O\u2019Malley Dillon said were first reported by Axios. O\u2019Malley Dillon acknowledged when she fumbled words that she had not slept much recently. She tried to rally the troops on this call after first bluntly accepting that the most recent stretch has been deeply challenging, the source said. Her case, as this source described it, was: \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we feel like we can win. We have a plan to get there.\u201d She laid out both external and internal polling numbers, and made the case that the data still backs up that Biden can defeat Trump. O\u2019Malley Dillon argued to her team that the Biden reelection campaign is going through a moment that they are \u201cbuilt for,\u201d and that it is because of the team that the president would ultimately win.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_biden-democrats-analysis", "text": "A staggering 24 hours that cracked the political foundation of Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid leave him facing the most high-pressure presidential news conference in modern history on Thursday. The stakes for Biden\u2019s solo appearance at the conclusion of the NATO summit multiplied by the hour as his political position unraveled at a dignity-sapping rate. Supporters from Congress to Hollywood warned that he needed to step aside for the sake of party and country, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a clear signal that a recalcitrant president should rethink his options. The rebellion, joined by just a small minority of congressional Democrats but appearing to run deeper, reflects the fear now surging through Capitol Hill that ex-President Donald Trump could conjure a GOP landslide that sweeps conservatives to a monopoly on power in Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court. Some Democrats fear that the 81-year-old Biden\u2019s determination to run again, despite the diminished skills exposed by the debate, could endanger the very democracy that he says he\u2019s trying to save. The president \u2014 who was in poor political shape even before the disastrous debate \u2014 is adamant that he won\u2019t pass the torch to a younger Democrat. But three factors could make his position untenable: a fracturing of support in his party; the drying up of fundraising; and damning polling data. As Biden greeted world leaders at the NATO summit on Wednesday and led discussions about how to save Ukraine, pieces were falling into place that could make this fateful trifecta a reality. Nothing less than Biden\u2019s hopes of a second term will be on the line at the news conference exactly two weeks after his incoherent and dazed debate performance sent his campaign into free fall. It\u2019s the latest in a series of public events that have turned into excruciating examinations of Biden\u2019s health and cognitive capacity, during which any slip up or confusion could trigger political disaster. Any sign his reasoning or performance are fogged by age would reinforce an impression of presidential infirmity seared into the national consciousness at the CNN debate and could inflame a stunning Democratic revolt. The ground is shifting under the president The day began with Pelosi, still a key party power broker, contradicting Biden\u2019s insistence that the matters of his abject debate performance and his nomination were closed. Appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d she said that it was up to Biden to \u201cdecide if he is going to run\u201d \u2014 comments that everyone in Washington interpreted as a request for Biden to change his mind. The California Democrat appeared to be offering the president another chance to gracefully change his mind after he warned earlier this week, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d All day, lawmakers sent similar signals. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres \u2014 a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has backed Biden \u2014 told CNN, \u201cIf we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d His fellow New Yorker, moderate Rep. Pat Ryan, called on Biden to live up to his vow to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. \u201cTrump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him. Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump.\u201d And Wednesday evening, Vermont Sen. Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on Biden to withdraw. \u201cHe saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not,\u201d Welch wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. Top Biden campaign officials are set to huddle with Democratic senators Thursday to make the president\u2019s case, but a staffers\u2019 briefing will fall well short of the steps that members are demanding to show that Biden has the strength to beat Trump. As recently as Tuesday evening, it seemed that Biden had succeeded in stalling momentum against him. But within 24 hours, he was fast losing ground and it\u2019s becoming hard to imagine how the party can unite behind him at the Democratic National Convention in August if many lawmakers will leave Chicago and head into an election in which they believe their presidential nominee will seal their defeat. The concerns from lawmakers are so significant because they are listening to voters, reading polling data in their states and concluding Biden not only can\u2019t win but \u2014 as Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said on CNN Tuesday \u2014 could hand Trump a landslide he could use to implement his authoritarian agenda. Top Democratic leaders in Congress have yet to say Biden should leave. And the president still has his defenders. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden ally and campaign co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday: \u201cHe\u2019s going to be our nominee at the convention. He is going to be our candidate in the fall. He is going to be the next president of the United States.\u201d Sen. John Fetterman, who represents the key swing state of Pennsylvania, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that it would be a \u201cdisgrace to discard and push out an amazing president\u201d and said he\u2019d show up to Thursday\u2019s Senate Democratic meeting with brass knuckles to defend Biden. But the rising frustration and indications that the president\u2019s cratering support could end the party\u2019s hopes in November help explain why Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told his members he\u2019d pass on their concerns to Biden. Biden isn\u2019t the \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 of 2010 The most personally stinging defection from Biden came from actor and Democratic mega donor George Clooney, who appeared at a fundraiser with the president only last month. The \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d director and star said he loved Biden, and believed in his morals, character and presidency. But he wrote in a New York Times op-ed, \u201cthe Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010.\u201d Clooney went on: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate. \u2026 We are not going to win in November with this president.\u201d Clooney\u2019s piece underscored how Biden\u2019s plight is not just a boiling political controversy but has become a heart-rending human ordeal for the president, who is loved by many Democrats but whose health and diminished capacities are now becoming fodder for humiliating debate in the most public fashion imaginable. Clooney maintains deep contacts with Democratic office holders and donors, so his views carry more weight than those of just any celebrity. And he\u2019s not the only disgruntled donor. In another danger sign for Biden\u2019s candidacy, one Democratic strategist told CNN, \u201cEverything is frozen because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen. Everyone is in wait and see mode,\u201d adding that money was on the sidelines and awaiting the outcome of Biden\u2019s Thursday news conference and interviews. The president will sit down with NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor\u00a0Lester\u00a0Holt\u00a0for an interview that will tape and air\u00a0next Monday, the network announced. There\u2019s been slippage for Biden since the debate in public polling. And Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who is locked in a tight Senate race in Michigan, told donors on a video call Tuesday that Biden was trailing Trump in private polling in her state, the New York Times reported. If the president cannot carry Michigan, as he did in 2020, his path to the 270 Electoral Votes needed to win the White House becomes negligible. The deepening crisis gripping the Democratic Party is not simply damaging Biden\u2019s chances of clinging to the nomination. It is also offering Trump and Republicans a bottomless source of attack ads against Biden if he\u2019s confirmed as the nominee. Individual candidates can also expect to be skewered over why they are supporting a party figurehead who many Democrats have declared is unfit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. And two weeks of agonizing over Biden\u2019s age and mental faculties, combined with a clumsy mitigation effort by the White House and the campaign, have taken the heat off Trump and deprived Democrats of the comparison with the ex-president\u2019s lawlessness and volatility that many had originally believed would help Biden hold the White House. Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, warned that Democrats needed to end their feuding and get behind the president before it was too late. She told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that it was \u201castonishing\u201d that her party should be on a \u201csuicide mission\u201d so close to the election. But as Biden\u2019s political standing continues to rapidly deteriorate, the question is becoming how much longer he can insist he\u2019s the only Democrat who can beat Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/biden-democrats-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_eyewitnesses-shooting-trump-rally", "text": "Eyewitnesses who spoke to CNN on Saturday described an awful scene following a shooting at former President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which one person was killed and two others injured in what\u2019s being investigated as a possible assassination attempt. A man who spoke before Trump at Saturday\u2019s rally told CNN that he jumped over a barricade to comfort an individual who was bleeding after being shot. Rico Elmore spoke to CNN as he walked away from the rally stage. His white shirt was stained with blood from the victim, whom he said he did not know. Elmore described jumping over the barrier and putting his hand on the head of the attendee who was shot. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired, and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d Elmore told CNN. He said he didn\u2019t know the attendee and he was \u201cjust a stranger.\u201d Elmore was visibly shaken up but said he was not harmed. He said he only saw one attendee hit and did not see what happened to Trump. The former president said on Truth Social on Saturday that he was shot in the ear but his campaign said he was otherwise fine. The Secret Service said hours after the shooting that one rally attendee is dead and two others are critically injured. The gunman shot from outside the rally and was \u201cneutralized\u201d by the Secret Service, spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. A law enforcement source and a police officer at the scene told CNN the shooter was positioned on a building rooftop just outside the rally venue. The source said the building was the same one where CNN had seen a heavy police presence following the shooting. The building would have been to Trump\u2019s right as he spoke. \u2018It was all of a sudden just chaos\u2019 Senate Republican candidate Dave McCormick was sitting in the front row of the event. McCormick told CNN he saw the \u201cimmediate attack on the president\u201d and a person behind him who appeared to be severely injured. McCormick told CNN that Trump had just announced him and invited him up to the stage, when about a minute later he heard \u201ca series of shots \u2013 about seven or eight shots \u2013 just \u2018pop, pop, pop.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt was all of a sudden just chaos. The Secret Service immediately covered the president, jumped on top of him, and the crowd immediately went to the ground,\u201d McCormick said. McCormick said he looked over his shoulder behind him and \u201cit was clear that somebody had been hit.\u201d People around the man were trying to administer first aid, he said, as it took several minutes for medical assistance to get into the crowd because it was so dense. \u201cBut you can imagine with that kind of incident happening, it\u2019s very hard to know what\u2019s coming. \u2026 It seemed like the shots were coming from my front \u2013 so the president\u2019s left \u2013 which makes sense why the person behind me was hit. But I\u2019m not sure if there were also shots coming from the other direction, so as you might imagine it was chaotic and confusing in the moment,\u201d McCormick said. McCormick said he and all of the roughly 15,000 attendees in the crowd went through metal detector screening before they entered the rally. Republican Rep. Dan Meuser told CNN he was sitting in the front row with McCormick and fellow Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly, with the spectator who was fatally shot \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. \u201cIt started out like a regular rally. President Trump came in, took pictures and spent a little bit of time. He came out, he was speaking no longer than six or seven minutes, and next thing you know, there was, there was rapid fire. It was pretty obvious, after the second or third gunshot, what was happening,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if there were others. I mean, when you hear gunfire like that, it sounds like, you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d Meuser added. \u201cA lot of people were very panicked, but fortunately, they settled down after a little while, particularly when President Trump, honestly, stood up and gave a thumbs-up. That kind of calmed the crowd a little bit.\u201d Speaking with CNN, the congressman also made a plea for civility going forward, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to remove the hostility. I think everybody agrees \u2013 we need to cool things down.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s pure insanity\u2019 Joseph Meyn told CNN that a man near him was shot. \u201cVery shocking \u2026 a lot of people just thought it was fireworks going off, I knew immediately\u00a0it was gunfire,\u201d Meyn said. Meyn, a surgeon from Grove City, Pennsylvania, told CNN he helped carry the man out of the bleachers. \u201cI was at the far right of the podium, where the people sit in the front. I was filming him (Trump) speaking on my phone. Just as I was panning back, I heard seven gunshots in rapid successions, in under two or three seconds,\u201d Meyn said. Meyn said he looked back in the direction the gunshots had come from. \u201cI saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head and died instantly. \u2026 There was a woman who was hit in the hand and forearm, a noncritical wound.\u201d He said he went over to see if he could render any aid, but another doctor was already helping the woman who\u2019d been shot. \u201cI helped carry the body of the man out of the stands. They took the body to the tent behind the bleachers,\u201d Meyn added. CNN reached Meyn as he was waiting to give a witness statement to the FBI. \u201cThey want the data off my phone,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first Trump rally I\u2019ve been to. \u2026 You don\u2019t anticipate this stuff to go on, it\u2019s pure insanity.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/eyewitnesses-shooting-trump-rally/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_what-happened-trump-assassination-attempt", "text": "Former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s rally speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening began just as it had at dozens of rallies previously \u2013 his attendees chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and Trump clapped and pointed to faces in the crowd before taking the lectern. About 150 yards to the north of the former president, a gunman was climbing onto the roof of a building\u00a0outside the rally security perimeter. He had an AR-style weapon with him. Six minutes into the former president\u2019s speech, the gunman took aim at Trump and squeezed the trigger. What happened next was as miraculous as it was historic. The gunman, later identified by the FBI as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired multiple shots, including one that Trump said skimmed his ear. Trump ducked to the ground. Five Secret Service agents rushed to the stage and covered the former president, as the pop-pop from another two additional bursts of gunfire rang out across the Butler Farm Show grounds. Forty-three seconds after the first shot was fired, a Secret Service agent said the shooter was down. Trump, his ear and face bloodied, was brought to his feet. He raised his fist in a defiant and iconic pose to his supporters to let them know he was OK before agents took him off the stage and into his SUV. At least three rally attendees were shot, one of whom was killed. The incident is being investigated as an assassination attempt. It is the first time since 1981, when John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan,\u00a0that a current or former president has been shot at. It\u2019s still too soon to determine what security failures may have occurred, such as how the shooter was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump. Attendees have helped to fill in some details, including chaos in the immediate aftermath of the gunfire and suspicions about the gunman before he scaled the roof of the building just outside the rally site \u2013 transforming an ordinary political event into both an extraordinary moment in American politics and a deadly crime scene. \u2018Security seemed tight\u2019 Large crowds had flocked to the show grounds in the small city of Butler, some 30 miles north of Pittsburgh, to glimpse the former president at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention begins\u00a0on Monday. For weeks, the nation had been fixated on Trump\u2019s opponent, and whether President Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0could withstand\u00a0the defections by members of his own party after a poor showing at the CNN presidential debate in June. But by the time Trump arrived in Butler, attention was turning toward\u00a0the convention in Milwaukee. Interest was high in his imminent announcement of a running mate, and he was less than a week from accepting his party\u2019s nomination for president for the third consecutive election cycle. Trump\u2019s fans and voters in Butler \u2013 many of them donning\u00a0the familiar red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats \u2013 were looking forward to hearing from the man himself, braving the mid-July sun to wait for hours on a day with highs around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Two and a half hours before Trump took the stage, the rally attendees watched a typical rally pre-show: There was a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the national anthem, sung by a 16-year-old teenager. Then a raft of the former president\u2019s supporters \u2013 including two congressmen and a Senate candidate \u2013\u00a0spoke to warm up the crowd ahead of the rally headliner. \u201cHe was very upbeat and excited about the rally because it was such a great turnout,\u201d said Dave McCormick, the Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania who saw Trump\u00a0before the shooting. McCormick was whisked\u00a0into the venue through a private entrance manned by members of the Secret Service. There, someone waved a security wand around him to ensure he was not carrying a weapon. \u201cSecurity,\u201d\u00a0he said Sunday, \u201cseemed tight.\u201d Other attendees had to go through magnetometers, or walk-through metal detectors, to get into the rally. It was there that one person caught the attention of authorities: Crooks was spotted by local law enforcement, who thought he\u00a0was\u00a0acting suspiciously near the magnetometers, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to the Secret Service as well, according to the source. Indeed, a local officer\u00a0spotted Crooks before he began shooting\u00a0but could not engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told CNN. The officer was searching the area after Butler Township officers received calls about a suspicious person outside the rally perimeter, Slupe said. Officers eventually discovered Crook was on the roof, and one local officer hoisted another up to peer over the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer and pointed his gun at him, Slupe said. The officer let go to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. \u2018This is a big, big, beautiful crowd\u2019 Trump was initially scheduled to go on stage about 5 p.m.\u00a0ET, but he was running late. It wasn\u2019t until 6:02 p.m.\u00a0that Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d began blaring on the venue\u2019s speakers and the former president walked up the short staircase on the left side of the makeshift rally stage. Trump was wearing a white shirt without a tie, a dark navy suit and his signature red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d hat. As Greenwood\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American\u201d chorus played in the background, Trump circled the stage, clapping to the audience and pointing at various attendees seated both in front of him as well as in the grandstands behind him. Trump\u2019s supporters waved \u201cTrump 2024\u201d signs that read \u201cCrooked Joe You\u2019re Fired!\u201d on the back. At 6:05 p.m., the song finished and Trump took to the lectern at the center of the stage. \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d the attendees chanted. \u201cThis is a big crowd\u00a0\u2014 this is a big, big, beautiful crowd,\u201d Trump said at the start of his speech. As he did at every rally, Trump quickly began\u00a0by\u00a0criticizing Biden, warning about immigrants coming across US borders, and vowing to win Pennsylvania and \u201ctake back our country.\u201d He noted McCormick, the GOP Pennsylvania Senate candidate, seated in front of him. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get a good senator,\u201d Trump told the crowd, pointing to McCormick and saying he would bring him up on stage a little bit\u00a0later. Trump continued with his speech. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I go off teleprompter, do you?\u201d he asked the crowd to cheers at 6:10 p.m., exactly 60 seconds before the shots began. The former president turned his attention to a chart with border statistics displayed on a massive screen over his right shoulder offstage. \u201cTake a look at that chart,\u201d Trump said and pointed to his right \u2013 turning in the direction of the building north of him, where Crooks was preparing to take aim at the former president. Crooks had climbed onto\u00a0the flat rooftop of a light beige, single-story commercial building roughly 150 yards to the north of the rally stage. The open grass area where the rally was being held was encircled with a low chain-link fence. The building was just outside that fenced perimeter. An eyewitness described\u00a0being\u00a0on a fence line and seeing a gunman moving \u201cfrom roof to roof\u201d just before the shooting. There were several buildings in the complex. The witness, Ben Macer, told\u00a0CNN affiliate KDKA\u00a0that he went to tell an officer just moments before the shooting began. \u201cWhen I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that,\u201d Macer said. \u2018Get down, get down, get down!\u2019 At 6:11 p.m., Trump was six minutes into his speech, looking to his right and looking at the jumbotron displaying immigration statistics.\u00a0\u201cYou know that\u2019s a little bit old \u2014\u00a0that chart, that chart\u2019s a couple of months old,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd if you want to really see something this sad,\u201d Trump continued, \u201ctake a look at what happened\u2026\u201d \u201cPop pop. Pop pop. Pop pop.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t finish his sentence. The sounds of several rounds of gunfire rang out across the rally site. Trump grabbed his ear and took a step backward before ducking to the ground. \u201cGet down! Get down! Get down!\u201d a male agent yelled at the former president. Five agents swarmed the stage and surrounded Trump on the floor. \u201cPop, pop, pop, pop.\u201d\u00a0 There was another round of gunshots, this time in staccato-like succession, five seconds after the first. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing, what\u2019re we doing?\u201d a female agent said, in audio that was picked up by Trump\u2019s microphone. Twelve seconds later, a third round of gunshots echoed through the show grounds. \u201cReady.\u201d \u201cMove!\u201d \u201cUp!\u201d \u201cGo, go, go.\u201d Several agents shouted short commands in succession while they remained on top of Trump. Agents in combat gear with long rifles walked onto the stage. Forty-three seconds after the first shots were fired, the agents said the shooter was down. \u201cShooter\u2019s down. Shooter\u2019s down. Are we good to move?\u201d several agents said. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d asked a female agent. \u201cWe\u2019re clear, we\u2019re clear, we\u2019re clear,\u201d agents said. \u201cLet\u2019s move, let\u2019s move,\u201d said a male agent. \u2018Wait, wait, wait\u2019 Trump was then lifted to his feet by the agents around him. \u201cLet me get my shoes on,\u201d Trump said once he was standing. \u201cHold on, your head is bloody,\u201d one of the agents told him. \u201cSir, we\u2019ve got to move to the car, sir,\u201d another agent said. \u201cLet me get my shoes,\u201d Trump said again. The agents prepared to move Trump offstage when he stopped them once more. \u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d the former president told them. Trump lifted his head above the agents surrounding him and raised his fist in the air. \u201cFight!\u201d Trump mouthed to the crowd three times, sparking loud cheers from attendees as they rose to their feet upon seeing that Trump was OK. Trump and\u00a0the\u00a0five agents surrounding him\u00a0walked in unison to the stairs at the left of the stage. Trump stopped once more to raise his fist, pumping it three times before he was carried down the stairs and into his SUV several feet away. Trump raised his fist one last time as he got into the backseat of the vehicle. \u2018It was all of a sudden just chaos\u2019 As the first gunshots echoed across the show grounds, rallygoers cried out. Members of the crowd in the bleachers behind Trump ducked, mirroring the former president, their faces a mix of confusion and fear. When one final gunshot rang out, a loud scream pierced the air. \u201cIt was all of a sudden just chaos,\u201d said McCormick, an Army combat veteran, describing the moment the Secret Service converged on the former president, shielding Trump with their own bodies. Behind him, people were gathered around \u00a0a victim, trying to administer first aid until medical assistance could make its way through the dense crowd. Adding to the chaos and confusion, a tractor parked on the other side of the stage let out a massive cloud of steam, apparently having been hit by a stray bullet. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from nearby Grove City, was filming Trump\u2019s speech on his phone \u2014 it was his first Trump rally, he said \u2014 when he heard the gunshots and saw the former president get hit. He said that when he looked to see where the gunshots originated, he saw a man who had been shot in the head. Meyn was sure the sound was gunfire, but many other attendees thought they were hearing fireworks. \u201cHalf the crowd was in shock, and the other half thought it was some type of weird joke,\u201d Meyn said. Rico Elmore,\u00a0a former Pennsylvania legislative candidate\u00a0who had spoken at the rally earlier, vaulted over a barrier to reach a wounded attendee, he later told CNN. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired, and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d he said, visibly shaken, his own white button-down shirt by that time stained with blood. Elmore didn\u2019t know the man. \u201cJust a stranger,\u201d he said. Meyn said he \u201chelped carry the body of the man out of the stands.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers,\u201d he said later, while waiting to provide a witness statement to the FBI. Investigators wanted access to data on his phone, he said. One rally attendee was killed by the shots, and another two were critically injured, law enforcement\u00a0said\u00a0later that evening. The victim was identified on Sunday as Corey Comperatore. Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Comperatore was an \u201cavid supporter of the former president\u201d and was excited to be there with him in the community. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Cory loved his community. Most especially, Cory loved his family,\u201d Shapiro said. \u2018I was shot with a bullet\u2019 Trump was taken to a local hospital from the rally site, with the world watching on to learn whether he had been seriously hurt. Thirty minutes after he was shot, the Secret Service communications chief posted on X that Trump was \u201csafe,\u201d and that the incident was under investigation. Soon after, Trump\u2019s spokesman released a statement that the former president was \u201cfine\u201d and being checked out at a local medical facility. As he so often does, Trump would fill in more details about what happened through his own social media. \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social at 8:42 p.m., thanking law enforcement for their quick response and expressing condolences for the attendee\u00a0who was killed. Biden was attending church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when the shooting occurred. After leaving church, the president was briefed on the\u00a0attack on his predecessor. Biden then made an unscheduled stop at\u00a0the local Rehoboth police department, where he denounced the \u201csick\u201d shooting and said there was \u201cno place in America for this kind of violence.\u201d \u201cI have tried to get ahold of Donald,\u201d Biden said.\u202f\u201cHe\u2019s with his doctors.\u202f\u00a0They \u2014 apparently, he\u2019s doing well.\u202fI plan on talking to him shortly, I hope, when I get back to the telephone.\u201d Biden and Trump did speak by phone later that evening.\u00a0\u202fA source briefed on the call said it was \u201cgood\u201d and\u202f\u201cshort and respectful.\u201d Before Saturday\u2019s call, the two men hadn\u2019t spoken to each other directly in years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/what-happened-trump-assassination-attempt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this.

Blood could be seen on his face as he was carried away by Secret Service. Get live updates on the breaking news. Multiple presidents and former presidents and candidates for president have been attacked in US history, according to a CNN report from 2011 and a list of instances of political violence that includes attacks on senators, congressmen and governors compiled by CNN\u2019s research library. Multiple presidents, former presidents or candidates have survived assassination attempts In the pre-Civil War era, President Andrew Jackson was shot at while attending a funeral in the Capitol. The shooter fired twice, but the gun failed. Former President Theodore Roosevelt, like Trump, was trying to get his old job back during the 1912 campaign. He was shot on the way to a speech in Milwaukee by a saloon keeper. Roosevelt later said a folded-up copy of his 50-page speech slowed the bullet, which stayed in his body for the rest of his life. He gave the speech despite the shooting. Franklin D. Roosevelt was president-elect when a would-be assassin fired at him in Miami in 1933. The shooter, Guiseppe Zangara, missed Roosevelt but killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. He was put to death by electrocution. Harry Truman, who took over the presidency after Roosevelt died, was shot at across from the White House by Puerto Rican nationalists in 1950. Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a segregationist who was running for president for the third time in 1972, was shot after a campaign event outside Washington, DC. The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down, and he later rethought his politics. Gerald Ford faced two assassination attempts in quick succession in 1975. Lynette \u201cSqeaky\u201d Fromme, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, was foiled before she could fire at Ford in Sacramento, California. Weeks later, a woman named Sara Jane Moore shot at Ford in San Francisco but missed because a bystander grabbed her. Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton in Washington, DC, after giving a speech. His press secretary, James Brady, was more seriously wounded than Reagan and later became an activist for gun control. Reagan\u2019s shooter, John Hinckley, spent decades in a mental institution. He was released from court supervision in 2022. All presidents face threats and all former presidents also get lifetime Secret Service protection. An Idaho man was charged with the attempted assassination of Barack Obama when he fired shots at the White House in 2011. A man was charged with trying to assassinate then-President Bill Clinton in 1994 after shooting at the White House, and a plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush in Kuwait was foiled in 1993, after he left office. His son, then-President George W. Bush, faced a failed assassination attempt by a man with a grenade while visiting the country Georgia in 2005. Four US presidents\u00a0who\u00a0were assassinated\u00a0were all\u00a0shot Abraham Lincoln was the first president to die by assassination. He was shot in the back of the head in 1865 during an appearance at Ford\u2019s Theater in Washington, DC, by John Wilkes Booth, an actor in the play that night and Southern sympathizer. Booth fled the scene and was shot when he was captured weeks later in Virginia. James Garfield was shot at a train station in Washington, DC, in July 1881. He died from his wounds months later, in September, in New Jersey. Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau, a disaffected former supporter with mental illness who was angry at not getting a job in Garfield\u2019s administration. Guiteau was convicted and hanged within the year. William McKinley was shot in September 1901 in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. McKinley was making an appearance at the Pan-American Exposition. He lingered for days in Buffalo before dying from his wounds. Czolgosz was later electrocuted. John F. Kennedy was killed by a sniper, Lee Harvey Oswald, in Dallas in November 1963 as he was driven down a parade route in an open-topped limousine. Oswald, a Soviet sympathizer, was arrested shortly after the assassination. Oswald was himself killed by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas police station. JFK\u2019s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, was a senator from New York when he was running for president in 1968. RFK was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles the night he won the California Democratic primary. His killer, Sirhan Sirhan, is still in jail in California and recently had a parole request denied. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an independent candidate for president this year.

He had a gun,\u201d Mike DiFrischia said of the shooter. \u201cAnd then when he said that, I moved over a couple of feet, and I was able to get a perfect, I was able to see him perfectly,\u201d he continued. Then he began to record. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement \u2014 was trying to tell them, you know, where he was, but they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building. So it just got very hectic, very fast,\u201d DiFrischia said. Law enforcement officials asked the DiFrischias, \u201cWhere\u2019s he at?\u201d and they pointed toward the shooter\u2019s location, they told Burnett. Shortly after attempting to alert authorities to the shooter\u2019s position, Amber DiFrischia said people began to run. And then they began to hear gunshots. \u201cIt was just chaotic. It was so fast. First thing is, find coverage. And it was just the scariest thing, you know, there\u2019s not a lot of places you can hide there,\u201d she said, adding they tried \u201cto hide behind two trees just to make sure we weren\u2019t going to be, you know, hit by the bullets.\u201d Mike DiFrischia described how he watched one officer try to climb the building but not make it to the shooter\u2019s location, explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t know if the guy startled him, or what exactly happened.\u201d Though the DiFrischias could not immediately identify that officer, CNN has reported a local officer saw the gunman and was hoisted by another to get up to the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop. Trump, who says he was shot in the ear, was rushed offstage with blood on his face. As CNN has reported, widespread concerns and questions have surfaced about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president\u2019s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Sources have described the shooting as coming from the \u201cthree o\u2019clock\u201d position of Trump\u2019s\u00a0podium location,\u00a0with shots coming from his right side.\u00a0Seconds after gunfire rang out, Secret Service counter-assault snipers began shooting the suspect, who was found deceased on top of the roof. Mike DiFrischia, who said his recording also captured the gunman lifeless atop the building, recounted how he first thought the shooter was facing the crowd and had told people around him to get down. \u201cWhen I first seen him looking our way, I thought that he was actually, you know, maybe gonna start shooting this way. I did not realize he had already been shot,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_bob-menendez-jury-corruption-trial", "text": "The jury in the federal corruption trial against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his co-defendants began deliberations Friday after hearing from 37 witnesses over nine weeks of testimony. Jurors were dismissed for the day after deliberating for approximately\u00a0three hours Friday and are expected to return to Manhattan criminal court at 9:30 a.m. ET on Monday to continue their deliberations. Menendez and his co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of participating in a yearslong bribery scheme. Prosecutors say the senator tried to use his power to advance Egyptian military interests, interfere in criminal prosecutions and secure investment from Qatari officials, among other things. Menendez and his wife allegedly received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a Mercedes Benz convertible and other bribes in exchange for his influence. The senator\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but will be tried separately later this year after she was granted a delay by the judge so she can focus on her treatment for breast cancer.\u00a0She has pleaded not guilty. Bob Menendez faces 16 counts \u2013 including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent \u2013 for his alleged role in the scheme. The senator has denied any wrongdoing and accused prosecutors of targeting him. He did not take the stand in his own defense during the trial. Prosecutors spent nearly seven weeks untangling the multiple corruption schemes that they allege Bob and Nadine Menendez and the co-defendants were involved in. Federal prosecutors structured their case by chapters, calling witnesses to testify about separate schemes allegedly brokered by the senator in tandem with his wife. According to evidence presented by prosecutors in court, the schemes involved Hana, Daibes and another co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, the New Jersey businessman who allegedly bribed the senator in exchange for legal favors. Uribe struck a plea deal ahead of the trial. Bob Menendez\u2019s attorneys consistently suggested in cross-examinations that the senator was not aware of the deals his wife struck with the co-defendants, which included offering the senator\u2019s influence for a price. Prosecutors alleged that Nadine Menendez was an intermediary for communications between the co-conspirators and her willing husband. During the trial, the senator\u2019s lawyers called five witnesses, including his sister, sister-in-law and the attorney for a friend of Uribe. A Menendez lawyer said the senator customarily stored cash due to familial trauma caused by the Cuban communist regime. (Menendez was born in New York City, and Fidel Castro had not yet come to power at the time his family left Cuba). In his closing argument, Menendez\u2019s defense attorney said the lack of evidence in the case against the senator made it \u201cshaky and rotten to its core.\u201d The trial has been largely overshadowed, first by former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in a nearby Manhattan criminal court at the end of May and then by the drama surrounding Joe Biden\u2019s political fate. But a verdict in Menendez\u2019s case could have broader consequences \u2013 potentially imperiling Democrats\u2019 narrow Senate majority and throwing New Jersey politics into a new round of disarray. Menendez, who is up for reelection in November, did not run in the Democratic primary this spring. Rep. Andy Kim, of South Jersey, is now the Democratic nominee, but Menendez has floated an independent bid to keep his seat \u2013 if he is acquitted. That could lead to a messy, three-way race in which Kim and Menendez could split the Democratic vote, opening a path for Republican nominee Curtis Bashaw \u2013 a scenario Senate Democrats are desperate to avoid given the many challenges they face in defending their narrow majority.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Instead, the 44-year-old Atlanta cardiologist saw a candidate she hardly recognized. She turned the event off halfway through, feeling sad and concerned the president had suffered a medical event like a stroke. That disappointment, however, hasn\u2019t dissuaded her from her plan to vote for the president. She finds the alternative \u2013 a second Trump term \u2013 untenable. \u201cDon\u2019t rock the boat unless you have a plan to get me back to shore,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting me to shore is making sure that Donald Trump is not in office come January 2025.\u201d Four years ago, Black voters saved Biden\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination after his poor finishes in predominantly White early voting states. Now, that support within the Black community \u2013 from battleground state voters and Black leaders \u2013 serves as one of the last bulwarks against a growing number of lawmakers and donors asking him to pass the torch. That support is seen in Georgia, which was crucial to the president\u2019s past political success.\u00a0Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992, when he defeated Trump by less than 12,000 votes. But repeating that victory will be a challenge. In a new memo to Democrats this week, the Biden campaign argued that its \u201cclearest path\u201d to winning in November runs through the so-called Blue Wall states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, suggesting that Georgia \u2013 as well as other battlegrounds like Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina \u2013 aren\u2019t as competitive. Any path to victory for Biden in the Peach State this year will depend on the continued support of Black voters, many of whom said they would prefer to keep him, even over the opportunity to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris as the party\u2019s first Black woman nominee. In interviews, the president\u2019s supporters in the state shared a similar message: the stakes of this election are too high to change course now. \u201cI am voting for democracy, and as of right now a convicted felon is not it,\u201d Jarita Burdette, a 42-year-old Atlanta resident, told CNN. \u201cBiden\u2019s our guy, that\u2019s who I\u2019m riding with.\u201d Some voters said they thought Biden was capable of leading for another four years and preferred him over a hypothetical alternative. Many expressed frustration with the attention being paid to Biden\u2019s age and performance vs. Trump\u2019s record and policies. \u201cThe Democratic Party knew four years ago how old Joe Biden would be in 2024,\u201d said Michelle Mitchell, a 69-year-old Black Atlanta resident who participated in a CNN roundtable with older voters and opposes efforts to pressure Biden to step aside. \u201cTo try to pull a stunt like this at the 11th hour is very disappointing.\u201d Jayla Koriyan, a 26-year-old Atlanta voter, said her vote in November is aimed at keeping Trump out of office. She pointed to the former president\u2019s plans to launch a massive deportation operation of migrants and criticized him for his unwillingness over the years to denounce the far-right Proud Boys or the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Asked if she had concerns about Biden\u2019s age, Koriyan replied: \u201cWhat are our other options?\u201d History of support Multiple post-debate polls have shown that Black voters are split on whether the president should step aside or remain at the top of the Democratic ticket. A Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll released this week found 47% of Black voters said Biden should continue his campaign, compared to 49% who said he should cede the nomination to someone else. A New York Times/Siena College poll found a similar split. But the same polls suggest that the calls for Biden to cede the nomination aren\u2019t as strong within the Black community. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that among Biden supporters, 58% of Black supporters said both Biden and Trump ought to be replaced, compared with 84% of Asian supporters, 74% of White supporters and 67% of Hispanic supporters. Support among Black voters has long been the make or break point for Democratic politicians. In 2008, Black voters helped Barack Obama win the Democratic nomination and their high voter turnout helped him carry states like Ohio and North Carolina. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination thanks in large part to Black primary voters in South Carolina and other southern states. And in 2020, Biden seemed poised for primary defeat after he placed fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. It was his first place finish in South Carolina, fresh off the endorsement of Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, that turned the primary around. Biden won 61% of the Black vote, which made up 56% of the Democratic primary electorate, according to CNN exit polling. As of Friday, more than a dozen members of Congress have called on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation. But the president\u2019s support among the Congressional Black Caucus has remained strong publicly. Clyburn said Friday that he\u2019s \u201call in\u201d on Biden, and that discussions about whether the president should drop out should end. \u201cThe conversation should focus on the record of this administration, on the alternative to his election, and let Joe Biden make his own decisions about his political future,\u201d Clyburn told NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Today Show.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s earned that right.\u201d What\u2019s the alternative? Rhonda Briggins, a 51-year-old political organizer based in Atlanta, said her main focus is defeating Trump and boosting down ballot Democratic candidates. Everything else, including calls for Biden to step aside, is a distraction. But part of her reasoning for keeping Biden is borne out of a fear for Harris and her safety. Briggins said Harris is \u201cmore than qualified\u201d to become president, but the thought of the vice president becoming the nominee made her nervous. \u201cSexism in America is more prevalent than even racism in America, and so to be a Black woman you get both hits,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of so many things when we even think about that as an option for her.\u201d Among the names floated in the media to replace Biden if he steps aside \u2013 California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them \u2013 the most logical choice for many Biden skeptics has been Harris, who could inherit much of the campaign\u2019s funding and infrastructure and run on his record. Morris said that Harris would be an \u201cobvious choice,\u201d and she would vote for her if she were the nominee. Her concern, she said, was that independents wouldn\u2019t. \u201cWe saw this with Stacey Abrams here in the state of Georgia, where you had a highly competent nominee who had all the credentials,\u201d Morris said, referring to the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in both 2018 and 2022. \u201cShe had everything. She was the full package. And she did not win.\u201d Some voters said they would be open to Harris and think she can do the job. But a few said they hadn\u2019t seen enough of her over the last four years to feel confident swapping her in. Robyn Gipson, a 29-year-old Atlanta voter who wants Biden to stay in, said she didn\u2019t have confidence Harris could beat Trump because she hasn\u2019t heard enough from her over the last few years. \u201cI feel as though Kamala, the only thing I know her for is \u2018We did it Joe,\u2019\u201d Gipson said, referencing the viral moment when Harris called Biden to congratulate him on their 2020 victory. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years, we haven\u2019t seen anything.\u201d George Mitchell, a 78-year-old Atlanta resident who also participated in the roundtable discussion, said he would back Harris. Anyone, in his view, would be better than Trump. \u201cI would support my third-grade nephew,\u201d he said. \u201cI will support anyone that the Democrats put up there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/black-voters-georgia-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_joe-biden-trump-campaign", "text": "President Joe Biden and his campaign are facing an abrupt pivot point: After spending the last two weeks trying to salvage the president\u2019s reelection bid, they are now grappling with a delicate national moment following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign and Democrats across the party scrambled Sunday to determine how to adjust their plans to counter messaging at the Republican National Convention, which had been in the works for some time. \u201cThe big issue is how to campaign against him or attack him,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN. \u201cCan we even do that this week?\u201d The adviser said discussions were underway to calibrate jabs and criticism aimed at Trump to focus on policy differences, rather than personal attacks. Plans that had been underway for weeks to respond to the GOP convention are being reviewed and potentially adjusted. In the hours following the attempted assassination, which killed one spectator and injured two others, both Biden and Trump called for unity. In a rare Oval Office address Sunday night, Biden called on the country to \u201clower the temperature in our politics.\u201d \u201cWhile we disagree,\u201d Biden said, \u201cwe are not enemies. We\u2019re neighbors.\u201d Hours before the shooting at the Trump rally, Biden had been trying to assuage concerns among members of his own party by participating in calls with key groups of lawmakers \u2013 some of whom were still unconvinced about his viability as a candidate. But the campaign\u2019s focus took a sudden turn as news of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, took hold. Stunned Biden campaign officials huddled\u00a0and decided to pause all outbound\u00a0communications and pull\u00a0down TV\u00a0ads. The campaign urged\u00a0staff in a memo to\u00a0\u201crefrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public.\u201d Sources described the mood within the White House and the Biden campaign as \u201cshock\u201d as they put their response into motion. The president was attending mass in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware \u2013 where he has a residence \u2013 at the time the shots rang out. He briefly addressed the nation hours after \u2013 a choice he made shortly after being briefed on the incident, according to a source familiar with the matter. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this,\u201d he said. Biden then returned to the White House late Saturday, ditching plans to remain in Rehoboth for the weekend. The Biden campaign has yet to decide when to resume its advertising campaign against Trump after pulling the ads on Saturday. But that, a separate Democratic strategist said, was the easy decision. A harder question is how and when to resume, with 114 days until the election. Chief among the difficulties for the Biden camp will be recalibrating a message that\u2019s appropriate for the moment after a month when the team directed more forceful rhetoric against Biden\u2019s predecessor, especially on his criminal conviction. Sen. Chris\u00a0Coons, a close Biden ally and co-chair of the Biden reelection campaign, called for a lowering of the political temperature. \u201cWe have to reduce the rhetoric and the tone. I\u2019d urge folks to turn off their phones and get off of social media today. And take some time with your family and reflect on who we are as a nation and who we want to be,\u201d the Delaware senator said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The president briefly addressed reporters Sunday afternoon, his second time appearing in front of cameras since the shooting, and announced he would be speaking a third time later in the evening from the Oval Office. The president urged people not to make assumptions and to \u201clet the FBI do their job,\u201d stressing that the shooter\u2019s motivations were still being investigated. He emphasized that Trump \u201calready received a heightened level of security\u201d in his capacity as both a former president and the presumptive Republican Party nominee, and noted that he has \u201cbeen consistent in my direction to the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety.\u201d Biden added that he has ordered the Secret Service to review its plans for the Republican National Convention that begins on Monday. He\u2019s also ordered an independent review of the security at Saturday\u2019s rally to discover how the attempted assassination was able to take place. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter. An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation,\u201d Biden said, sending his condolences to the family of the man who was killed at the rally and his well wishes to Trump. \u201cUnity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is important as that right now. We\u2019ll debate and we\u2019ll disagree. That\u2019s not going to change. But it\u2019s going \u2013 we\u2019re not going to lose sight of the fact who we are as Americans.\u201d In the Oval Office later Sunday, Biden reiterated his belief that the stakes in the upcoming election \u201care incredibly high.\u201d But the president added: \u201cPolitics must never be a literal battlefield, and God forbid, a killing field.\u201d The attempted assassination of Biden\u2019s opponent also challenges two central\u00a0goals\u00a0of his presidency and candidacy:\u00a0To heal a politically fraught nation and to restore faith in America\u2019s democracy. Around the world,\u00a0condemnation of the shooting came from Canada to China to the Kremlin, as allies and adversaries alike watched the US\u2019 deep divisions on display. Biden has pitched the race as the decision between the continuation and possible destruction of democracy in the United States. That rhetoric will now be closely examined in the aftermath of the attack, including comments that the president made in a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. While public calls for Biden to step aside following his poor debate performance two weeks ago have cooled in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the concerns voiced directly to the president in calls on Saturday have hardly gone away. A White House official said Sunday the president would continue his outreach to lawmakers and supporters but would turn his immediate focus to his presidential duties of directing the government\u2019s response to the first assassination attempt of a former president or presidential candidate in more than four decades. Over the course of Sunday morning, the president and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by senior homeland security and local law enforcement officials, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. As Biden\u2019s top advisers briefed him in the Situation Room on the shooting, the president\u2019s political team was grappling with whether planned travel to Nevada should proceed, according to an official. The White House announced Biden was postponing a planned trip to Texas on Monday. Biden is also set to be interviewed by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt for a primetime special airing Monday evening. Harris has already postponed a planned trip to Florida in response to the assassination attempt, according to a Biden-Harris campaign official. She originally planned on traveling to Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday for a moderated conversation alongside Republican women to discuss Trump\u2019s stance on women\u2019s reproductive rights. After being briefed on the incident on Saturday, the vice president denounced the \u201csenseless\u201d shooting and said she is relieved Trump was not seriously injured.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_judge-dismisses-giuliani-bankruptcy-case", "text": "Rudy Giuliani\u00a0is no longer entitled to\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0protection, a judge decided Friday, making it possible\u00a0for creditors to immediately pursue his assets\u00a0within days. The former mayor of New York sought bankruptcy protection\u00a0after a jury awarded two Georgia election workers $148 million because Giuliani defamed them after the 2020 election. The judge\u2019s decision Friday, to end his bankruptcy, paves the way for\u00a0Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss,\u00a0as well as other creditors, who are trying to collect on the more than $150 million Giuliani owes. Judge Sean Lane of the federal bankruptcy court in New York made the decision partly because of Giuliani\u2019s lack of transparency after he filed for bankruptcy more than six months ago. Lane highlighted in his 22-page opinion that Giuliani hadn\u2019t provided any insight whatsoever into the books of companies he solely owns, and that have taken in thousands of dollars in wire transfers in recent weeks. The judge also said Giuliani hasn\u2019t been fully transparent with his creditors \u2013 such as by not fully explaining on time an upcoming book contract he has, or keeping his personal earnings from a radio show and podcast coming into one of the corporate accounts. \u201cMr. Giuliani has failed to provide an accurate and complete picture of his financial affairs in the six months that this case has been pending,\u201d Lane wrote in his decision Friday. \u201cThe lack of financial transparency is particularly troubling given concerns that Mr. Giuliani has engaged in self-dealing and that he has potential conflicts of interest that would hamper the administration of his bankruptcy case.\u201d Giuliani \u2013 once Time magazine\u2019s Person of the Year and a fixture in New York society \u2013\u00a0says he is now worth about $10.6 million, with nearly all of that wealth in the value of\u00a0two apartments he owns, in New York City and in Palm Beach, Florida. Moss and Freeman plan to seek liens on\u00a0those properties in the coming days, according to their lawyers. In a statement provided by a spokesman, Giuliani cast himself Friday as a man being punished for his role in politics in recent years. \u201cWe will continue to pursue justice and we are confident that\u2014in the long run\u2014our system of justice will be restored and the mayor will be totally vindicated,\u201d Giuliani\u2019s spokesman Ted Goodman said in the statement. Giuliani\u2019s attorneys have indicated he plans to appeal the defamation jury verdict in favor of Moss and Freeman and that he may\u00a0fight them in state court on any liens they seek. In addition to the $6 million, three-bedroom co-op apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the $3.5 million condo on the Intracoastal Waterway in Florida, Giuliani\u2019s creditors will also be able to try to seize his bank accounts, a Mercedes-Benz sports car, his collection of 26 luxury watches, three World Series championship rings for the New York Yankees, and other baseball memorabilia, like a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt he claims to own. The worth of those other assets\u00a0is unclear, as creditors accuse\u00a0Giuliani of\u00a0downplaying or not disclosing complete estimates of the value of\u00a0what he owns. The creditors believe one World Series ring alone would sell for nearly $30,000, according to court filings in his bankruptcy case. Giuliani also says in bankruptcy filings that the state of California owes him\u00a0more than $10,000 related to\u00a0overpaid taxes from\u00a0his appearance on the TV singing game show \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d according to bankruptcy filings. Giuliani also said in filings in recent weeks that he expects to be paid\u00a0tens of thousands of dollars from various ventures: coffee beans being marketed\u00a0with his name and image, and a documentary that\u2019s been in the works for years. The court decision on Friday, announced by Lane in White Plains, New York, marks a long, slow decline for Giuliani, largely related to his work as a lawyer for\u00a0former President Donald Trump after the 2020 election. Giuliani lost his law license in New York last week because he had pushed false information in court challenging the election results on behalf of\u00a0Trump. He is also fighting criminal charges in Arizona and Georgia related to Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine his electoral loss. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty in both cases. Giuliani agreed to end his bankruptcy proceedings, after Freeman and Moss suggested that approach earlier this week. They and other creditors had become furious with the lack of transparency he provided into his assets. The creditors\u00a0argued to the judge in recent days that Giuliani was exploiting the bankruptcy system to avoid having to pay\u00a0his debts, and was acting in bad faith. That accusation prompted outbursts from Giuliani in court, claiming he was the one being defamed. In addition to Moss and Freeman, Giuliani owes more $1 million in taxes, tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid phone bills, and more than $1 million to a law firm where a close friend represented him through past investigations. Several other companies and people, such as a former assistant and the voting machine companies Smartmatic and Dominion, are suing him too. This story has been updated with additional developments.

Speaking from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, about two hours after the shooting, Biden said, \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sick,\u201d the president added. With the apparent shooting threatening to further inflame political rhetoric in the months ahead of November, Biden took the opportunity to call for the country to unite. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this,\u201d he said. Biden and Trump spoke late Saturday night, a White House official said. The shooting \u2013 which is being investigated as an attempted assassination, according to law enforcement officials \u2013 left Trump bleeding from the ear. A spokesperson said the former president was doing \u201cfine\u201d and being treated at a medical facility. The suspected shooter and at least one rally attendee were killed, Butler County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. Biden was attending mass at St. Edmond\u2019s Catholic\u00a0Church in Rehoboth Beach when the shooting occurred. The president is due to return to the White House late Saturday night, cutting short his planned weekend in Delaware. He\u2019ll receive an updated briefing from homeland security and law enforcement officials on Sunday, the White House official said.  The shooting marks a massive turning point not only for the country, but for Biden\u2019s role as president: he entered the church as a president fighting for his political future and exited in a familiar role - the nation\u2019s counsellor in chief now tasked with bringing the United States together during a serious crisis. The shooting at Trump\u2019s rally is a shocking turn in what has been a highly charged political season for both of the major-party candidates. Biden has pitched the race as the decision between the continuation and possible destruction of democracy in the United States.

There\u2019s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.\u201d Inside Biden campaign\u2019s response Moments after the incident, Biden campaign officials huddled and decided to pull down all TV ads and limit their public campaign messaging. Bidens campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez and chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon sent a note to campaign staff Saturday evening in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, urging staff to \u201crefrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re also asking everyone to pause any proactive campaign communication across all platforms and in all circumstances until we know more,\u201d they wrote in a note, which was obtained by CNN. Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez and O\u2019Malley Dillon began the note by saying that as more information comes in, they are \u201cgrateful to the members of law enforcement who immediately jumped into action and wishing Trump a quick and full recovery.\u201d Mood inside the White House is \u2018shock\u2019 The mood inside the White House is \u201cshock\u201d as officials responded to the shooting, according to a senior administration official, and who added that officials wanted \u201cto be responsive and serious.\u201d Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, sent a brief note to White House staff Saturday evening, saying that the president was \u201cclosely\u201d tracking the situation and would continue to provide updates, according to the note obtained by CNN. Biden told his staff that he wanted to address the nation as soon as he was briefed, according to a source familiar with the matter. \u201cIt is just really horrible,\u201d the senior administration official said, responding to how the reaction has been within the White House following the incident. \u201cIt should never happen.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_trump-shooting-politics-analysis", "text": "The attempted assassination of Donald Trump, which opens a dark new chapter in America\u2019s cursed story of political violence, shook a nation already deeply estranged during one of the most tense periods of its modern history. The targeting of a former president at a campaign rally just days before he accepts the Republican nomination is, by definition, an attack on democracy and the right of each American to choose their leaders. The presumptive GOP nominee was on stage, with supporters as usual behind him in bleachers holding up posters and wearing their MAGA regalia, when shots rang out. He flinched, then grabbed the side of his face and disappeared behind his podium as people started to scream and the surreal nature of what was happening began to dawn. The ex-president later said that he felt a bullet rip through the skin of his ear, which poured with blood as he was rushed from the scene. The shots fired by a gunman on a roof outside the perimeter of his rally at Butler, Pennsylvania, came a fraction of an inch from being a lot worse. A photograph by Evan Vucci of the Associated Press of a defiant but alive Trump \u2013 with blood on his ear and cheek, being rushed off stage by Secret Service agents, fist raised with an American flag in the background \u2013 became instantly iconic. The image will define a fraught political age, whatever the so-far unknowable political aftermath of a sunny afternoon that turned into a nightmare. Horrific associations The pop, pop, pop of gunfire and the sight of a political leader tumbling to the ground \u2013 with Secret Service agents rushing to throw themselves on top of him to shield him \u2013 awoke grave historic traumas. While Trump is not currently serving as president, his wounding underscores the ever-present threat that always hangs over the office and those who run for it \u2013 and especially for those who claim it. President Joe Biden is the 46th president \u2013 and four of his predecessors have been killed while in office, most recently John F. Kennedy in 1963.\u00a0The fact that Trump was attacked ends a 40-year-period in which many have assumed that the Secret Service\u2019s expertise had greatly reduced the potential for such outrages \u2013 and will cast a pall that will last for years. Trump\u2019s targeting during a presidential campaign drew comparisons to the assassination of Democratic candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, a blood-soaked year that also saw the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which will host the same event this year. But political violence hasn\u2019t stopped since then. In 2011, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was left with brain damage after she was shot in the head at an event in which six people were killed. In 2017, a gunman opened fire at a Republican congressional baseball practice,\u00a0shooting then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others. The nation is also still processing the attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021. One Trump supporter at the rally, Joseph Meyn, saw the former president go down and noticed the man who was killed being hit out of the corner of his eye. With eloquence that was remarkable given the shock of what he saw, he told CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene that the attack was a symptom of a country that was consumed by political fury. \u201cEveryone seems very angry. It just seems like there just a lot of angry people out there. I am not shocked that this happened. I am shocked that I was sitting there and it happened next to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just horrible. We should not be at a level of political discourse in this country where this is going to happen.\u201d \u201cJFK, RFK, MLK \u2026 you (had) an attempt (on) the life of Reagan and now you have an attempted assassination of Trump. It is ridiculous. Politics should not be a zero-sum game where someone wins everything and loses everything.\u201d Another stunning twist to an unfathomable election Saturday\u2019s shocking developments added another volatile political element to a wild and unpredictable election year that has recently seen Biden \u2013 the oldest president in history \u2013 fighting to save his nomination after a disastrous debate performance and the conviction of Trump, 78, by a New York jury and his vows to wage a second term of \u201cretribution\u201d if he\u2019s reelected. The only appropriate initial reaction to the horror was relief that a contender for the presidency is still alive and mourning for the Trump supporter who was killed while exercising their democratic freedoms at the rally. Most leaders and political actors from both sides of the aisle quickly sent prayers to Trump and called for calm. Biden, who has spent days trying to shore up his campaign, swung into his role as the nation\u2019s chief executive after learning of the shooting while he was at mass in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He released a paper statement and then spoke to the nation on camera. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this,\u201d Biden said. He also said that he\u2019d tried to reach \u201cDonald\u201d by phone and said that the ex-president had been at rally that \u201cshould have been able to be conducted peacefully without any problem.\u201d The president, who later was able to connect with his predecessor, ended his weekend at his beach house early and returned to Washington. Given the viciously polarized state of politics in the United States, the initial shock of the assassination attempt will inevitably cause serious political ramifications. Trump was already viewed as an unvanquishable hero by his supporters and treated with almost supernatural reverence at his rallies. His image as a fighter who is constantly under attack from his enemies will now be entrenched even more deeply. In a moment of self-possession after he was hit, the former president made sure to create an iconic moment of defiance \u2013 raising his fist and shouting \u201cfight, fight\u201d to his crowd \u2013 looking directly at the bank of television cameras on a riser. The images will stand in history and enrich Trump\u2019s mythology just as surely as the picture of his mug shot in at Atlanta jail and the footage of his return to the White House in 2020 after beating a serious Covid-19 infection. There could also be unpredictable implications for an election campaign in which Trump was leading Biden \u2013 even before the president\u2019s campaign went into free fall with his disastrous debate performance. And the atmosphere around the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week will be even more intense. Already on Saturday, there were calls for investigations of how a gunman \u2013 outside the security perimeter of the rally \u2013 was able to get Trump in his sights in a massive failure of security that will rumble on for months and will have implications for all future presidential and campaign events. Many politicians on both sides of the aisle are already bemoaning the heat of political rhetoric \u2013 after yet another chilling indication of what it can produce in a nation in which guns are so easily accessed. It remains to be seen if the shock of Saturday\u2019s events, which could have been a lot worse, will do anything to tame a toxic political culture in which Trump is an enthusiastic participant. In one of the most poignant reactions, Giffords said in a statement, \u201cPolitical violence is terrifying. I know.\u201d\u00a0She added: \u201cI\u2019m holding former President Trump, and all those affected by today\u2019s indefensible act of violence in my heart. Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable \u2013 never.\u201d Unfortunately, history suggests that violence, while indefensible, is also a quintessential scar on American politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/trump-shooting-politics-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_cnn-reporter-witness-trump-attack", "text": "CNN reporter Alayna Treene covers Donald Trump and was at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when shots rang out on Saturday. She spoke with CNN\u2019s Zachary Wolf about what she saw. What was supposed to be happening at this event? TREENE: It was honestly going to be a typical rally, like any other. I have now been to \u2013 I can\u2019t even count, upwards of 20 \u2013 the majority of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies since he launched his third bid, and it was a scene like any other. There\u2019s so much security presence. People often remark, \u2018Oh, you have to be safe, be careful.\u2019 And I often feel like being in a rally is one of the safest places, because there\u2019s always so much Secret Service. There\u2019s local law enforcement on the ground. You have to go through several mags (magnetometers). They have very limited options of what you can bring in. With CNN, we get security for ourselves as well, just given the divisive nature of the politics right now. So it was remarkable to me to see what had happened. Where were you situated when the shots rang out? When the shots went off, we were on the riser. We\u2019re in the middle of the crowd. There\u2019s normally a large crowd, and then we\u2019re above them. The risers are elevated. We\u2019re over the crowd so we can see. We\u2019re in line with the stage, and maybe 100 yards from the stage. We had just gone live right at the top of 6 p.m. and had begun listening to Donald Trump. Then, a couple minutes into his speech is when we had heard the pop, pop, pop. From my vantage point, it was to the left side of the stage. It was off of Donald Trump\u2019s right shoulder. At first I thought it was fireworks. I had no idea what it was. Everyone was looking, at least from where I was standing, like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And you could see Donald Trump. He was referencing a graphic showing some border numbers during his administration. And you could see him, his face looking in that direction as well, like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 before he touched his ear and dropped to the ground. From one direction of the stage, off to his right, was where we could hear the gunshots. But then, on the left side of the stage, there was a green tractor, and after the first round of the gunshots, of the bangs that we had heard, I believe that it had hit the tractor or something on the tractor, because immediately there was this cloud. All the steam came out from the other side, the opposite side of the stage. When I talked to people on the ground, they had said that they believed that the bullets had hit something in the truck that made the steam go off. At first I remember being like, \u2018Is this part of the program? What\u2019s happening?\u2019 And then, of course, we heard everyone screaming. Immediately, it went into absolute chaos. Secret Service telling us to get down on the ground. My security guard came up onto the riser and grabbed me. He said we need to get under the risers and pulled me under there, and essentially threw me on the ground and then put his body on top of mine. And I remember, I was like, I need to get up and see what\u2019s happening. But he was holding me and other people around me down, just saying, we can\u2019t move. Stay down. Stay down. And then we could see people started cheering, and I peeked out from under the risers. And that\u2019s when Donald Trump had been starting to stand up with Secret Service around him and putting his fist in the air and being escorted off the stage. And that\u2019s when we crawled back out, and I went back on the risers to figure out what was happening and what to do next. In the video, people can be seen standing behind Trump. Did they immediately know it was gunshots? When interviewing several of the attendees, many of whom were on the bleachers behind him, some who were in one of the very front rows, they had no idea what was going on. Everyone was stunned, including myself. I don\u2019t think anyone had ever expected something like that to happen. I was talking with my producer earlier today. Sometimes you go to these rallies, you go to so many, it\u2019s the same thing. You\u2019re just waiting to hear what Donald Trump has to say. But never in a million years would we have expected an assassination attempt like that. It\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think would ever cross our minds, because you always feel so protected with the amount of law enforcement and Secret Service on the ground. Everyone I spoke with who was there, including the people on the bleachers behind them, they had no idea. The venue was inside these fairgrounds, all grass. You had the large crowd, the press pen with the risers was in the middle of the crowd, and then you had the stage in front of us. But there was a fence, a chain link fence, surrounding all of it, keeping the rally inside. And the people next to the fence, closest to the building where the shooter was, some people over there had noticed and seen that there was a shooter, and they were screaming. And then, you know, shots broke out shortly after that. But the people I talked to who were behind him, they had a similar reaction to me, which was, \u2018Could it have been fireworks?\u2019 I interviewed one man, Joseph Meyn, he said the same thing. At first he thought it could be fireworks. \u2018Could this be part of the program?\u2019 One woman I spoke with today \u2014 her name was Renee \u2014 she was saying she was directly behind Donald Trump, on the stands behind him, and she had said she didn\u2019t really understand what was happening until she saw Donald Trump go down. And that\u2019s when she thought, \u2018Oh, wow, you have to get down. Something really bad is happening.\u2019 What happened next? How did you connect with Meyn? Immediately after, I went back onto the risers. Everyone\u2019s disoriented. People are screaming in the crowd. We went live, basically immediately. I started talking to Wolf Blitzer. A couple of minutes later, Secret Service just started pushing everybody out, unplugging our equipment and screaming at everyone, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out of here. You got to exit the venue. This is an active crime scene.\u2019 They came up to the press, started to tell us we needed to go. Started to pull some of us away and pull us down. (Phone) service also got jammed completely. So at one point we were told that they started to jam all of the towers for all the service. So we couldn\u2019t call anybody. We weren\u2019t sure how to get in contact with DC. Obviously, that was my first goal, when I was just thinking about what to do. But eventually we just started walking out. A lot of the rally attendees were very angry with the press. When I was still on stage, people were screaming at us, saying, \u2018This is your fault.\u2019 I think that they were really seeking an outlet for their anger, and at a Trump rally, Donald Trump often talks about \u201cfake news.\u201d A lot of people yell at us all the time. That\u2019s why we normally bring security. So it was a heightened version of that. We went outside the way that we had come in, and they closed down the parking lot as well. So everyone was trying to get into their cars and leave the site, but they couldn\u2019t. People were stuck in their cars for over an hour, maybe two or three hours, and we did some live shots, but then also we realized people aren\u2019t moving, they\u2019re here. So we just started walking around and saying, \u2018Hi, would you mind doing an interview with us? We\u2019d love to talk about your experience and everyone in those moments.\u2019 Most people felt that they wanted to share what they had seen and what they had felt. And so that\u2019s how those came about. Later Saturday evening, we had seen videos circulating on social media of where the suspected shooter was located and ultimately killed by counter snipers. Given we could not exit the rally area by vehicle, we ran over on foot with our equipment. We were the only camera crew that I saw, at least at that time, who had set up in front of the building. I spotted at least a dozen police cars, some from the sheriff\u2019s department, others state troopers, cordoning off the building. One officer later that evening had confirmed it was where the shooter had fired a series of bullets toward Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/cnn-reporter-witness-trump-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_political-violence-analysis", "text": "The motivations of the gunman who opened fire at former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday are not known, but the incident comes at a time of political anger and anxiety in a country split down the middle and bursting at the seams. Violence has targeted Republicans, Democrats, conservatives and liberals, and seems to be happening with agonizing frequency. \u25ba A plot to assassinate conservative Supreme Court justices was foiled in 2022 by the FBI. \u25ba The husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attacked by a hammer-wielding intruder at their San Francisco home in 2022. \u25ba A violent mob stormed the US Capitol in January of 2021 to interrupt the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win. \u25ba Would-be kidnappers hatched a plot to snatch Michigan\u2019s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 and were sentenced on terrorism charges. \u25ba A GOP congressional baseball team practice was attacked by a gunman in Alexandria, Virginia, in 2017. The then-House GOP Whip, Steve Scalise, was nearly killed. Those incidents range from organized plots to the irrational actions of lone attackers, but they all feed off a desperate and intractable polarization in which apocalyptic language is used to demonize both sides of the political aisle. A major question will be how Trump reacts The Republican National Convention is set to get underway Monday in Milwaukee. Will Trump use the shooting to further feed the idea among his supporters that the country needs to be taken back, or will the former president, who doesn\u2019t believe he lost the last election, call for calm? Americans need to treat this assassination attempt like 9/11 and unify, according to Ian Bremmer, the president of the political risk firm the Eurasia Group. But there is another direction that is more frightening. \u201cI fear it\u2019s going to be a lot\u00a0more like January 6, where there\u00a0will be a large number of\u00a0people that will weaponize what\u00a0just happened. And that we will\u00a0continue to tribalize as a\u00a0country and people won\u2019t accept\u00a0that the people on the other\u00a0side of the aisle are\u00a0American,\u201d Bremmer told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria. In the shocking chaos of the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Trump was encouraging supporters to \u201cfight.\u201d Trump yelled to supporters, pumping his fist, as blood dripped from his head when the Secret Service rushed him from the rally stage. Later, on his social media platform, the presumptive GOP nominee called for national unity. \u201cIn this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\u201d he said. As the gravity of the situation sank in Saturday night, over-the-top rhetoric was on hold, replaced by bipartisan condemnation of political violence and calls to cool things down. In a statement, Biden condemned political violence and called the attack on Trump \u201csick,\u201d while his advisers halted television advertising and put active campaigning on hold. Blaming anti-Trump rhetoric Scalise, now the House majority leader, issued a statement blaming anti-Trump rhetoric, which he said is \u201cfueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America.\u201d \u201cClearly we\u2019ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop,\u201d he added. One of Trump\u2019s potential running mates, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, issued a statement Saturday night, before the identity of the suspected shooter had been released or his motivation was known, blaming political opposition to Trump, and the Biden campaign\u2019s rhetoric specifically, for the shooting. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance said on X. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Trump\u2019s election would not break the country. \u201cYou know, if he wins, democracy is not going to end. He\u2019s not a fascist.\u00a0He represents a point of view that millions share,\u201d Graham said. Calls to calm down Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday that \u201cthe greatest threat to America is that we\u2019re horribly divided.\u201d He said Americans need to spend less time on social media, where divisions grow, and more time out in their communities focused on the things that unite them. Sen. John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat, noted on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Tree of Life Synagogue was attacked in 2018 in nearby Pittsburgh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in that place. It\u2019s the same kind of shock,\u201d Fetterman said. Cycles of political violence \u2018bred in the bone\u2019 The presidential historian Tim Naftali said on CNN that there have been other cycles of violence against presidential candidates in US politics \u2014 frequently at times of social change, including 1968, when Robert F. Kennedy and Marin Luther King, Jr., were shot. He said political violence is \u201cbred in the bone\u201d of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s something we ought to\u00a0remember \u2014 we are capable of this\u00a0as a nation,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe people who do\u00a0it, of course, are outliers,\u00a0but they are a product of the\u00a0extremism and the anger and the\u00a0hatred that sometime pulses\u00a0through our elections.\u201d The gunman, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had apparently been a registered Republican, and would only this year have been old enough to vote in a presidential election. His name is also associated with a $15 donation to a progressive political action committee. The FBI has been warning about the terror threat posed by domestic violent extremists in recent years. Last December, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned of the threat of lone actors as a top domestic threat to the homeland. Not all attacks on politicians are politically motivated John Hinckley was mentally unstable, seeking fame and to impress a Hollywood actress, when he tried to kill President Ronald Reagan in 1981. But the recent string of violent incidents falls into a definite period of division and anger. The Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN that Americans across the board are angry and frustrated. \u201cI look at data all\u00a0the time that says Americans\u00a0are getting angrier and angrier\u00a0about what\u2019s going on in this\u00a0country, that they are getting\u00a0more and more frustrated that\u00a0they think traditional ways of\u00a0solving problems are no longer\u00a0working,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/political-violence-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_local-officer-tried-stop-gunman-trump", "text": "A local police officer saw the gunman on the rooftop during former President Donald Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania rally on Saturday but was unable to engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Sunday. Slupe said that Butler Township officers received calls about a suspicious person outside the perimeter of the rally and went looking to find that person. The initial calls did not indicate the suspicious person had a gun, he said. During the search for the suspicious person, officers with township police discovered that the gunman was on the roof, and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop. Trump, who says he was shot in the ear, was rushed offstage with blood on his face. When asked if the overall security lapse that led to a gunman having a direct line of sight to Trump was a failure, Slupe said it \u201cobviously\u201d was. \u201cThis is being investigated and obviously at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to learn something from it,\u201d Slupe said. He went on to say the agencies were not made aware of intel or red flags ahead of the rally in Butler, which the Trump campaign announced on July 3. About a week before the rally, Slupe said there was a big meeting at which the US Secret Service, state police, township police, bomb squads and other law enforcement entities discussed roles and responsibilities. \u201cEveryone who had a potential role was in that meeting,\u201d Slupe told CNN. There were other meetings for security preparations, but this was the only one Slupe was aware of involving all law enforcement entities. Slupe, who was positioned inside the perimeter near the firing line during the rally, said he didn\u2019t think there was actual gunfire when he first heard the popping noises. He described turning around to see where the noise was coming from and seeing that a rally attendee had been shot.

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_donald-trump-judiciary-courts", "text": "Supporters and opponents of former President Donald Trump agree that the cornerstone achievement of his first term will continue shaping the American legal and political landscape for decades. \u201cI totally transformed the federal judiciary,\u201d Trump boasted at a summit hosted by the right-wing Moms for Liberty group last summer. \u201cMany presidents never get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice. I had three, and they\u2019re gold.\u201d That claim, the numbers show, is not hyperbole. As president, Trump named 234 judicial nominees to seats on the most critical benches across the country, including 54 who reshaped the ideological makeup of federal appeals courts and three who drove a generational shift in the highest court in the land. But as Trump drives toward a potential second term, one thing is clear: He\u2019s just getting started. It\u2019s a reality that thrills supporters \u2013 and strikes fear among even a few right-leaning legal scholars. \u201cI fear that in a second term, you might see a reelected President Trump imposing more of a political test on prospective judges and looking for people who will be more loyal to him personally or to the Republican Party in general,\u201d Gregg Nunziata, the executive director of the conservative Society for the Rule of Law and a former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN. It\u2019s a fear President Joe Biden said was a top concern heading into November. \u201cIt is one of the scariest parts of it,\u201d he said at a star-studded Los Angeles fundraiser last month in response to a question about Trump\u2019s potential court nominees. \u201cLook, the Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today.\u201d Trump campaign officials and allies have made clear that victory in November, paired with what they view as an increasingly likely Republican flip of the Senate, would set the stage for a renewed \u2013 and far more Trumpian \u2013 stamp on the courts. \u201cI will once again appoint rock solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, a great gentleman, and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,\u201d Trump promised a cheering crowd at the Family Research Council\u2019s Pray Vote Stand Summit in September. It\u2019s a promise he made in 2016, and again in 2020, and more than delivered on. Alito and Thomas aren\u2019t just important to Trump as models for future judicial selections. Many allies of the former president see it as likely that one or both could step aside due to age \u2013 and grant Trump the opportunity to cement the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative supermajority for a generation. Trump, who relied heavily on long-standing Republican legal philosophy and counsel from the conservative Federalist Society during his first term, has made it clear he would push sharply right in a second. \u201cI think from both the positions his own lawyers have taken in litigation, what the administration sought to do previously and the extreme proposals in Project 2025, it is clear that there is an effort in this country by the far right to operate in a post-constitutional paradigm,\u201d Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, told CNN. (Project 2025 is the policy playbook crafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation for a potential\u00a0second Trump term.) \u2018We like people in their 30s\u2019 Trump more than delivered on his 2016 campaign promises to name conservatives to the federal judiciary, rivaling the confirmed nominees of presidents who held office for twice as long as he did. But legal scholars note it\u2019s not only the number of Trump nominees that has had such a dramatic impact on the judiciary. It\u2019s who he has nominated that will resonate for decades. \u201cWe like people in their 30s so they\u2019re there for 50 years or 40 years,\u201d Trump told the crowd at the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas in May. Trump\u2019s three Supreme Court picks \u2013 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 while not in their 30s, were all under 55 when he nominated them to the bench. Younger than the average nominee, each could have decades to shape rulings and policy across the country. But the key common denominator among all of Trump\u2019s picks was not their age, but their conservative credentials. \u201cWill you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint?\u201d conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump at a Republican primary debate in 2016. \u201cNot just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?\u201d \u201cYes, I would,\u201d Trump replied, without hesitation. That promise, coming shortly after Scalia\u2019s February 2016 death, helped solidify support for Trump\u2019s candidacy from skeptical Republicans. Once in the White House, Trump relied heavily on the counsel of advisers and outside groups to fill open seats with the help of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was eager to cement conservative domination over the nation\u2019s courts. \u201cYou know what my top priority is. I\u2019ve made it very clear. It\u2019s the judiciary,\u201d McConnell told reporters halfway through Trump\u2019s term. \u201cWe intend to keep confirming as many as we possibly can for as long as we\u2019re in a position to do it.\u201d Working with the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump solidified a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The result has been dramatic \u2013 even with Trump no longer in the Oval Office. Roe v. Wade has been overturned. The EPA and other federal agencies have been stripped of regulatory power. Affirmative action in college admissions has ended. And, in a case deeply personal to Trump himself, a court decision earlier this month granted the president near-total immunity while in office. Trump also helped conservatives flip three of the nation\u2019s 13 appeals courts, which play a significant legal role in shaping policy across the country. And one of Trump\u2019s district court picks \u2013 Judge Aileen Cannon \u2013 is now responsible for overseeing his classified documents case in Florida. Pushing the envelope Trump allies and detractors alike point to a less understood, but clear, shift in the makeup of Trump\u2019s nominations over the course of his first term: a shift away from nominees backed by the powerful conservative legal establishment during his first two years and toward lawyers who embraced more expansive \u2013 and at times legally tenuous \u2013 views of executive power. \u201cSome of Trump\u2019s judicial appointees really push the envelope in an ideological way,\u201d Donald B. Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, told CNN.\u00a0 \u201cThey do things because that\u2019s the result they want to achieve, and that\u2019s just not how the legal system is supposed to work. It\u2019s not supposed to be primarily driven to achieve a given outcome.\u201d It\u2019s a legal philosophy that has been aggressively and financially built up in the years Trump has been out office through a constellation of outside groups populated by former Trump officials and lawyers. Much as former officials have created an outside policy infrastructure around Trump\u2019s campaign, there has been a corresponding effort on the legal front. The groups have repeatedly sued the Biden administration and pressed for investigations into the administration\u2019s actions. But they\u2019ve also served as an unofficial bulwark in their defense of Trump\u2019s own legal travails. \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them,\u201d Trump said of his political opponents in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity last month. That intent for vengeance could set the bar for nominations and administration lawyers alike in a second Trump term. \u201cI don\u2019t say that we should be the mafia,\u201d Will Chamberlain, senior counsel at the conservative Article III Project and a former adviser to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, told this week\u2019s National Conservatism Conference in Washington. \u201cBut as a political party, if we aren\u2019t willing to dish anything out, then we can just expect to keep taking it.\u201d Some in Trump\u2019s circle have even suggested expanding the fight further \u2013 into trying to remove sitting judges, according to John Eastman, an architect of Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election who also spoke at the conservative DC gathering. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start impeaching these judges for acting in such an unbelievably partisan way from the bench,\u201d Eastman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/donald-trump-judiciary-courts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_obama-pelosi-biden-democrats-2024", "text": "Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Joe Biden and the future of his\u00a02024\u00a0campaign. Both\u00a0the former president and ex-speaker expressed concerns about how much harder they think it\u2019s become for the president to beat Donald Trump.\u00a0Neither is quite sure what to do. Democrats are desperate for the dispiriting infighting to end so they can get back to trying to beat\u00a0the former president.\u00a0And they\u2019re begging\u00a0either Obama or Pelosi\u00a0to help them get there, aware that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0doesn\u2019t have\u00a0the trust of Biden\u00a0and\u00a0that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries doesn\u2019t have the depth of relationship to deliver the message. CNN spoke with\u00a0more than\u00a0a dozen members of Congress, operatives and multiple people in touch with both Obama and Pelosi, many of whom say that the end\u00a0for Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0feels clear and at this point it\u2019s just a matter of how it plays out, even after Thursday night\u2019s news conference. And if those two feel otherwise, several leading Democrats say, they need to say that clearly as soon as possible before even more damage is done\u00a0less than four months before the election. Many of Pelosi\u2019s colleagues are hoping that she can bring an end to the turmoil that has engulfed Democrats for the last two weeks.\u00a0And\u00a0to a good chunk of them,\u00a0that end\u00a0can come if and when she tells Biden that he has to drop out. Pelosi has spoken to Biden since the debate, but in the time since, the California Democrat\u00a0has made clear that she does not see Biden\u2019s decision to stay in\u00a0the race\u00a0as final.\u00a0But she, through an aide, declined to comment further. Obama\u2019s\u00a0decision not to make any public comment for two weeks has left a number of leading Democrats feeling like he has left them flailing by holding to the same posture that has largely defined his post-presidency. After the debate, he posted on X,\u00a0\u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d reiterating that sentiment at a fundraiser in New York for House Democrats the night after Biden\u2019s performance. The former president\u00a0hadn\u2019t even planned to make any public statement, but Biden and Obama aides coordinated to get that\u00a0post\u00a0out in a way that reflected Biden campaign talking points that Obama\u2019s first reelection debate in 2012 went badly, too, and it didn\u2019t end up ending his campaign. But Obama\u2019s deepening skepticism about his friend\u2019s ability to\u00a0win reelection is one of the worst kept secrets in Washington. When the history of this extraordinary two-week period of American politics is written, the fingerprints of Obama and Pelosi will be far more apparent than currently known, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, as the Democratic elders have served as a guidepost for a party in panic. \u201cThey are watching and waiting for President Biden to reach a decision on his own,\u201d one longtime Democrat close to all of them told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen as disrespectful to Biden. The Biden campaign declined to comment. While not contesting that the former speaker and Obama have spoken about Biden, a Pelosi spokesperson told CNN after this article first published, \u201cThere is no member of Congress who would have any knowledge of any conversation that Speaker Pelosi would have with President Obama. Anyone who says they do is not speaking the truth.\u201d Obama has been fielding more calls than he\u2019s making, people who have spoken to him say. When he does talk to anxious Democratic donors and officials, he\u2019s been listening more than talking, carefully avoiding taking positions that he assumes would quickly leak. That was also Obama\u2019s approach to the call he had\u00a0with Biden\u00a0after the debate, which the current president has suggested to others included the former president being supportive of\u00a0him\u00a0riding out the turmoil. According to others familiar with the call, though, Obama stuck to his posture of being a \u201csounding board and private counselor.\u201d He prodded. He played devil\u2019s advocate. But he did not take a position. In conversations with some Democrats over the past two weeks,\u00a0Obama has swatted away the notion that he could push Biden one direction or the other even if he wanted to, which underscores their long-running complicated, yet loyal, relationship. And it\u2019s been complicated even further during their time apart: since leaving office behind \u2013 and their weekly lunches at the White House for eight years \u2013 the two have spoken far less than some of their advisers have often intimated. If the former president did try to steer Biden to get out, people who know Obama\u00a0say,\u00a0he is aware the prism through which it could be seen. Biden has written that he felt Obama was not encouraging of his jumping in late to the Democratic primaries in the months after his son Beau died in 2015. Though Obama believes that he was trying to help his then-vice president focus on his grief and not wade into what would have been an incredibly hard\u00a0primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,\u00a0that may not be how another conversation would go. \u201cBiden would say, \u2018Well, Mr. President, you already used that chip in 2015 and it got us Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d speculated a longtime 2020 campaign aide. \u201cI think it would harden him more.\u201d Obama is also loath to give Trump, who is forever triggered by him, any new material by getting actively involved. In the past \u2014 including during the 2020 Democratic primaries \u2014 Obama has seen his role as being the unifier who can help validate\u00a0the direction of the party\u00a0to whichever parts of the party remain skeptical. So far, he has not committed to having that role in the turmoil over whether Biden should remain the nominee, what happens if he stays, or what happens if he changes course and decides to go. \u201cWell he\u2019s known as no-drama Obama,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat. \u201cSo if there\u2019s drama, then he\u2019s the one to deal with it.\u201d Obama\u2019s hands-off approach \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 has been seen by some close to him as a way to keep his powder dry in case he needs to have a blunt, difficult conversation with Biden. \u201cHe is going to be all in for the Democratic ticket. No matter who our nominee is, he will be busting his a** helping to make sure that person wins in November,\u201d said one person who speaks with Obama regularly. Obama has been at Biden\u2019s side during two fundraising events this year, including\u00a0at the\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0event\u00a0last month at which George Clooney would later acknowledge he was alarmed by how Biden carried himself. Biden woke up in Italy the day before the\u00a0fundraiser \u2014\u00a0after several days of G-7 meetings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and had to fly overnight across five time zones to get there, because campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg was eager to do the Hollywood-themed event, and Clooney told the campaign there was only one day he was available, given his shooting schedule. Even on the way there, Obama questioned the thinking of putting any presidential candidate through the wringer of that kind of scheduling. \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney wrote in an essay in The New York Times\u00a0this week,\u00a0imploring Biden to step aside. It was those words that infuriated some Biden loyalists, who suggested that Obama was behind Clooney\u2019s op-ed. The former president, who is friendly with the actor, was aware that it was coming but did not try to stop it.\u00a0To some Obama defenders, that was\u00a0a way of preserving his neutrality, but to some Biden loyalists, it was\u00a0a mark of deep betrayal. Obama was backstage and on stage with Biden for much longer than Clooney was. Others around at the time chalked up the shape the president was in to jet lag. The infamous video\u00a0of Obama\u00a0leading Biden off stage, people familiar say, was more a function of the former president wanting to leave. An Obama aide declined to comment and also declined to say whether his own assessment of Biden\u2019s condition remained that it was about jet lag. Pelosi re-broke the dam As House Democrats left their private caucus meeting on Tuesday morning, many felt the worst might be over for the president. Most of the anti-Biden remarks at the meeting had come from members who had already called for him to go. Then Pelosi went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday morning for a long-scheduled appearance and took advantage of being on a show the president is known to watch to cast major doubt on his candidacy. Privately, she was telling colleagues to hold off on embarrassing Biden while the NATO leaders were in town. But even more Democrats took her comments as an open pass to issue their statements calling on Biden to step aside. Pelosi has known Biden for decades. She is older than him by three years. She has been one of his staunchest defenders, including through the 2020 primaries. She\u2019s finished as speaker and has nothing to lose. \u201cI think at this moment, if Biden ends up stepping down as the nominee, she will prove to be the most important Democratic leader,\u201d said one House Democrat. \u201cShe\u2019s the one in a situation like this, especially generationally, who has the credibility to weigh in on something that is so sensitive and important.\u201d Pelosi plans to fly back home to San Francisco on Friday.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot", "text": "US intelligence discovered earlier this year\u00a0that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer\u00a0that\u00a0has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode. The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort, these sources said.\u00a0The\u00a0plan to kill Armin Papperger,\u00a0a white-haired\u00a0goliath who\u00a0has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature. When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.\u00a0A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US. For more than six months,\u00a0Russia has\u00a0been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe,\u00a0largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism \u2014\u00a0all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv. But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west. Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German\u00a0manufacturer of the\u00a0vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine\u2019s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine\u00a0in the coming weeks, an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow\u2019s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel. The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign \u2014\u00a0one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing sabotage, we\u2019re seeing assassination plots, we\u2019re seeing arson. We\u2019re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,\u201d a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI believe very much that we\u2019re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN\u2019s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it\u00a0shows how Russia is \u201cwaging a hybrid war of aggression\u201d on European allies. \u201cWe have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,\u201d Baerbock said. In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin\u00a0\u201cwill not be intimidated by the Russian threats\ufeff,\u201d emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at \u201cundermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.\u201d A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment. \u201cThe necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,\u201d Hoffman said. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion\u00a0among\u00a0NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country. But the campaign \u2014\u00a0and in particular Russia\u2019s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil \u2014 has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all. Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a\u00a0shotgun\u00a0approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine;\u00a0Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland,\u00a0CNN has reported, a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company. Some analysts have referred to the effort as a \u201chybrid\u201d campaign,\u00a0one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia\u2019s sabotage efforts that way. \u201cI fundamentally reject the idea that what we\u2019re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of \u2018hybrid\u2019, I think of \u2026 defacing monuments,\u201d the senior NATO official said. \u201cThings that meet that traditional definition of \u2018below the threshold of armed conflict.\u2019\u201d Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations \u2014\u00a0lethal action \u2014\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that \u2018hybrid\u2019 implies,\u201d the official said. It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy. Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat\u2019s car:\u00a0US military bases across Europe were\u00a0placed on a heightened state of alert\u00a0last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed\u00a0actors were\u00a0considering carrying out\u00a0sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. In April, two German-Russian nationals\u00a0were arrested\u00a0for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And\u00a0French authorities last month\u00a0detained a Russian-Ukrainian man\u00a0who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it now because they believe that as there are a number of elections happening throughout the west, that this is a prime opportunity to try to undermine public support for Ukraine,\u201d the senior NATO official said. The official also said that Russia sees a window of opportunity before additional weapons and ammunition promised by the west arrive on the battlefield in Ukraine. For Russia, this \u201cis a prime time to target the west in these types of operations to try to undermine support and prevent the flow of weapons there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen, Nadine Schmidt and Chris Stern contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_biden-replacement-process-dnc", "text": "President Joe Biden said something interesting at his rare news conference Thursday when he was asked if delegates pledged to support him at the Democratic National Convention have his blessing to support another candidate. \u201cThey\u2019re free to do whatever they want,\u201d Biden said. The president noted he overwhelmingly won Democratic primaries, which is why nearly all of the convention delegates are currently considered to be pledged to him. But then he added this: \u201cTomorrow, if all of a sudden I show up at the convention and everyone says we want someone else, that\u2019s the democratic process. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he added confidently. Biden is correct that the Democrats\u2019 rules allow delegates to vote for the candidate of their choice. But it\u2019s a little more complicated than he let on. During the roll call vote that officially selects the nominee, for instance, delegates who don\u2019t vote for an acknowledged candidate would have their vote registered as \u201cpresent.\u201d Biden, at the moment, will probably be the only acknowledged candidate and in all likelihood will remain the nominee unless he steps aside. Before Biden\u2019s news conference I talked to Elaine Kamarck about how Democrats pick nominees. Kamarck knows more than most. She is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively as an academic about the primary process and is also deeply involved with the Democratic Party, where she serves on the Rules and Bylaws Committee. She told me how the process of replacing Biden would work considering nearly all of the 3,949 pledged convention delegates are currently pledged to support him. What\u2019s below are excerpts of a longer conversation conducted by phone. Is it unprecedented for a president to face this kind of challenge? KAMARCK: No, it\u2019s not unprecedented. You had it with (Jimmy) Carter. An incumbent president who everybody thought was going to lose, and so there was a check to him (by Sen. Edward Kennedy at the Democratic National Convention in 1980). Certainly LBJ (in 1968) was forced to step down, or he thought he was forced to step down, by a bad showing in the New Hampshire primary and his inability to win over the trust of the anti-war movement. So, yes, presidents have been in trouble before. They\u2019ve never been in trouble for this reason, and never so late in the process. Is it too late to replace Biden? KAMARCK: No, it is not too late to replace him. Sort of legally, according to party rules, he could be replaced anytime up to the roll call at the convention. Politically, it\u2019s very hard to replace him, because with the exception of his vice president, none of the people mentioned have risen to national stature. And their ability to talk to the Alabama delegates, as well as the Maine delegates as well as the Utah delegates is very truncated. And they don\u2019t have time to develop it. We\u2019re just running out of time. (NOTE: Governors like Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, Maryland\u2019s Wes Moore and California\u2019s Gavin Newsom are popular in their states and seen as potential future presidential candidates.) So you think the only viable replacement is Vice President Kamala Harris? KAMARCK: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s not according to the rules or anything, but realistically\u2026 think about who these 4,000 people are. First of all, they\u2019re all very loyal Biden people. So this would require Biden dropping out. Secondly, because she\u2019s been a vice president, she knows them, right? My guess is, of those 4,000 people, she\u2019s actually met a lot of them. That\u2019s not the case for anybody else who\u2019s been mentioned. The 2028 bench is a very strong bench, which is good for the party, but none of them have gotten out of their states yet. Who are the delegates to the DNC who select the party\u2019s nominee? KAMARCK: In most states, they\u2019re elected in congressional district conventions, which follow the primary. (They) file to run as delegates, and then they show up at a certain high school or someplace in their district, bringing as many of their friends and colleagues and supporters as they can. They\u2019re nominated, and they run for the delegate slots. Everybody is elected. And this is very important, because there\u2019s a lot of bullsh** running around about this being a group of elites. These people are the social studies teacher who\u2019s an active union member. These people are a leader in the pro-choice movement, or they\u2019re a county commissioner or a state delegate or something like that. These people tend to be local notables, and they tend to be very politically astute and politically active, because they\u2019ve got to run and get elected. (NOTE: There is also a much smaller group of superdelegates, or \u201cautomatic delegates,\u201d who get delegate status due to their position in the party, but who do not vote for the presidential nominee on the first ballot at the convention unless there is a consensus nominee.) How strong is the 3,949 delegates\u2019 pledge or commitment to Joe Biden? KAMARCK: The rule says \u2013 and the rule has been in effect since the 1984 convention, so it\u2019s long-standing \u2013 that delegates shall, and the operative words are, \u201cin all good conscience vote for the person they were selected to represent.\u201d It\u2019s never been tested. There\u2019s no legal history on what \u2018in all good conscience\u2019 means. Does it mean you just suddenly don\u2019t like the guy? I think probably not. Does it mean you think he\u2019s going to lose and the party will lose? We don\u2019t really know what it means because, since it was put in the rules and the \u2018robot rule\u2019 died, this has never happened. We\u2019ve never had a convention where a lot of people voted against the person that they got elected with. (NOTE: Kamarck writes more for Brookings Thursday about the \u2018in good conscience clause\u2019 and what preceded it, the so-called \u2018robot rule,\u2019 by which delegates were expected to act, essentially, like robots for the candidate who won their state\u2019s primary.) When were the most recent convention fights? KAMARCK: You can go to 1980. The Carter-Kennedy fight was a big fight. It was a real fight on the convention floor. It was bitter. It was angry. Kennedy brought a lot of stuff to the table. In the end, Carter prevailed, but he fought it out. In 1976 with the Republicans, Reagan challenged President Ford. That was a great, big fight. They were very close in delegates, and Reagan lost narrowly and then conceded. Those are the two big ones. You don\u2019t have to go way back in history to see conventions where there was a fight for the nomination. Should Democrats be talking about all of this right now? KAMARCK: I think we have to be talking about this. And I think we have to be looking at him carefully. \u2026 None of us get to see the president every single day, so it\u2019s very, very hard, and that\u2019s why I think Democrats are taking their time to think about this. I went to the Democratic congressional retreat in February, sat 20 feet away from the president and watched him answer questions from Democratic members of the House. He was fantastic. I didn\u2019t see any signs of mental fatigue or fogginess or anything like that. I thought he was fantastic. That very day that I was there, the Hur report came out. It was a very surreal experience to see this report come across the wires on my phone, and to be watching the man who was quite in command of everything. I think there\u2019s a human element to this that everybody\u2019s missing, which is that these things can develop quickly. It\u2019s really hard to tell how serious it is when you\u2019re not with him every day. And so people are being cautious. What would the roll call look like? It\u2019s not clear what Democrats\u2019 roll call will look like at the moment. The Democratic Party is considering a proposal to do a virtual roll call vote weeks before the Chicago convention is set to begin. That plan was originally hatched as a way to\u00a0comply with an early ballot access deadline in\u00a0Ohio. In the meantime,\u00a0Ohio passed a law loosening that deadline. Party leaders may yet carry on with the plan as a way to squash questions about Biden. Read more about that from\u00a0CNN\u2019s Arit John and Ethan Cohen. Democrats who sit on various committees will make those decisions at meetings in the coming weeks. The process for roll call votes is spelled out in a document, the Call for Convention, which spells out the technical rules that do not begin to seem important unless Biden drops out and the nomination is contested. Candidates for president must be nominated, for instance, by between 300-600 delegates, although not more than 50 per state. Superdelegates are restricted from voting in the first round of voting, but only if there is not a consensus nominee. A simple majority of delegates can select a nominee. Et cetera. It should be noted, though, that any of these rules can be changed by a majority of the convention. KAMARCK: The fact of the matter is that these people will descend on Chicago around August 19 and the convention will begin. And everything that goes on between now and then is just straight old politics.

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_trump-injured-pennsylvania-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was wounded Saturday evening while speaking onstage at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in an\u00a0incident that\u2019s being investigated as an assassination attempt from a shooter on a roof near the rally site. Trump was in the middle of delivering his rally speech \u2013 turned toward the right with his hands on his lectern \u2013 when the sound of multiple gunshots suddenly rang out at approximately 6:15 p.m. ET. He said later on social media he was shot in the ear. Trump grabbed his right ear and dropped to the ground as Secret Service agents told him to get down and rushed to the stage, protecting the former president while several more gunshots could be heard. While Trump remained on the ground, there was one last round of shots and loud screams from the crowd. About 45 seconds after the former president was shot, agents were heard on the rally microphone saying, \u201cShooter\u2019s down.\u201d \u201cAre we good to move?\u201d one agent asked. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d asked another. \u201cWe\u2019re clear!\u201d a Secret Service agent said as Trump was lifted to his feet, his face and ear bloodied. The agents prepared to move Trump offstage into his nearby SUV, but he told them to wait. Trump lifted his fist in the air, prompting a loud cheer from the crowd at the rally, and he mouthed the word \u201cfight\u201d three times while pumping his fist. The crowd then chanted \u201cUSA!\u201d as the former president was taken down the stairs by several agents and into his vehicle. One of the rally attendees was killed in the shooting, and and two rally-goers were critically injured, according to the Secret Service. All of the victims were male, according to the FBI. The shocking episode that threatened Trump\u2019s life raises grave questions about security and how the former president was shot at, with lawmakers already calling for an investigation into the Secret Service\u2019s handling of Saturday\u2019s rally. The shooting comes right before Trump is set to accept the 2024 presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention this coming week. President Joe Biden condemned the shooting, saying it was \u201csick,\u201d in remarks from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday evening, and the White House said he later spoke to Trump by phone. Shooter fired multiple times outside the rally venue A law enforcement source and a police officer at the scene told CNN that the shooter was positioned on a building rooftop just outside the venue where Trump was holding his rally, located to the right of the event stage. There was a heavy law enforcement presence around the building. The shooting is being investigated as a possible assassination\u00a0attempt, according to law enforcement officials. The Secret Service said the shooter fired \u201cmultiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue.\u201d The shooter was killed by Secret Service agents, the agency said in a statement. Video posted to social media showed the suspected Trump shooter lying down on the roof of a building, appearing motionless. The FBI is \u201cclose\u201d to identifying the shooter in what they are calling an assassination attempt against Trump, FBI special agent in charge Kevin Rojek said at a press briefing hours after the shooting. Rojek said investigators are close to confirming the identity of the shooter but are not yet releasing the name at this time. Authorities said they believe there Is no other threat. Rojek added that they have not yet identified the shooter\u2019s motive. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday evening, describing the shooting and thanking the Secret Service and law enforcement for their response. \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d Trump wrote. Map: The distance between the suspected gunman and where Trump was shot is approximately 400-500 feet. \u2018It was a bloody scene\u2019 Rep. Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, was sitting in the front row of Trump\u2019s rally with Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick and Rep. Mike Kelly. The congressman told CNN the spectator, who was fatally shot and killed, was \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. Butler County District Attorney Richard\u00a0Goldinger said he was told by his chief detective that the shooter was on a building adjacent to the property. \u201cIt would have required a rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was several hundred yards.\u201d Rico Elmore, a former Pennsylvania legislative candidate who was a speaker at Saturday\u2019s rally, had blood all over his white shirt and was walking away from the rally stage as he spoke to CNN and described jumping over the barrier and putting his hand on the head of an attendee who was shot and bleeding. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d Elmore said. He said he didn\u2019t know the attendee and he was \u201cjust a stranger.\u201d Elmore was visibly shaken up but said he was not harmed. He said he only saw one attendee hit and did not see what happened to Trump. Rep. Ronny\u00a0Jackson, a Texas Republican,\u00a0told Fox News that his nephew was injured during the shooting. Jackson\u00a0said his nephew \u201cwas grazed in the neck, a bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding.\u201d Jackson\u2019s nephew was in \u201cthe friends and family pen, which is to the president\u2019s right, down a little bit lower,\u201d during the rally. The Texas congressman called it a \u201chorrific, horrific experience.\u201d Biden: \u2018It\u2019s sick\u2019 Biden was briefed in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on the shooting. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, Homeland Security\u00a0Secretary Alejandro\u00a0Mayorkas\u00a0and Homeland Security\u00a0adviser\u00a0Liz Sherwood-Randall were part of the team briefing the president. Biden spoke by phone with Trump Saturday evening after the shooting, according to the White House. He also spoke to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Butler Mayor Bob Dandoy. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick,\u201d Biden said before returning to the White House late Saturday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle quickly weighed after the shooting Saturday expressing their horror, condemning the political violence. Leaders around the world sent their well wishes to the former president. \u201cI have been briefed by law enforcement and am continuing to monitor the developments. This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. \u201cI am horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe. Political violence has no place in our country,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he had spoken with McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate from Pennsylvania, who was sitting in the front row of the rally. Trump told McCormick to \u201ccome up here onstage,\u201d Urban said, at which point he heard a few \u201cpops\u201d that sounded like \u201cfirecrackers.\u201d McCormick dropped to the ground at that point, and when he got up, he said that Secret Service agents were \u201caround everybody and they were scattering,\u201d according to Urban. McCormick wrote on X that he and his wife, former Trump administration official Dina Powell, \u201care praying for President Trump and all who were injured today in Butler PA.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

In a brief filing Friday, Smith said that Thomas\u2019 writing in the presidential immunity case \u2013 in a concurrence that no other justice joined \u2013 isn\u2019t binding on US District Judge Aileen Cannon.

In a filing last week, Trump\u2019s lawyers brought to Cannon\u2019s attention both the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling and the concurrence that Thomas wrote in that dispute. That ruling directly arose out of the election subversion case against Trump in Washington, DC, but may have an impact on all four criminal cases against him. Trump\u2019s legal team told Cannon that Thomas\u2019 concurrence bolstered the former president\u2019s arguments for dismissing the charges in Florida on the basis that Smith was illegally appointed and that the funding of his office violates the Constitution. In response on Friday, Smith said that he agreed with Trump that both sides should file more briefing on how the high court\u2019s immunity ruling affects the documents case.

Trump had been holding the event at the Butler Farm Show Grounds on Saturday afternoon. The gunman fired multiple shots from an \u201celevated position\u201d outside the rally, according to the Secret Service. Law enforcement sources told CNN the shooter was\u00a0on a building rooftop\u00a0just outside the rally venue. Trump was injured in the shooting, which the\u00a0FBI says was an assassination attempt. A gunman and at least one audience member are dead, the Secret Service said. The gunman was killed by Secret Service personnel, according to the agency. In a news conference, Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, said it was \u201csurprising\u201d the gunman was able to fire multiple shots during the rally for Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re still working through\u00a0the security apparatus that the\u00a0Secret Service had in place, what potentially happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a long\u00a0investigation into exactly what\u00a0took place and how the\u00a0individual was able to get access\u00a0to the location, what type of\u00a0weapon he had.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event", "text": "In the wake of the\u00a0attempted assassination of\u00a0Donald Trump, there are widespread concerns and questions about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president\u2019s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Sources have described the shooting as coming from the \u201cthree o\u2019clock\u201d position of Trump\u2019s\u00a0podium location,\u00a0with shots coming from his right side.\u00a0Seconds after gunfire rang out, Secret Service counter-assault snipers began shooting the suspect who was found on top of a roof. Notably, the shooter\u2019s location was outside the security perimeter, raising questions about both the size of the perimeter and efforts to sweep and secure the American Glass Research building, and how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access. President Joe Biden said Sunday he has directed US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle \u201cto review all security measures \u2013 all security measures \u2013 for the Republican National Convention.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday\u2019s rally to assess exactly what happened. And I\u2019ll share the results of that independent review with the American people,\u201d Biden said. Law enforcement sources\u00a0say that part of the aftermath will include a review of\u00a0whether the Secret Service had enough assets to protect Trump days ahead of officially becoming the Republican presidential nominee and whether procedures were followed to conduct security sweeps of the building that offered a vantage point for the alleged shooter. \u201cFoundationally, one of the most basic elements of site security, especially a site that\u2019s outside and largely uncontrolled, is (to) eliminate sight lines to this space where the protectee will be either speaking or just occupying,\u201d former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday morning. \u201cWhen you look at that map, it so clearly points to those buildings that are within it, clearly within shooting range.\u201d FBI now leading the investigation into attempted assassination It is not yet clear how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access in relatively close proximity, or why that building was left outside the \u201chard\u201d security perimeter. The FBI is now the lead agency investigating the attempted assassination. But the security lapse issue will be for the Department of Homeland Security and USSS, as well as Congress, to look into. According to CNN affiliate KDKA, a witness says he told officers that he saw a gunman moving \u201cfrom roof to roof,\u201d moments before the assassination attempt. Ben Macer was along a fence line when he saw \u201cthe guy move from roof to roof. (I) told an officer (the alleged shooter) was on the roof,\u201d KDKA reported. \u201cWhen I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that.\u201d Witnesses have also told reporters that they saw a person fitting the description of the alleged\u00a0shooter carrying a rifle outside the security cordon of the rally before the shooting. The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might\u2019ve been acting suspiciously near the event magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. Multiple law enforcement sources told CNN that the shooter had explosive material in his car and residence. The Secret Service does not allow any weapons inside the cordoned off areas of any event. AGR has not responded to questions from CNN about the incident or security. Authorities have\u00a0identified the gunman involved\u00a0in the\u00a0attack\u00a0as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. Multiple law enforcement sources with in-depth knowledge of Secret Service operations have told CNN counter-sniper teams have wide discretion when shooting down a threat. The Secret Service says there were four counter-sniper teams \u2013 two from USSS and two from local law enforcement. The agency says that, at the time of the shooting, Cheatle was in Milwaukee, where this week\u2019s Republican National Convention is being held. Calls from Congress for probes into security \u2018failure\u2019 Republican and Democratic lawmakers are already demanding answers from the agency on the security posture and hearings on the incident. House Speaker Mike\u00a0Johnson\u00a0vowed a \u201cfull investigation\u201d of the shooting, featuring testimony from USSS, DHS and the FBI, and two Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee have also called for an investigation. House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d likewise said that Congress had \u201coversight scrutiny and responsibility,\u201d and said there was a \u201cfailure of the overall broader net.\u201d House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green held a call with Cheatle Sunday afternoon, pressing her on what led to Saturday\u2019s security failures,\u00a0a committee source familiar with the call told CNN. Cheatle committed to providing requested documents to the committee promptly, as able, per the source. Green also detailed the information requests he has with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which include USSS communications and documents surrounding the rally, the source added. The Tennessee Republican sent a letter to Mayorkas earlier Sunday requesting documents about Secret Service security plans and its communications by July 19 and a briefing by\u00a0July 22. House Oversight Chairman James Comer contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and is calling on Cheatle to appear for a hearing\u00a0on July 22. New York Reps. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, and Mike Lawler, a Republican, are also working to introduce a bill they say would give enhanced USSS protection to Trump, Biden and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u201cAs reports continue to emerge, it\u2019s clear that more protection is needed for all major candidates for president,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement provided to CNN. In a separate scathing letter to the Secret Service director on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said that there was a \u201csecurity failure at the highest level, not seen since the attempted assassination of President Reagan.\u201d \u201cThis cannot happen, and I demand accountability,\u201d Gallego, who is running for an Arizona Senate seat, said. Secret Service denies claims that it rejected requests for more security for Trump Secret Service \u2013 along with local law enforcement in Pennsylvania who assisted in securing the rally venue, as well as sources close to Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 is denying rumors circulating on social media, including by a Republican member of Congress, that the agency had denied requests from Trump\u2019s team for more security. In a statement, the Secret Service said the detail had been increased recently. \u201cThere\u2019s an untrue assertion that a member of the former President\u2019s team requested additional security resources and that those were rebuffed,\u201d said Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.\u00a0\u201cThis is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.\u201d The FBI also pushed back on the implication on Saturday night. \u201cThere was no additional request for security that was ever denied by the FBI,\u201d Kevin Rojek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office said during a news conference. The incident also raises questions about security at the upcoming Republican convention. Recently, the questions over how the Secret Service and law enforcement would treat those carrying firearms was raised at a press conference explaining the RNC security plan. A local official, Nick DeSiato, made clear due to Wisconsin law,\u00a0firearms would be allowed in the \u201csoft\u201d perimeter \u2013 an area outside the magnetometers that is limited to foot traffic. Shooting comes after other lapses in protection for high-profile officials The scrutiny comes as the Secret Service has dealt with security lapses in recent months and years. In May 2023, an intruder gained access to the home of Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, despite his round-the-clock Secret Service protection. Sullivan encountered the intruder in his home and alerted his security detail. Sullivan was unharmed. On January 6, 2021, then-incoming Vice President Kamala Harris was driven by her security detail yards away from a pipe bomb outside the Democratic National Headquarters. She was evacuated after law enforcement discovered the pipe bomb which was more than 90 minutes after her arrival. The Secret Service uses intelligence and strategic information to determine security posture. The agency is\u00a0not formally\u00a0part of the intelligence community, and is considered a \u201cconsumer\u201d of intelligence, relying heavily on relationships with agencies such as the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_biden-democrats-2024-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s critical news conference didn\u2019t end his reelection campaign on Thursday night. But it showed why it will be so hard for him to save it. Biden endured his latest agonizing, public test of cognition as he faces a growing torrent of calls from Democrats, worried that he\u2019s destined to lose to former President Donald Trump, to step aside. The president\u2019s deepening reality is that every halting step he takes to tackle his biggest liability \u2014 his age and diminished condition \u2014 the more he highlights it. And his defiance suggests he may be one of the last people to realize it. \u201cI believe I\u2019m the best qualified to govern. And I think I\u2019m the best qualified to win,\u201d Biden told reporters at the NATO summit. But as soon as he finished speaking, he suffered yet another Democratic defection \u2014 from senior House Democrat Jim Himes \u2014 that showed that much of his divided, anxious party doesn\u2019t believe him. Other lawmakers followed before the night was over. The president is therefore at another fateful moment, teed up by one of his most respected political friends, Nancy Pelosi. The former House speaker, who remains one of the most powerful Democrats, suggested earlier this week that despite Biden\u2019s adamant declaration that he\u2019s in the race for good, the summit\u2019s end should usher in new reflection. CNN reported Thursday evening that Pelosi and former President Barack Obama have spoken privately about Biden and the future of his campaign. Another decisive moment is now at hand, and Biden is looking increasingly exposed. Another deeply painful ordeal No president has undergone a trial by news conference like the one Biden endured. His face flinched as reporters questioned his acuity, and he looked wounded when they confronted him with the words of defecting Democrats. Since he\u2019s protected by a loyal circle of friends and longtime aides \u2014 now accused of hiding the extent of his decline \u2014 it is reasonable to wonder whether Biden was learning the full nature of his personal and political plight for the first time. Biden\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t as disastrous as at the presidential debate exactly two weeks earlier. In less fraught circumstances, it might have attracted little comment. But it poignantly revealed Biden for who he now is \u2014 an 81-year-old robbed of his quintessential bombast and the twinkle in an Irish eye. At times \u2014 when Biden discussed gun violence, for example \u2014 his voice rose, and he shook with passion. At others, his theatrical whispering betrayed his age. And as he reminisced about his years in the Senate and old political battles, he came across as a grandfather remembering a life\u2019s triumphs and losses. This is becoming in most octogenarians; in a sitting president who must project vitality to audiences at home and abroad, it\u2019s politically dangerous. Still, Biden managed to address reporters for an hour in the kind of encounter many Democrats have been urging him to use to fill his days. He showed himself still able to lead nuanced discussion on national security issues \u2014 at a far greater depth than Trump \u2014 and insisted his skill at doing the job and a record that compares to any modern Democratic president was proof he was fit to serve a second term and was in its own way a daily test of mental suppleness. The president\u2019s warning that he stood as a bulwark against threats to democracy was especially apt against a statesman\u2019s backdrop of the NATO summit. Biden has led the West more effectively than any president since George H.W. Bush \u2014 and he rightly argued that he was far more in tune with Americans and their fears for democracy than his critics in the midterm elections. Biden\u2019s impossible political vortex But while his Thursday performance may have gone down well with voters already leaning toward Biden, the president desperately needs to win over swing voters in states where recent polls show him losing to Trump. Every public appearance is now a walk along a cognitive high wire. Each sentence could send him crashing to the ground. And it\u2019s all refracted through the prism of a debate with Trump that sent his campaign into a nose-dive. Even before Thursday\u2019s high-stakes news conference, Biden\u2019s evening got off to a bad start when he mixed up the names of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his nemesis, Russian President Vladimir Putin. He quickly corrected a verbal slip that anyone could make. (Trump, for example, has mixed up Pelosi and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.) But it\u2019s happening more and more often to the president. And shortly afterwards, when a reporter asked Biden to weigh in on the qualities of his vice president, he referred to \u201cVice President Trump\u201d instead of Kamala Harris. Such slips don\u2019t alone disqualify him from the presidency. But, large majorities of voters have been telling pollsters for months that they fear Biden is too old. The debate debacle had the classic political impact of confirming a negative impression that voters have already formed. And every subsequent struggle hardens it. It\u2019s becoming more difficult for Democrats to tell voters to ignore the evidence of their own eyes and to argue that Biden is capable of being president until January 2029. That political vortex that Biden cannot escape was underscored when CNN\u2019s Edward-Issac Dovere and Jeff Zeleny reported, after speaking with more than a dozen members of Congress and operatives, that the end for Biden\u2019s candidacy now feels clear and it\u2019s just a matter of how it plays out. Democrats are looking to Pelosi and Obama, they reported, to help end a crisis that presents the party with the momentous possibility of replacing their nominee a month before its convention and less than four months from the election. \u2018Too little, too late\u2019 It\u2019s a measure of how grim things have been for Biden that his uneven news conference was greeted by relief in his camp. One White House official said that Biden displayed \u201csolid command of both domestic topics and foreign affairs.\u201d The official was not wrong \u2014 but the comment ignored that fact that presidents are not solely judged on such matters but on their capacity to communicate and whether they transmit a sense of command. One Democratic congressman acknowledged that Biden had been \u201cstrong\u201d during the news conference. But he added: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t address longer term issues and winning.\u201d This is a key point. Two weeks on from the debate, Biden\u2019s campaign is not just foundering on what he insists is \u201ca bad night\u201d but his inability since to dispel the impression formed in Atlanta. His biggest issue \u2014 cited by every Democrat who tells him to step aside \u2014 is a sense that he\u2019s almost certain to lose to Trump and open the way to an unfettered MAGA movement monopoly on power in Washington aided by a conservative Supreme Court already remaking the fabric of the nation. \u201cWe are doomed if he runs. He\u2019s incapable of running a presidential campaign, and he risks taking the House and Senate down with him,\u201d one person directly involved in Biden\u2019s reelection effort told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee on Thursday night. Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins his party faces a fateful question. \u201cYou have to drop the emotion and the loyalty and love, and say in the next four or five months, is that story (against Trump) going to be told with such precision and poetry and beauty that you will turn around all the numbers that say we are going to lose?\u201d \u201cDo you want to take that risk?\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not just gambling your own political reputation,\u201d he argued, \u201cyou are gambling the future of the United States of America.\u201d Biden is not completely alone. Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that Democrats need to stop their \u201cfantasy games\u201d and unite to beat Trump. But after stalling momentum against him earlier in the week, the president now appears to be in near terminal political decline. His evolving tragedy is that the qualities he touted Thursday \u2014 the wisdom of age, a strong legislative record, global statesmanship and a lifelong refusal to be knocked down \u2014 no longer work against the ravages of time and political gravity. \u201cI\u2019m not in this for my legacy. I\u2019m in this to complete the job I started,\u201d Biden said. But the president\u2019s every act of spelling out why he deserves a second term shows why he may be incapable of winning and fully executing it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/politics/biden-democrats-2024-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_fact-check-joe-biden-nato-press-conference", "text": "President Joe Biden\u00a0held a solo news conference\u00a0on Thursday after a NATO summit in Washington, seeking to reassure voters concerned about his ability to serve and Democratic officials concerned about his ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Biden\u2019s comments included some false and misleading claims. Here is a fact check. Biden\u2019s Putin-Zelensky gaffe moment Biden played down a gaffe he made at an event earlier on Thursday in which he had mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d before correcting himself\u00a0moments later. Biden said at the press conference: \u201cI said, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, Zelensky.\u2019 And then I added five other names.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s last claim was false. He didn\u2019t utter \u201cfive other names\u201d after he corrected the Putin-Zelensky mix-up. In fact,\u00a0after Biden corrected himself, Zelensky said he is \u201cbetter\u201d than Putin, Biden agreed, and then Zelensky delivered remarks as Biden stood silently beside him. Biden\u2019s travels Biden spoke of a need to \u201cpace\u201d himself in his activities. He said, \u201cThe next debate, I\u2019m not going to be traveling 15 time zones a week before. Anyway. That\u2019s what it was about.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading. Biden did not travel abroad \u201ca week before\u201d the June 27\u00a0CNN presidential\u00a0debate in which he performed poorly. In fact, he returned to the US from Europe\u00a012 days before that debate, on June 15. Biden\u00a0attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles on June 15, returned to the White House on June 16\u00a0and\u00a0went to Camp David on June 20\u00a0for intensive debate preparations. He stayed at Camp David until the day of the CNN\u00a0presidential\u00a0debate against Trump, which was held in Atlanta. What Trump said about NATO Biden, criticizing Trump\u2019s position on the NATO military alliance, said, \u201cI think he said at one of his rallies, don\u2019t hold me to this, recently, where, \u2018NATO \u2013 I just learned about NATO,\u2019 or something to that effect. Foreign policy\u2019s never been his strong point.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s comment was indeed inaccurate. Trump did not say at a recent rally that \u201cI just learned about NATO.\u201d Rather, Trump said at the rally that he had not known what NATO was, \u201ctoo much,\u201d prior\u00a0to attending his first alliance summit as president in 2017.\u00a0 Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at his Tuesday rally in Florida: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be obnoxious because I felt, you know, it was the first time I\u2019d ever done this. I went; I didn\u2019t even know what the hell NATO was too much before, but it didn\u2019t take me long to figure it out. Like about two minutes. And the first thing I figured out was they weren\u2019t paying.\u201d (Trump\u00a0continued\u00a0by making his\u00a0usual false claims\u00a0about NATO\u2019s funding structure.) Biden is entitled to criticize Trump for this profession of prior ignorance about NATO or for his continued inaccuracy about NATO, but Biden\u2019s comments made it sound like Trump had acknowledged he had just learned about NATO\u00a0now\u00a0rather than seven years ago. Hamas and the West Bank Talking about the war between Israel and Hamas, Biden said Thursday, \u201cThere is a growing dissatisfaction in, on the West Bank, from the Palestinians, about Hamas. Hamas is not popular now.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0The limited available public opinion polling suggests the claim that \u201cHamas is not popular now\u201d in the West Bank is not true \u2013 and that Hamas\u2019 popularity has\u00a0increased there\u00a0since its attack on Israel last October.\u00a0 A\u00a0poll taken in late May and early June by a well-known pollster based in the West Bank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, found that 73% of respondents in the West Bank supported the October attack by Hamas, that 82% of respondents in the West Bank\u00a0were satisfied with Hamas\u2019 performance in the current war with Israel and that 71% of respondents in the West Bank\u00a0preferred Hamas to control the Gaza Strip after the war. Hamas scored better on all of those questions among the respondents in the West Bank than it did among the respondents in Gaza. In addition, Hamas had the support of\u00a0about half the West Bank respondents\u00a0who said they would vote\u00a0in hypothetical parliamentary elections \u2013 double its support level in a poll nine months prior and more than double West Bank respondents\u2019 support in the latest poll for more moderate rival Fatah. Biden\u2019s endorsement from the United Auto Workers When a reporter told Biden that Reuters had reported Thursday that the leadership of the United Auto Workers union was concerned about Biden\u2019s ability to win the election, Biden responded, \u201cUAW just endorsed me, but go ahead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that the UAW \u201cjust\u201d endorsed him is misleading at best. The UAW actually\u00a0announced its endorsement of Biden on January 24, more than five months ago. In other words, Biden attempted to dismiss the\u00a0reported post-debate concerns of UAW president Shawn Fain\u00a0by insinuating that Fain\u2019s union had made a recent decision to back Biden. But the endorsement actually came long before the debate and the resulting crisis of confidence among some of Biden\u2019s pre-debate backers. The war in Afghanistan Biden spoke of how he had encouraged Israeli leaders not to \u201coccupy anywhere\u201d and instead target the Hamas terrorists who attacked their country, avoiding the mistakes the US made after it was attacked on September 11, 2001. Biden said, \u201cYou may recall, I still get criticized for it, but I was totally opposed to the occupation and trying to unite Afghanistan. Once we got bin Laden,\u201d in 2011, \u201cwe should\u2019ve moved on, because it was not in our \u2013 no one\u2019s ever going to unite that country.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that he was \u201ctotally opposed to the occupation\u201d of Afghanistan is misleading at best. In the early years of the war, Biden, then a US senator for Delaware, was a vocal public supporter of the US having a sustained military presence in Afghanistan and engaging in extensive \u201cnation-building\u201d there \u2013 and he explicitly rejected the idea of a narrow military mission targeting terrorists. Biden did eventually change his mind,\u00a0becoming\u00a0a\u00a0sharp internal critic\u00a0of the war as President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president beginning in 2009; he\u00a0opposed\u00a0Obama\u2019s\u00a0\u201csurge\u201d of additional troops\u00a0into the country. But Biden\u00a0has\u00a0repeatedly suggested\u00a0he always opposed the idea of a US military presence and nation-building\u00a0efforts\u00a0in Afghanistan, and that\u2019s incorrect. In an\u00a0October 2001 speech in the Senate, Biden outlined a broad agenda for a \u201clong-term solution\u201d in Afghanistan, which he said would involve everything from \u201cthe restoration of women\u2019s rights\u201d to \u201cbuilding basic infrastructure\u201d to the \u201ccreation of secular schools\u201d to the establishment of a \u201ccrop substitution program for narcotics\u201d \u2013 and said that it would be unwise to simply go after terrorists. He said, \u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. If we think only in the short term, only of getting bin Laden and the Taliban \u2013 which we must do, but that is not all we must do \u2013 we are just begging for greater trouble down the line.\u201d In a speech in February 2002, after the Taliban regime was ousted, Biden\u00a0said, \u201cLike it or not, our leadership role must include soldiers on the ground, in my view. If others step forward and we are not needed on the ground, fine. But whatever it takes, we are going to have to be sure that there is a robust security force not only in Kabul but in every major municipal center in that country if there\u2019s any prospect of transitioning to a government that is stable two years down the road, has a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of succeeding, and is able to transition into a military and a police force that is a basic necessity for governance there.\u201d He continued: \u201cHistory is going to judge us very harshly, I believe, if we allow the hope of a liberated Afghanistan to evaporate because we are fearful of the phrase \u2018nation-building\u2019 or we do not stay the course.\u201d And in\u00a0comments\u00a0on Afghanistan at a February 2003\u00a0meeting of the Senate\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Relations\u00a0Committee, Biden said, \u201cIn some parts of this [President George W. Bush] administration, \u2018nation-building\u2019 is a dirty phrase. But the alternative to nation-building is chaos \u2013 a chaos that churns out bloodthirsty warlords, drug traffickers, and terrorists. We\u2019ve seen it happen in Afghanistan before, and we\u2019re watching it happen in Afghanistan today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/fact-check-joe-biden-nato-press-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-vacation-homes", "text": "Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Tuesday that President Joe Biden has more homes than Trump does and that Biden has homes in four expensive holiday destinations. At a campaign rally in Florida, Trump argued that Biden has spent excessive time on vacation during his presidency. \u201cAnd mansions are in \u2013 think of this \u2013 here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s been a politician all his life. He\u2019s got homes in the Virgin Islands, Nantucket, Lake Tahoe, Kiawah Island. I mean, where the hell did they get all this money, Byron?\u201d Trump said, speaking to Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. \u201cHe\u2019s got more homes than I do. What the hell is going on with him?\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. First, Biden does not have homes in any of the four places Trump claimed he does; rather, Biden has stayed at others\u2019 homes in those places. Second, Trump owns more homes than Biden does. Biden owns two houses, both in Delaware, and there is no mystery about how he afforded them. Biden\u2019s homes Biden\u2019s primary home, in a suburb of Wilmington, Delaware, is a 6,850-square-foot house Biden and his wife Jill Biden built on a lot they bought for $350,000 in 1996, 23 years into his tenure as a US senator representing Delaware. Biden\u2019s vacation home is a beach house near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, that he and Jill Biden bought for about $2.7 million in 2017. They made the purchase after they signed a lucrative three-book deal earlier that year as private citizens following his vice presidency. The Bidens disclosed the book income in tax filings they released to the public in 2019. The filings showed they had earned a total of about $15.6 million in 2017 and 2018. About $13.3 million of that was from the book deal and related paid speeches. Biden\u2019s vacations\u00a0at others\u2019 homes  As president, Biden has stayed at the homes of wealthy associates in the four vacation destinations Trump mentioned. Biden does not have his own homes in any of them. Biden has stayed at a US Virgin Islands home owned by Democratic donors Bill and Connie Neville, whom the White House has described as his friends; at a Nantucket, Massachusetts home owned by private equity titan and longtime friend David Rubenstein; at a Lake Tahoe-area Nevada home owned by prominent Democratic donor Tom Steyer; and a Kiawah Island, South Carolina home owned by campaign donor Maria Allwin. The White House said in 2023 that the Biden family was renting the Steyer home for \u201cfair market value,\u201d and Politico reported in 2021 that the Bidens were renting the Rubenstein home, but the White House has not released specifics on the financial arrangements related to their stays at the four properties; it\u2019s possible that some of the stays have been free. Regardless, Trump\u2019s assertion that they are Biden\u2019s own properties is wrong. Trump\u2019s homes\u00a0 There is no comprehensive current list of the homes Trump owns, and it can be hard to separate his personal home ownership from his business interests \u2013 for example, to decide if unsold condominiums in Trump developments should count as Trump homes. But it is clear by any reasonable measure that the billionaire real estate businessman owns more homes than Biden\u2019s two. Trump\u2019s primary residence is at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. He continues to own his former primary residence, a triplex penthouse at his Trump Tower in New York City. He also has a mansion on more than 200 acres in the suburbs of New York City, a private villa at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, and an estate on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin that his company has tried to sell for years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-vacation-homes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_biden-say-trump-shooting-bullseye", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said President Joe Biden should be \u201ccalled out\u201d for political attacks on former President Donald Trump that have contributed to what he described as a \u201cheated political environment.\u201d He urged political leaders\u00a0on both sides of the aisle\u00a0to \u201cturn the rhetoric down\u201d the morning after Trump was injured onstage in a shooting\u00a0during\u00a0a Pennsylvania campaign rally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to turn the temperature down in this country,\u201d Johnson said on\u00a0NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cWe need leaders of all parties, on both sides, to call that out and make sure that happens so that we can go forward and maintain our free society that we all are blessed to have.\u201d He then pointed to Democratic criticism of Trump less than four months from this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWhen the message goes out constantly that the election of Donald Trump would be a threat to democracy and that the republic would end, I mean it heats up the environment,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said on NBC. \u201cWe cannot do that. It\u2019s simply not true. Everyone needs to turn the rhetoric down.\u201d The House speaker\u2019s comments echoed those of many other Republicans, including Trump\u2019s campaign, some of his top allies on Capitol Hill and at least one top contender for his vice presidential nomination as the party prepares to gather in Milwaukee this week for its nominating convention. One rally attendee was killed and two were critically injured, in addition to Trump, in the shooting. The FBI described the shooting as an assassination attempt and identified the gunman, who was shot and killed on the scene, as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Crooks was a registered Republican who had previously made a small contribution to a Democratic-aligned group in 2021, according to public records. So far investigators haven\u2019t found any initial signs or social media or other writings that help provide a motive, law enforcement officials say. In the moments after the failed assassination attempt at Trump\u2019s rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, Republicans \u2014 energized by a bloody Trump\u2019s defiant fist pump as Secret Service agents escorted him off stage \u2014 erupted in anger over what they described as years of Democratic persecution of Trump and his supporters. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a potential Trump vice presidential pick, said on X shortly after the shooting that Biden\u2019s rhetoric was to blame. \u201cToday is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, another potential VP pick and top Trump ally, said on X: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: This was an assassination attempt aided and abetted by the radical Left and corporate media incessantly calling Trump a threat to democracy, fascists, or worse.\u201d Trump campaign manager\u00a0Chris LaCivita\u00a0said on X that Biden, Democratic donors and leftist activists for years have made \u201cdisgusting\u201d comments targeting Trump and should be held accountable \u2014 \u201cthe best way is through the ballot box,\u201d he wrote. Johnson, LaCivita and others pointed to language Biden used in a recent private call with donors during which he urged Democrats to drop their ongoing conversations about whether the 81-year-old president should exit the race in the wake of his poor performance in his June presidential debate with Trump, and shift their focus back to defeating Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re done talking about the debate. It\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d Biden said on that call, a recording of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cPresident Biden himself said in recent days, \u2018It\u2019s time to put a bullseye on Trump.\u2019 I know he didn\u2019t mean what is being implied there, but that kind of language on either side should be called out,\u201d Johnson said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show on Sunday. \u201cWe have to make clear that this is part of our system we can have vigorous debate but it needs to end there.\u201d Some remarks from congressional Republicans were more incendiary. \u201cEvery American should be outraged at Joe Biden for inciting violence against Donald J. Trump,\u201d Texas Rep. Keith Self said on X, highlighting Biden\u2019s \u201cbullseye\u201d remark. Trump has often used violent imagery himself, including warning that the country faces a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if Biden wins in November. His supporters attacked police officers and broke doors and windows as they stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn the 2020 election results amid Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud. The former president has also mocked the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was attacked by an assailant with a hammer at their San Francisco home in 2022. The former president also has often said Biden is the real threat to democracy, and claims the president would dissolve US borders. In the June debate, repeating a claim that is a staple of Trump\u2019s rallies and speeches, he said if Biden wins in November, \u201cwe probably won\u2019t have a country left anymore, that\u2019s how bad it is.\u201d Biden spoke from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Saturday evening, saying he had been \u201cthoroughly briefed\u201d on the shooting. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d Biden spoke to Trump by phone Saturday night. A source briefed on the call described it as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cshort and respectful.\u201d A senior White House official also briefed on the call similarly described it as \u201cbrief and respectful.\u201d The official said Biden repeated his assertion there was no place or tolerance for political violence and assured him he was directing agencies for a full investigation. The shooting had at least momentarily halted Democrats\u2019 political attacks on Trump, as Biden\u2019s campaign paused all television advertising and communications efforts on Saturday night. Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her trip to Florida in response to the shooting, according to a campaign official. She had originally planned on traveling to Palm Beach on Tuesday for a moderated conversation alongside Republican women to discuss Trump\u2019s stance on women\u2019s reproductive rights. The Biden campaign and Democrats across the party were scrambling Sunday to determine how to adjust their counter-messaging plans for the Republican National Convention in the wake of the assassination attempt. \u201cThe big issue is how to campaign against him or attack him,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN. \u201cCan we even do that this week?\u201d The adviser said discussions are underway to calibrate attacks and criticism aimed at Trump to focus on policy differences, rather than personal attacks. Plans that had been underway for weeks to respond to the GOP convention are being reviewed and potentially adjusted. The Biden campaign has yet to decide when to resume its advertising campaign against Trump, which was suspended Saturday night after the shooting. But that, a separate Democratic strategist said, was the easy decision. A harder question is how and when to resume, with 114 days until the election. While public calls for Biden to step aside have cooled in the aftermath of the attack, the concerns voiced directly to the president in calls on Saturday have hardly gone away. A White House official said Sunday the president would continue his outreach to lawmakers and supporters, but would turn his immediate focus to his presidential duties of directing the government\u2019s response to the first assassination attempt of a former president and presidential candidate in more than four decades. Other Democratic leaders similarly condemned the shooting. \u201cPolitical violence has no place in our country,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries similarly said in a statement that political violence is \u201cnever acceptable.\u201d GOP South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d he was supposed to play golf with Trump on Sunday and plans to see the former president later in the day. \u201cI wish I could say I was surprised, but I\u2019ve been worried about this for a very, very long time. You know, if he wins democracy is not going to end. He\u2019s not a fascist. He represents a point of view that millions share. The rhetoric is way too hot, but I was just grateful that he made it,\u201d he said. Graham praised his Democratic colleagues for their responses, saying \u201cit\u2019s good to see.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes,\u00a0Jeff Zeleny,\u00a0Hannah Rabinowitz, Evan Perez\u00a0and Danya Gainor contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/biden-say-trump-shooting-bullseye/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_politics_trump-biden-presidential-election", "text": "If you follow my work, you know that I\u2019ve tended to be pessimistic about President Joe Biden\u2019s chances of reelection. There are plenty of reasons for that \u2013 for instance, he\u2019s trailing in the polls both nationally and in swing states, and has an approval rating south of 40%. But sometimes it\u2019s worth taking a step back and looking at the counterargument. Biden\u2019s been through arguably two of the worst weeks for a president running for reelection that I can recall, and he\u2019s still within earshot of former President Donald Trump. If you average the national polls since the debate 15 days ago, Trump\u2019s ahead by 3 points.\u00a0An NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll out Friday morning even put the race at 50% for Biden to 48% for Trump (a result within the margin of error). No one should be comfortable calling the presidential race with these sorts of polling results. Since 1972, the average difference between the polls at this point and the eventual result has been 6 points. Sometimes races change by far more than that. Democrat Michael Dukakis led Republican George H.W. Bush by mid-to-high single digits at this point in 1988 before the party conventions. By the time the race was over, Bush had defeated Dukakis by 8 points. Biden and Trump\u2019s own history should make you think twice about calling wraps on this race as well. Biden was ahead by 9 points in the early July national polls in 2020. He ended up winning the national popular vote by only half that (4.5 points). Such a shift in Biden\u2019s direction this time around would put him over the top in the popular vote. Of course, this election will ultimately come down to the pivotal battleground states. The post-debate data from those states is limited, though the polling we had from before the debate suggested that Biden was doing worse in those states taken as a whole than he was nationally. Biden\u2019s clearest path, according to the public data (and both campaigns), continues to be through the northern battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Wins in all three would likely mean Biden can lose Arizona, George, Nevada and North Carolina and still pull off a victory. Looking at the forecasting models Figuring out how to account for all this information (or lack thereof) to better understand the state of the race between Biden and Trump can be a challenge. One way to do that is through forecasting models, which look at a lot of data, including current national polls, current swing-state polls, the time until the election (i.e., how much polling can shift over time) and even the state of the economy (e.g., strong job reports and less positive data about income growth). I love to check these forecasting models and have even assisted with building some in the past because they help ground us in objective facts and not subjective opinions. Models like these cannot account for everything (e.g., we\u2019ve never had a rematch between two presidents in the polling era), but they are far better than conjecture. Per the average forecasting model, Biden wins about 30% of the time against Trump. Some might view a 3-in-10 probability as low. I wouldn\u2019t read it that way. If the current model average is to be believed, Biden has a better chance of winning this election than a flipped coin\u00a0landing on heads twice in a row. Any young student or NFL captain can tell you that flipping heads twice in a row happens all the time, despite it not being the more likely outcome. For the politically obsessed, a different example might hit closer to home. When I worked at FiveThirtyEight \u2013 my then-boss Nate Silver now has a model that looks similar to the current average \u2013 we gave Trump about a 30% chance of defeating Hillary Clinton on the eve of the 2016 election. As I wrote at the time, Trump was a \u201cnormal polling error behind Clinton\u201d \u2013 the idea being that the polls were close enough that Trump could win if the polling was off by a normal amount. Today, the situation is somewhat different. Biden\u2019s Electoral College path does seem to be narrower than Trump\u2019s was in 2016. What Biden does have that Trump didn\u2019t in 2016 is time. We\u2019ve already seen over the past few weeks since the debate that a lot can change in a short period. So what do all these facts and figures mean? I think it\u2019s totally fair to say that Trump is the favorite and that Biden has his work cut out for him. There is also data to suggest that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger\u00a0Democratic nominee against Trump than Biden. (I tend to believe Democrats would do better with Harris leading the presidential ticket.) But if you currently think Biden can\u2019t win, history would disagree with you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/politics/trump-biden-presidential-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim", "text": "Firefighter Corey Comperatore was killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Sunday. Comperatore was one of the thousands of people who attended the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection effort. He died trying to protect his family, according to the governor. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed his identity on Sunday. \u201cCorey was a husband, a father, a volunteer firefighter, a hero sheltering his family from those bullets. We should all hold his family and all those injured in our prayers,\u201d President Joe Biden said in an address from the Oval Office on Sunday night. Authorities have\u00a0identified the gunman\u00a0in Saturday\u2019s\u00a0attack\u00a0as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI is investigating the attack as an assassination attempt, the agency said. \u201cI just spoke to Corey\u2019s wife and Corey\u2019s two daughters,\u201d Shapiro said Sunday. \u201cCorey was an avid supporter of the former president and was so excited to be there last night with him in the community,\u201d the governor said. \u201cI asked Corey\u2019s wife if it would be okay for me to share that we spoke. She said \u2018yes.\u2019 She also asked that I share with all of you that Corey died a hero,\u201d Shapiro added. \u201cCorey dove on his family to protect them last night at this rally.\u201d \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family,\u201d said Shapiro. Shapiro said he has directed flags be flown at half-staff in Comperatore\u2019s memory. In addition to Comperatore, two people were critically injured in the incident, according to Pennsylvania State Police. David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition, state police said in a press release. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc. identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization\u2019s location in Westmoreland County. Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook that Dutch underwent two surgeries after being \u201cshot in the liver and chest.\u201d \u201cThese victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\u201d said state police commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. \u201cThe Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\u201d The former president was shot in his right ear, he said on social media, leaving his face covered in blood. A GoFundMe campaign for the victims\u2019 families, verified by the fundraising platform, had raised over $3 million by Sunday afternoon, more than triple its initial goal. More than 42,000 donations have poured in, according to the website. Speaking Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden expressed his condolences to the Comperatore\u2019s family. \u201cWe also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a father; he was protecting his family from the bullets being fired when he lost his life. God love him. We are also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured.\u201d Shots fired, then \u2018a bloody scene\u2019 Witnesses have described a wave of chaos and terror that unfolded after the shooter, perched on a rooftop just outside the venue, fired several shots from an AR-style weapon. As shots rang out and the former president ducked below the podium, swarmed by Secret Service agents, attendees screamed and crouched toward the ground, video from the scene shows. \u201cIt was just the scariest thing, there was not a lot of places you could hide there,\u201d witness Amber DiFrischia told CNN. DiFrischia and her husband, Mike captured video of the moment the shooter fired his gun. The video shows the gunman laying on the rooftop with his weapon drawn, and eventually shows the gunman deceased. When the couple realized he had a gun, Amber said she immediately began yelling at officers and pointing to where he was located. The couple said that many of the officers were too close to the building to see the gunman on the roof. Mike saw one officer attempt to climb onto the roof, but the officer eventually fell back to the ground. GOP Congressman Dan Meuser told CNN he was sitting in the front row of the rally with Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick and Republican Rep. Mike Kelly. He saw a man fatally shot \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them, he said. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from Grove City, Pennsylvania, told CNN that he helped carry a man\u2019s body out of the stadium. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. He was to the far right of the podium, filming Trump\u2019s speech, when he heard the gunshots. \u201cJust as I was panning back, I heard seven gunshots in rapid succession, in under two or three seconds. I am familiar with guns, I knew immediately it was gunfire,\u201d Meyn told CNN. \u201cI saw him get hit.\u201d Meyn said he looked back in the direction the gunshots had come from. \u201cI saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head \u2026 there was a woman who was hit in the hand and forearm, a noncritical wound.\u201d He said he went over to see if he could render any aid, but another doctor was already tending to the woman who\u2019d been shot. \u201cI helped carry the body of the man out of the stands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers.\u201d Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas said that his nephew was also injured in the shooting. In an interview with Fox News, Jackson said his nephew \u201cwas grazed in the neck, a bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding.\u201d The congressman called it a \u201chorrific, horrific experience.\u201d Another attendee who witnessed the shooting described an atmosphere of \u201ccomplete shock.\u201d \u201cIt was too close for comfort,\u201d Donna Hutz told CNN. She and her son were just a few rows in front of the attendees who were shot. She looked up and saw the injured attendees with lots of blood covering the bleachers, she said. The shooting created shockwaves around the world, with international leaders including Biden, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Vatican condemning the attack and political violence more broadly. Authorities are still investigating both the shooter\u2019s possible motives and how he was able to access the area with a weapon. \u201cIt is surprising, but all the details of that will come out in the investigation,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said in a news conference when asked how the shooter was able to fire several shots.
