King\u00a0was expected to face an Article 32 hearing, which is a preliminary hearing in a military court, on Tuesday at Fort Bliss, Texas, but the hearing was delayed, according to a spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s Office of Special Trial Counsel.\u00a0King\u2019s attorney, Frank Rosenblatt, told CNN in a phone call that the delay was the result of a joint request from both sides as negotiations are ongoing. \u201cWe are negotiating a resolution and because of that, no need to have the [Article 32 hearing] right now,\u201d Rosenblatt said, adding that the Article 32 hearing has been delayed for two weeks\u00a0and would likely not\u00a0be necessary if a plea agreement is reached. King\u00a0is facing eight charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including desertion, possession of child pornography, assaulting a noncommissioned officer, and disobeying a superior officer. His case was taken over by the Army\u2019s Office of Special Trial Counsel \u2014 a new office within each of the military services that handles the prosecution of crimes such as murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and domestic violence \u2014\u00a0on July 10, the spokesperson for the office, Michelle McCaskill, told CNN. Rosenblatt declined to provide details of the plea agreement which was first reported by Stars & Stripes. A spokesperson for OSTC declined to comment on the possibility of a plea deal but said prosecutors did not object to delaying the Article 32 hearing. Roughly a week before fleeing into North Korea in July 2023,\u00a0King\u00a0had been released from a detention facility in South Korea, where he\u2019d been held over after an October 2022 incident in which he allegedly pushed and punched a victim in the face at a club in Seoul. The day he crossed the border into North Korea,\u00a0King\u00a0was supposed to have boarded a flight back to Texas, but he instead left the airport after US Army escorts left him at the security checkpoint. King\u00a0was returned to US custody last September. Since his return, Rosenblatt said\u00a0King\u00a0spent three weeks at the Defense Department\u2019s reintegration center, run by US Army South in San Antonio, Texas. He then went to Fort Bliss; when he arrived, Rosenblatt said,\u00a0King\u00a0was ordered into pre-trial confinement where he has remained since October 18. He is now being held in a detention center in New Mexico that is run by a company contracted by the Army, Rosenblatt said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/travis-king-plea-negotiations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-vaccine-skepticism", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s son, Bobby Kennedy III, posted a video of a phone call between Kennedy and former President Donald Trump in which the former president appeared to endorse false theories about the safety of vaccines. Kennedy III posted a brief video on social media Tuesday morning filming Kennedy Jr. as he listens to Trump speak on the phone. Kennedy III said the video was taken on Sunday, the day after Trump was injured during a shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Kennedy III deleted the post containing the video hours later. In the video, Trump can be heard discussing the amount of doses of vaccines that are scheduled for children, and suggested that after taking a high volume of vaccines, \u201cyou see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically.\u201d \u201cWhen you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is, like, 38 different vaccines and it looks like it\u2019s been for a horse. Not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby,\u201d Trump says on the call. \u201cAnd then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I\u2019ve seen it too many times.\u201d Trump also appeared to express some skepticism toward public health professionals who accurately state the recommended immunization schedule for children is safe and effective, saying, \u201cAnd then you hear it doesn\u2019t have an impact, right?\u201d By age 6, children may receive vaccinations that protect them from\u00a016 different diseases, including life-threatening infections such as measles, pertussis and polio. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccines are recommended for very young children\u00a0before\u00a0they are likely to come into contact with serious diseases, as they are at highest risk of serious illness or death. Vaccines are often combined into a single dose in order to\u00a0reduce the number\u00a0of office visits and shots. Needles used for\u00a0infant vaccines\u00a0are typically an inch or less long, and for some vaccines, dose sizes for the very young are smaller than those used for older children or adults. Some infant vaccines are also administered orally, and certain flu vaccines for people as young as 2 can be administered as a nasal spray. Kennedy Jr. apologized to Trump for the video of the phone call being released after his son took the video down. \u201cWhen President Trump called me, I was taping with an in-house videographer. I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted. I apologize to the president,\u201d Kennedy wrote on social media Tuesday. When asked whether Trump knew he was being recorded, Trump\u2019s advisers pointed CNN to Kennedy\u2019s tweet, in which he said a videographer was filming him for a separate project. The Biden campaign said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cTrump and his anti-vax bud \u2018Bobby\u2019 are spreading dangerous conspiracy theories that threaten the lifesaving care that tens of millions of people depend on.\u201d \u201cThis leaked footage is further proof Trump can\u2019t be trusted to protect Americans\u2019 health care. It\u2019s frightening, and if he gains power, it could be the devastating reality for working families across the country,\u201d the statement said. CNN has reached out to the Kennedy campaign and Trump campaigns for comment. The phone call shown in the video came one day before Trump and Kennedy met in Milwaukee. Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear told CNN the two presidential candidates discussed \u201cnational unity\u201d during the meeting. A source familiar with the conversation said the two also discussed Trump\u2019s vice presidential nomination decision hours before he selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. In January 2017, before Trump was inaugurated, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to lead a commission to study vaccine safety following a meeting between the two at Trump Tower in New York. The commission ultimately never materialized. Trump appeared to reference the meeting in the clip of the phone call. \u201cYou and I talked about that a long time ago,\u201d Trump tells Kennedy on the call. Trump has long entertained vaccine skepticism, but his stance toward vaccines has taken added political urgency after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic a major issue during the Republican primary. Trump has said he would defund any public school that enforces vaccine mandates. The policy agenda on his campaign website questions the origins of \u201can unexplained and alarming growth in the prevalence of chronic illnesses and health problems, especially in children.\u201d As a candidate, Kennedy has repeatedly made false claims about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. He\u2019s regularly criticized Trump for approving public health restrictions during the pandemic and implementing a plan to accelerate the development of a Covid vaccine. Kennedy often attempts to link Trump to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who helped lead the US Covid response during the Trump and Biden administrations and has become a focal point of criticism from some on the right. All vaccines that are approved or authorized for use in the United States have been proven safe and effective through rigorous scientific study. Childhood vaccinations are particularly important because they train the body\u2019s immune system to recognize viruses it has not yet been exposed to, and protect the body from the harmful effects of those viruses. Severe allergic reactions are exceedingly rare \u2013 occurring in roughly 1 in 1 million people. Far more common are mild side effects, such as pain or swelling at the injection site, which tend to subside quickly. Worldwide, vaccines prevent more than 4 million deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization. And while there is still no scientific consensus on what causes autism, vaccines, conclusively, do not. Trump also discussed with Kennedy the shooting on Saturday, which left him wounded in his right ear, and the phone call he received from President Joe Biden following the assassination attempt. \u201cHe was very nice actually. He called and he said, \u2018How did you choose to move to the right?,\u201d Trump says in the video of his call with Biden. \u201cI said, \u2018I was just showing a chart.\u2019 I didn\u2019t have to tell him the chart was going all the people pouring into our country, right?\u201d \u201cI just turned my head to show the chart and something raps me,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd it sounds like a giant, like the world\u2019s largest mosquito. And, uh, it was. It was a bullet.\u201d CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno and Alayna Treene contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-vaccine-skepticism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_who-is-usha-vance", "text": "JD Vance has had several introductions to the American people: as the author of a memoir on what ails the White working class, as a newly elected Republican senator in his home state of Ohio and, on Monday, as his party\u2019s nominee for vice president. His wife, Usha, has been by his side through it all. As the Ohio delegation chanted her husband\u2019s name on the Republican convention floor in Milwaukee, Usha Vance stood beside the first-term senator and applauded as he was nominated by voice vote to be Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Weeks earlier, the trial lawyer and former judicial clerk admitted she wasn\u2019t \u201craring\u201d to completely upend the life she and her husband had built together or to face the attention that would follow. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone is ever ready for that kind of scrutiny,\u201d she told Fox News last month during a joint interview with the senator at their home in Ohio. \u201cI think we found the first campaign that he embarked on to be a shock. It was so different from anything we\u2019d ever done before. But it was an adventure.\u201d She added that she was open to seeing how things unfolded. Now, with JD Vance as Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee, the couple has embarked on a journey even bigger than the 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio. Trump\u2019s selection of the senator, who is nearly half his age and has three young children with his wife, has infused the ticket with a burst of youthfulness that could be a benefit during a cycle defined by the advanced age of the two major-party nominees. But the senator, who has only been in office since January 2023, is likely to face questions over both his lack of political experience and his transition from 2016 Trump critic to heir to the MAGA movement. If his 2022 Senate campaign is any indication, Usha Vance may play an understated but key role in helping introduce him to the public. \u201cSometimes people say that he\u2019s changed a lot, but the truth is I\u2019ve known him now for so many years, and he\u2019s always been so true to himself,\u201d she told Newsmax during a 2022 interview with her husband. For years, the senator has described his wife as a key part of his success, dating back to when the two attended law school together at Yale University, where Usha Vance also graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor\u2019s degree. In his 2016 memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d JD Vance described her as his \u201cYale spirit guide,\u201d helping him navigate life at the elite university where they met. \u201cShe instinctively understood the questions I didn\u2019t even know to ask, and she always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn\u2019t know existed,\u201d he wrote. The two were married in an interfaith ceremony in Kentucky in 2014 \u2013 Usha Vance\u2019s family is Hindu, while her husband converted to Catholicism in 2019. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Usha Chilukuri grew up in a suburb of San Diego. After college \u2013 two stints at Yale and a masters of philosophy at the University of Cambridge \u2013 she has clerked for two Supreme Court justices \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh when he served on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Chief Justice John Roberts. In 2015, she started as an associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, DC. She continued working at the firm between clerkships, where \u2013 according to an archived version of her employee biography \u2013 she handled \u201ccomplex civil litigation and appeals\u201d in sectors that included \u201chigher education, local government, entertainment, and technology, including semiconductors.\u201d The firm announced Monday that she had resigned. \u201cUsha has informed us she has decided to leave the firm,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cUsha has been an excellent lawyer and colleague, and we thank her for her years of work and wish her the best in her future career.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/who-is-usha-vance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this. You know what I mean?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/wisconsin-voters-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_trump-return-rnc-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump has gone from an insurrection to a resurrection. The searing picture of a nation in dystopian decline that defines the ex-president\u2019s politics was largely missing on the first night of the Republican National Convention. In its place was a sense of the divine \u2014 a pulsating belief in miracles among thousands of Republican delegates and a feeling that God spared their hero after he was nearly killed in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Thousands of Trump supporters in Milwaukee on Monday night hailed their leader, elevating him from MAGA superhero to saint-like status. Trump, a white bandage over his wounded right ear, stood below the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks NBA arena, like a heavyweight boxer waiting to climb into the ring in a title fight. The crowd cheered as his face suddenly appeared on a giant screen. Then he walked deliberately into the spotlight \u2014 raising his fist, in an electric political moment before slowly ascending to the VIP box to greet his new vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Trump didn\u2019t speak to the crowd, but mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d over and over again. Usually, Trump\u2019s face projects anger or rage or sarcasm. But on Monday night, it wore unusual emotion. It looked as if tears welled in Trump\u2019s eyes. A man who normally projects strength and seeks to dominant every room he enters betrayed a trace of wistfulness and vulnerability, as might befit someone coming to terms with their life being saved by a stroke of luck and a turn of the head. \u2018The devil \u2026 holding a rifle\u2019 Trump\u2019s supporters have long seen him as a God-like figure and his own campaign has played into the trope with advertising. He\u2019s styled himself as the secular prophet who leads a populist movement. For Trump\u2019s millions of American fans, Monday night was a validation of their faith in God and the ex-president and the righteousness of his mission. \u201cOn Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back on his feet and he roared!\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who reached for a preacher\u2019s cadence and was among many speakers who argued that Providence had saved Trump so he could save America. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem also sanctified the ex-president following his brush with death. \u201cWe already knew that President Donald Trump is fighter. He is the toughest man that I have ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody has endured more than what he has gone through. They\u2019ve attacked his reputation, they impeached him, they tried to bankrupt him, and they unjustly prosecuted him. But even in the most perilous moment this week, his instinct was to stand and to fight.\u201d Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 one of the rare speakers who broke from the unity message \u2013 said,\u00a0\u201cI thank God that his hand was on President Trump.\u201d The ex-president\u2019s escape spared the country another of the unfathomable political tragedies that have scared its history. Two pictures of Trump But where some voters see Trump as a messiah-like figure, others see a cult. Where some see inspiration, others sense demagoguery. And the veneration of Trump as a sort-of quasi-religious figure will cause deep fear given that he has made no secret of his authoritarian streak and a desire for retribution against his enemies if he wins a second term. That threat has taken on new relevance in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling that expanded presidential immunity. This unbridgeable national estrangement over the 45th president encapsulates the political divide that is deepening in America, which means calls for unity and a cooling of political rhetoric, while welcome, are unlikely to be sustained in the long term. After all, Trump\u2019s triumphant appearance on the day the Republican convention made him its nominee marked the official embrace of a figure who tried to destroy American democracy to stay in office after losing the 2020 election. This was the same man who summoned a mob to Washington on January 6, 2021, and told supporters to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d before they invaded the US Capitol, beat up police and tried to thwart the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. These jarring and dueling perspectives toward Trump are one reason why it will be hard for many Americans to buy into Trump\u2019s assurance about he\u2019d now try to heal a polarized nation. The former president insisted in an interview with the Washington Examiner on Sunday that his perspective had changed after he survived the shooting, implying that he\u2019d desist from using a political technique that relies on tearing at societal, cultural and racial divides. \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together.\u201d Multiple times during his administration,\u00a0pundits declared at a moment of national emergency that Trump had changed and \u201cpivoted\u201d to being presidential. But the ex-president did as much as anyone to foment the toxic political culture that is more intense now than at any time since the 1960s and which many political leaders blame for Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt and other political violence. Until he proves otherwise, voters might give the ex-president a hearing for any tempered tone given the horror of what unfolded in Pennsylvania, when Trump survived but a rally goer \u2014 father, fisherman and fireman Corey Comperatore \u2014 was killed while shielding his family. Old habits die hard Almost every Republican speaker got the memo Monday \u2014 that instead of Trump\u2019s normal characterization of a nation under siege from rampant crime, invading migrants and far left ideology, the prime-time picture was one of unity and inclusion. A list of Black Republican and female Republican lawmakers gave speeches, offering a somewhat misleading perception that the GOP has a deep and diverse bench. One GOP source said speechwriters at the convention had thrown out all their pre-written material for the week\u2019s top speakers and started again. Only Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson struck a discordant note as his old speech was loaded into the teleprompter and he went on a tear about how \u201ctoday\u2019s Democrat agenda, their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, to our values and our people.\u201d But there were earlier signs that the new sunny face of Trump\u2019s post-assassination GOP went only so far. The president\u2019s selection of Vance elevated one of the most fervent proponents of MAGA rhetoric. The Ohio senator responded in the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s shooting with one of the most discordant statements at a time when politicians on all sides were trying to calm a traumatized nation. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance wrote on X. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d The assassination attempt aside, Trump came into the convention on a roll, leading in most of the polls, well positioned in battleground state and profiting from the aftermath of Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance last month. He got another monumental win on Monday when Florida Judge Aileen Cannon threw out special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s classified documents case in a move that cemented the emerging reality that the ex-president may never be held accountable for his multiple alleged transgressions against the rule of law, apart from in his conviction in his hush money trial in New York. The reaction of Trump and his allies was just as misleading, angry and injurious to vital democratic institutions of accountability as it has always been. \u201cAs we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts \u2014 The January 6th Hoax in Washington, D.C., \u2026\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cThe Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, ME.\u201d New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of Trump\u2019s top supporters on Capitol Hill, accused the Justice Department of trying to \u201cshred the Constitution.\u201d The rhetoric was a sign from some corners of the GOP that national unity is possible only if Trump is handed the right to rule in an unfettered manner shielded from any criminal consequences for his actions. So, while Trump is promising change and a new tone, some old habits die hard. The ex-president has a new chance at politics and life in the wake of his assassination attempt. This week will begin to show how he uses it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/trump-return-rnc-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_joe-biden-dnc-process", "text": "A growing faction of House Democrats, convinced that President Joe Biden is too politically damaged to defeat Donald Trump in November, is calling on the Democratic National Committee to ditch plans to virtually nominate Biden in the coming weeks \u2013 setting up an extraordinary intraparty clash against Biden allies who are staging a quiet pressure campaign to accelerate the president\u2019s formal nomination. Democrats\u00a0have been planning for weeks to conclude\u00a0Biden\u2019s nomination process\u00a0before August 7 \u2013 well before the Chicago convention next\u00a0month.\u00a0But Rep. Jared Huffman, a progressive Democrat from California, told CNN on Tuesday that there is a \u201cgrowing number of members\u201d concerned about the virtual roll call vote, calling it a \u201cterrible idea\u201d and a \u201cdumb thing.\u201d \u201cIf the election were held today, he would get crushed,\u201d Huffman said of Biden. \u201cWe have got to do something about it.\u201d CNN has also learned from multiple sources of a draft letter circulating among House Democrats calling on the party to slow down the process \u2013 a clear sign of the party\u2019s deep worries about Biden remaining at the top of their ticket. The public and private airing of concerns come amid a push among some Biden allies to kick off Biden\u2019s virtual roll call process as quickly as possible,\u00a0according to six\u00a0Democratic officials familiar with the\u00a0discussions.\u00a0Two key Democratic committees\u00a0have long been set to gather this coming Friday and Sunday\u00a0to discuss\u00a0the exact timeline for delegates across the\u00a0country to start casting their votes. The earliest that voting could begin would be after the second meeting on Sunday. If voting were to begin Sunday or soon thereafter, that would mark an aggressive\u00a0timeline\u00a0\u2013 and the idea is already drawing\u00a0fresh scrutiny from other Democrats eager for Biden to acknowledge his challenges and step aside. \u201cThe disbelief that they\u2019d expedite the nomination is as widespread as the recognition the DNC is leading Democrats into a house fire with water bottles,\u201d one House Democrat said. The DNC virtual roll call\u00a0process was initially\u00a0put in place for the party to step around an issue in Ohio that threatened to leave Biden off the ballot in that state. Lawmakers in Ohio have since passed a law to make that issue moot, but the DNC has pointed to the potential of a legal challenge by Ohio Republicans for moving forward with the virtual roll call anyway. For Democrats who are afraid Biden will lose to Trump and take the Democratic ticket down with him, time is running out to make their case to the president, his family and a remarkably tight circle of advisers. But even as those entreaties are being made daily behind the scenes, plans are being made to solidify his standing with the help of party rules in the Democratic convention process. Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison pushed back on\u00a0any suggestion that attempts might be underway within the DNC\u00a0to accelerate the virtual roll call. \u201cThe timeline for the virtual roll call process remains on schedule and unchanged from when the DNC made that decision in May,\u201d Harrison said in a statement,\u00a0but did not elaborate on when he expects the roll call to begin. CNN has also reached out to the Biden campaign about the effort. An intraparty fight The fiery discussions have opened a\u00a0potentially messy and unseemly collision among different quarters of the Democratic Party that is playing out even as Republicans are rallying around their new ticket this week at the GOP convention in Milwaukee. While a formal timetable has yet to be set, any appearance of party leaders stepping on the gas to push Biden\u2019s nomination forward in the most expeditious way is sure to spark\u00a0more anger \u2013 and a possible rebellion \u2013 given the grave concerns across the party about whether Biden should remain atop the Democratic ticket. Among the party\u2019s advocates of holding an early roll call,\u00a0intense discussion continues over what the rules allow and how the party should proceed \u2013 whether lawmakers, donors, and prominent surrogates should be given more time to coalesce around their candidate, or whether the party should press ahead with an early nomination to avoid \u201ca sh*tshow in August,\u201d according to one source involved. Amid the growing uproar over, three former heads of the DNC have weighed in to back the process, calling it the \u201cwisest course.\u201d The letter, sent to members of the DNC\u2019s Rules Committee on Tuesday and penned by former DNC chairs Donna Brazile, Howard Dean and Terry McAuliffe and obtained by CNN, says: \u201cWe believe that a virtual process\u2014before the in-person Convention begins in Chicago on August 19, 2024\u2014is necessary to ensure that the Democratic nominees for President and Vice President appear on the ballot in every state and in the District of Columbia without basis for legal challenge.\u201d The three ex-chairs go on to say that \u201ca different approach risks disenfranchising millions of voters and clouding the Democratic path to victory.\u201d Notably, Brazile, Dean and McAuliffe said that the virtual roll call \u201cneed not be immediate\u201d \u2013 but should finish before August 7 to not run into any potential legal issues related to Biden\u2019s ability to get on the ballot in Ohio. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt on Monday, Biden \u2013\u00a0asked whether he felt he had weathered the political storm following his disastrous debate performance last month \u2013 pointed to the primary voters who supported him. \u201cFourteen\u00a0million\u00a0people\u00a0voted for me to be the nominee in the Democratic Party. Okay? I listen to them,\u201d he said. Questions about whether Biden should continue seeking a second term that began to intensify after the June 27 CNN debate has shined a bright spotlight on the virtual roll call process \u2013 a process that prior to last month had drawn relatively scant attention. Now, with Biden\u2019s political future up in the air, there is confusion and concern among some delegates about the Ohio law that prompted the DNC to move forward with a roll call before the Chicago convention in the first place. In the wake of Biden\u2019s halting debate performance, some Democrats discussed potentially delaying or canceling the July 21 meeting to allow the agitation to run its course. But the DNC proceeding with the original plan in the face of recent events has piqued frustration across the Democratic Party, from lawmakers who want Biden to reconsider his candidacy to delegates who want to cast their vote in\u00a0person, according to three sources with knowledge of the situation. Meanwhile, some influential Democrats with close ties to the White House have publicly pinned the official start of the mid-August party convention as the deadline for Biden to decide whether he will proceed with his candidacy. \u201cIf he decides to change his mind later on, then we would respond to that,\u201d Rep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, said in a television interview last week. \u201cWe have until the 19th of August to open our convention.\u201d Some House Democrats want to slow the process down A draft letter circulating among Democratic House members and other delegates is calling on the party to slow down the process, multiple sources told CNN. \u201cThere is no legal justification for this extraordinary and unprecedented action which would effectively accelerate the nomination process by nearly a month,\u201d the letter reads. Behind the scenes,\u00a0Democrats backing an early conclusion\u00a0have floated the possibility that Sen. JD Vance, now officially nominated as Trump\u2019s running mate and Republicans\u2019 effective number two, could press for new challenges to Biden\u2019s ballot access in his home state, a notion state officials roundly deny. \u201cThe issue is resolved in Ohio, and Democrat proxies know that and should stop trying to scapegoat Ohio for their own party\u2019s disfunction,\u201d Ben\u00a0Kindel, press secretary for Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose, tells CNN. The letter drafted by Huffman \u2013 who confirmed its authenticity and said it was unclear when they planned to send it out \u2013 agrees the issue is resolved. \u201cAt this point there is no serious threat to the Democratic ticket nominated in regular order at next month\u2019s DNC convention appearing on the ballot in Ohio or any other state,\u201d\u00a0the letter reads. While the draft language is likely to change, it sets out the concerns in the party about moving forward with the nomination process while debate about Biden\u2019s future is ongoing. \u201cThe Democratic Party \u2013 not just elected officials and delegate, but also millions of grassroots voters \u2013 is currently engaged in careful consideration and debate about the absolute imperative of defeating Donald Trump and winning control of Congress,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAs Democratic members of Congress, we represent the spectrum of views on this question. Some of us have called on President Biden to step aside, others have urged him to stay in the race, and still others have deep concerns about the status of the President\u2019s campaign but have yet to take a position on what should happen.\u201d \u201cAll of us, however agree that stifling debate and prematurely shutting down any possible change in the Democratic ticket through an unnecessary and unprecedented \u2018virtual rollcall\u2019 in the days ahead is a terrible idea. It could deeply undermine the morale and unity of Democrats- from delegates, volunteers, grassroots organizers and donors to ordinary voters \u2013 at the worst possible time.\u201d \u2018We are hearing denial\u2019 In a phone interview on Tuesday, Huffman said the members \u201ccover the entire spectrum of our caucus\u201d and that there would be a \u201cpretty big\u201d backlash if the DNC moves ahead with the plans. Noting there\u2019s a \u201cmajor enthusiasm gap\u201d between Trump and Biden, Huffman said: \u201cYou don\u2019t achieve energy and enthusiasm by brute force,\u201d referring to moving up the roll call vote to officially nominate Biden. Huffman said he is not yet calling on Biden to be replaced but wants to give the president more time to instill Democrats with\u00a0confidence in his campaign. It would be much harder to replace Biden once he\u2019s formally the nominee. \u201cWe are hearing denial and an attempt to shut down the discussion,\u201d Huffman said. In a recent press conference, Biden was asked whether party delegates would be free to vote for an alternative candidate at the convention if they desired. \u201cThat\u2019s the democratic process,\u201d Biden said of the ability of delegates to change their mind, before adding confidently: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_republican-senate-candidates-rnc-convention", "text": "The excitement at the Republican National Convention isn\u2019t just about Donald Trump and his new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance \u2013 it also extends to Senate candidates who the party believes can help deliver the former president a GOP majority on Capitol Hill. While Democrats in competitive Senate races have largely been overperforming President Joe Biden in polling so far this year, Republicans are hopeful that that movement in favor of Trump at the top of the ticket will close those gaps and potentially expand this year\u2019s playing field. That\u2019s reflected in the roster of candidates speaking Tuesday night, which includes Hung Cao, the GOP Senate nominee in Virginia, a state Biden won by 10 points in 2020. Besides Virginia \u2013 which New York Times/Siena College polling out this week showed to be a margin-of-error presidential race \u2013 Republicans are also eyeing the Senate race in New Mexico, a state Biden carried by 11 points. Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, specifically touted New Mexico GOP nominee Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Sen. Pete Domenici, at a CNN-Politico Grill event in Milwaukee on Monday. Polling conducted by the NRSC and Domenici\u2019s campaign last month showed her in a margin-of-error race with Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich. Democrats, however, don\u2019t see trouble signs for their incumbents in those states. \u201cWhile Democrats are taking nothing for granted, New Mexico and Virginia have elected Democrats to the US Senate for over a decade and will do so again this cycle,\u201d said a national Democrat working on Senate races. Republicans need to pick up just one or two seats to flip the Senate, depending on who wins the White House. And with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin retiring from deep-red West Virginia, they\u2019re likely to get at least one of those. The top three seats on CNN\u2019s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip have consistently been in states Trump twice won comfortably, followed by presidential battlegrounds. Maryland, which backed Biden by more than 30 points, joined the list of GOP targets after former two-term Gov. Larry Hogan entered the race. But the popular Republican, who has made clear he isn\u2019t supporting Trump despite having the former president\u2019s support, will unsurprisingly not be onstage Tuesday night. Election observers don\u2019t see improving numbers for Trump drastically changing a map that already favored his party. \u201cIt expands the map for Republicans at the very margin of the battlefield. But the status quo was already a pretty expansive list of opportunities for Republicans,\u201d Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, told CNN, arguing that New Mexico is a more realistic takeover opportunity for Senate Republicans than Virginia. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s conviction Tuesday in his federal corruption trial \u2013 and his colleagues\u2019 calls for him to step down \u2013 has put a fresh spotlight on New Jersey, where Democratic Rep. Andy Kim has a strong path to election in a state that backed Biden by 16 points in 2020. There\u2019s still the possibility Menendez could run as an independent and split the Democratic vote, but Rubashkin doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a big threat to Democrats. \u201cThe reality was that (Menendez) was so unpopular in the state by the time the verdict came down that any support he would have gotten would not have complicated Andy Kim\u2019s path in a major way,\u201d he said. While the Senate landscape unquestionably benefits Republicans, some of the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents have leaned on strong brands in their states and fundraising advantages to create separation from Biden. Republicans recruited a large crop of wealthy candidates, many of them businessmen, to run this year. But that hasn\u2019t yet closed Democrats\u2019 fundraising edge, and it\u2019s fueled Democratic attacks on the Republican candidate\u2019s business ties and out-of-state connections. Daines argued on Monday that polling from this spring and early summer won\u2019t reflect what happens in November, suggesting that lower-propensity voters who support Trump will turn out this year in a way they did not during the 2022 midterms. Daines said the NRSC halted its polling on Saturday after the assassination attempt on Trump to let things \u201ccool off a bit.\u201d And there\u2019s been limited public polling \u2013 especially of Senate races \u2013 since last month\u2019s presidential debate. Since the debate, some GOP Senate candidates have run ads questioning Biden\u2019s mental fitness for office, trying to pressure Democratic incumbents into answering whether he\u2019s fit to serve. But Daines said this week that the president\u2019s policies, rather than his acuity, should be the focus. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to talk about President Biden\u2019s mental acuity,\u201d Daines told Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade during the CNN-Politico Grill interview, reflecting the shift in Republican messaging that was largely seen onstage Monday during night one of the RNC. Candidates onstage Tuesday night will include those in the GOP\u2019s top targeted races. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat, is almost certain to flip the strong Trump state. In Montana, businessman Tim Sheehy is taking on Sen. Jon Tester, the most vulnerable Senate incumbent running for reelection. Ohio businessman Bernie Moreno, whom Democrats boosted in the GOP primary because they thought he\u2019d be the weakest challenger, is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, a progressive populist who has so far been able to defy the reddening of his home state. Candidates running in key battlegrounds will also be on hand. Army veteran Sam Brown is taking on first-term Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen in Nevada \u2013 a state where demographics are moving away from Democrats. Another veteran, Pennsylvania\u2019s Dave McCormick, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP Senate nod in 2022, is taking on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. In Michigan\u2019s open Senate race, national Republicans and Trump are backing former House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers to take on Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the likely Democratic nominee after next month\u2019s primaries. And in the convention\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, Republicans have rallied around businessman Eric Hovde to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. In Arizona\u2019s open Senate race, Kari Lake is all but certain to win next month\u2019s GOP primary, but her refusal to accept her 2022 gubernatorial loss and her repetition of Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies has given some Republicans pause. She\u2019ll be facing Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in a state Biden flipped in 2020 but that looks unlikely to go blue again this year. Tuesday\u2019s speakers also include Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who\u2019s seeking an open seat in a solidly red state, and Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who is one of Democrats\u2019 few targets this year but running in a red-trending state. Scott, who\u2019s making a bid to succeed Mitch McConnell as Senate GOP leader, is expected to face former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/republican-senate-candidates-rnc-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_trump-vp-pick-jd-vance", "text": "Donald Trump has named US Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, further elevating the Ohio Republican who has adopted the former president\u2019s populist agenda after years of pointed criticism of Trump. \u201cAfter lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Trump\u2019s selection came on the first day of the Republican National Convention and just two days after he survived an assassination attempt at his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, over the weekend. On the floor of the convention, shortly after news of Vance\u2019s selection broke, delegates celebrating the party\u2019s ticket were writing Vance\u2019s name onto Trump signs using markers. Trump called Vance on Monday, to officially offer him the spot 20 minutes before the former president made the announcement on Truth Social,\u00a0a source familiar with the process told CNN. The two had met at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, before the rally at which Trump was shot in the ear. Ahead of Trump\u2019s selection of Vance, the Ohio senator\u2019s supporters, including Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and conservative media figure Tucker Carlson, had argued that Vance has the strongest relationship with Trump of a group of finalists that also included Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and would be the most loyal selection, multiple sources familiar with the discussions said. They made the case that Vance can appeal to working-class voters viewed as essential to winning the key battleground states in November, given his upbringing in a poor Rust Belt town in Ohio. They also pointed to his wife, Usha Chilukuri \u2014 the child of Indian immigrants \u2014 as being someone who could appeal to minority voters, the sources said. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, on the convention floor, described Trump\u2019s selection of Vance as \u201ca great day for Ohio.\u201d \u201cHe is consistent with Trump\u2019s appeal to working men and women,\u201d DeWine said, adding that he thought it was wise for Trump to pick someone younger. \u201cAlso, someone who shares his desire to expand the base of the Republican Party.\u201d A turnaround on Trump Vance, a venture capitalist and the author of the best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d was elected to the Senate in 2022 after receiving a boost from Trump in a contentious Republican primary. It was a reversal from just six years earlier. Vance was a key voice in the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement during the 2016 election and has a well-documented history of opposing the former president publicly. CNN previously reported that Vance liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in a Hillary Clinton administration. But he earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in the 2022 Ohio Republican Senate primary after a concerted yearlong effort by Vance to embrace a new image as a leading MAGA proponent, courting the former president at meetings in Mar-a-Lago and through appearances on Fox News. In a display of loyalty, Vance was one of several potential running mates and Republican lawmakers to stand by Trump\u2019s side at a New York courthouse during his criminal hush money trial. He\u2019s also made clear that his view of the constitutional limits on a vice president\u2019s role in certifying election results differs from that of former Vice President Mike Pence, who drew the ire of Trump in January 2021, when he opted not to interfere in the process of approving electoral votes for Joe Biden. Vance told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in May that he was \u201cextremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger,\u201d even though some members of the pro-Trump mob that broke into the US Capitol were calling for Pence to be hanged. In a separate May interview on CNN, Vance said he would commit to accepting the 2024 election results \u201cif it\u2019s a free and fair election.\u201d \u201cIf you think there were problems, you have to be willing to pursue those problems and try to prosecute your case. And certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I\u2019ll accept the results,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in the 2020 election. Vance\u2019s persona has endeared him to the right wing of the Republican Party, including Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., who has hosted the Ohio Republican on his podcast and praised him publicly. In Congress, Vance has been a vocal opponent of foreign aid, opposing legislation to send more aid from the US to Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s war. In addition to his MAGA credentials, Vance also brings ties to traditionally liberal-leaning Silicon Valley to the presidential ticket. He recently helped organize a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco hosted by prominent tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya. Democrats pounce on Trump\u2019s pick President Joe Biden, weighing in on Trump\u2019s running mate selection for the first time late Monday afternoon, described Vance as a \u201cclone\u201d of Trump on policy matters. \u201cHe\u2019s a clone of Trump on the issues,\u201d Biden said before boarding Air Force One. \u201cA clone of Trump on the issues, so I don\u2019t see any difference.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign cast\u00a0Vance as a Trump enabler in the moments after he was announced as the vice presidential pick. \u201cVance will do what Mike Pence wouldn\u2019t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,\u201d Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement. She described Vance as \u201cone of the most far-right extremists in Washington,\u201d pointing to previous endorsements and his friendship with \u00a0firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia. Biden\u2019s campaign also invoked Vance\u2019s previous criticism of Trump in a fundraising appeal emailed to supporters Monday afternoon. \u201cHow does a guy who used to say that Donald Trump and his policies were \u2018reprehensible,\u2019 become Donald Trump\u2019s running mate? Through years of being a rubber-stamp for Donald Trump\u2019s extreme, MAGA agenda. You might even say he\u2019s the poster child for Project 2025,\u201d the appeal said. Democrats immediately signaled that they plan to highlight Vance\u2019s previous comments on abortion, which have gone farther than Trump in pushing for national restrictions. A day after Ohio voters approved a ballot measure to protect access to abortion last year, Vance urged Republicans to embrace a federal ban on abortion to more effectively make the case to voters about the GOP\u2019s position. In November 2023, Vance told CNN that Republicans need to focus on \u201cpersuasion\u201d to sway voters towards their position, while arguing the GOP needs to press for a national standard banning abortion \u2014 either at 15 or 20 weeks \u2014 with some exceptions. \u201cIt seems to suggest there needs to be some more interest in this building among Republicans in setting some sort of minimum national standard, whether that\u2019s it\u2019s 15 weeks or 20 weeks or the different ranges that are thrown out there,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Ted Barrett in the Capitol. \u201cWe keep giving into the idea that the federal Congress has no role in this matter. Because if it doesn\u2019t it, then the pro-life movement is basically not gonna exist, I think, for the next couple of years.\u201d While Vance said he expected most states to adopt their own bans, \u201cthere\u2019s some reason I think we should have some minimum national standard.\u201d Vance added: \u201cI think that a majority of Americans would support a 15-week pain capable ban, assuming you had the exceptions, but then you\u2019re still gonna have the gross majority of abortion policy banned at the state level. And I think that\u2019s probably the kind of compromise we need to think about.\u201d Abortion could be a key issue if Vance and Vice President Kamala Harris meet for a debate. Harris called Vance on Monday \u2014 but did not reach him and left a voicemail, a Biden campaign official said. She congratulated him on his selection, welcomed him to the race and express her hope that the two can meet in the vice-presidential debate proposed by CBS News. Vance didn\u2019t answer Harris\u2019 phone call because it came from an unknown number, and he was unable to call back. Staff for Vance\u2019s team was in touch with Harris\u2019 team and working on setting up a call Monday night, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters", "text": "Which one of these candidates is facing calls from members of their own party to step aside in the presidential race: \u25ba Is it the recently convicted felon, also indicted for election interference and mishandling classified documents, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation as well as lying about his net worth to get loans tied to his massive real estate portfolio? \u25ba Or is it the incumbent president with a recent record of accomplishment in a bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a dubiously named piece of legislation that nonetheless addressed many of his party\u2019s priorities, like climate change? Both men are well into retirement age. Both ramble through answers to questions when they bother to take them. Both mix up names. Neither took part in debates during a primary season in which they racked up wins. And yet one of the men, former President Donald Trump, 78, has been able to remake the Republican Party around his own divisive persona. The other, President Joe Biden, 81, has now spent weeks defiantly defending his fitness for the job, slowly emerging from a protective bubble at the White House after a disastrous debate and spotty subsequent interviews. The next week will offer a fresh look at what must feel like a cruel dichotomy to Biden supporters. The GOP is now built around Trump When the Republican National Convention gets underway Monday, it will show off a speaking schedule full of far right personalities and an official party platform rewritten and simplified around Trump\u2019s priorities. Trump, between now and then, will pick a vice president from a short list of people who have previously criticized him but are now all in. In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination with insults about the size of Trump\u2019s hands, calling him a con man and arguing he couldn\u2019t be trusted with nuclear codes. Now Rubio is a Trump convert. So is Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who went from never-Trumper to true believer. Some Democrats are moving in an opposite direction. Longtime supporters now want Biden out of the race for fear he can\u2019t beat Trump, which\u00a0is\u00a0the one and only goal of Democrats afraid of his return to the White House. In any event, Rubio and Vance, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who are also reportedly on Trump\u2019s vice presidential short list, should be wary. His previous vice president, Mike Pence, is among the many people who served in Trump\u2019s first White House who have not endorsed Trump\u2019s latest election bid after an angry mob, inspired by Trump, stormed the Capitol with chants of \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Republicans had the opportunity to go a different direction. A CNN poll released back in February, before Trump had sealed the Republican presidential nomination, suggested his top Republican rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would fare much better in a head-to-head contest with Biden. Republican primary voters doubled down, decisively, on Trump. One of Haley\u2019s major policy proposals was a test for for older candidates like Biden and Trump, a prescient idea since Biden is now facing calls that he take a cognitive test and Trump has bragged that he could easily pass one. Still trying to convince fellow Democrats While Trump eyes a convention to celebrate his dominance next week, Biden is fighting back the argument that Democratic convention delegates should pick a younger successor next month. The latest in a series of public tests of Biden\u2019s abilities will be another interview with a network news anchor, NBC this time, broadcast in prime time on Monday. It\u2019s late in the election cycle for Democrats to be having this conversation, since the primary season has ended, their convention takes place next month and Trump is currently thought to have an advantage in key states heading into the November election. There are some indications Biden is regaining some support among key Democrats. While over a dozen lawmakers have called on him to drop out, with the number continuing to rise Friday, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime ally, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that the conversation about Biden\u2019s fitness needs to end before it hurts the party. \u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 with Biden,\u201d Clyburn said. If Biden dropped out, Clyburn said he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Progressives lawmakers, people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent \u2013 not Biden\u2019s natural allies on the policy front \u2013 are also standing up for Biden, arguing the party should rally around him and mobilize for November. Biden, meanwhile, despite the majority of polling that suggests he trails Trump in key states likely to decide the election, said at a rare news conference Thursday that he hasn\u2019t been shown polling data that suggests he would lose in November. The fact that he said polling data could theoretically convince him to leave the race is an adjustment from last week, when he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d could sway him. A bridge no more Biden also said at the news conference that he had changed his mind about a 2020 pledge to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between his older generation of lawmakers and and a new generation of leaders. \u201cWhat I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom and know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\u201d he said. Convinced he can beat Trump Biden also clearly believes that he is still the best person to beat Trump \u2013 the motivating principle for any Democrat these days \u2013 and Biden has been shocked during his presidency at the staying power of Trump and the MAGA turn of the GOP. \u201cHe thought it would be in the rearview mirror by now,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a recent book about Biden\u2019s presidency, \u201cThe Fight of His Life,\u201d speaking to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was necessarily planning to be a two-term president, but now that Trump is the alternative, Joe Biden really believes in his bones that he\u2019s the guy to beat him,\u201d Whipple said. In an odd twist, then, the thing keeping Biden in the race may be the very thing that has caused other Democrats to call for him to drop out.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Thomas Matthew Crooks told his coworkers he would be back to work on Sunday. While investigators have not been able to identify a motive for Crooks\u2019 attack at the rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, they are piecing together more of his activities. By 3 p.m. on Saturday, roughly three hours before the shooting, Crooks was at the security screening area for the rally. He first aroused suspicion when he passed through the magnetometers carrying a\u00a0rangefinder, which looks similar to a small pair of binoculars and is used by hunters and target shooters to measure distances when setting up a long-range shot, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The rangefinder would not have prevented Crooks from getting through the security screening point, but it did attract the attention of security personnel who kept an eye on him until he left the secure area. Investigators are unsure of where Crooks went after he left the screening area but the working theory is that he went to his car to retrieve the rifle. Around the same time witnesses alerted police that Crooks was crawling on the roof of the American Glass Research building, one of the four counter-sniper teams observed Crooks looking at their position through the rangefinder, according to the senior law enforcement official. \u201cThey were looking at him while he was looking at them,\u201d the official said. Crooks gained access to the rooftop by climbing on top of the building\u2019s air conditioning system and hoisting himself up, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. After the shooting, multiple law enforcement sources said investigators found a bulletproof vest, three fully-loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled explosive devices in Crooks\u2019 car. Investigators are uncertain as to whether Crooks had a plan to use the body armor, nearly 100 rounds of additional ammunition from those loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled bombs, had he escaped after the shooting. Additionally, after a search of his residence, investigators discovered another bulletproof vest, another remote-controlled explosive device, and a 3D printer, according to multiple law enforcement sources. In the last several months, Crooks received multiple packages, including some marked as possibly containing hazardous materials, according to a joint FBI and Department of Homeland Security bulletin obtained by CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_2024-campaign-transformed-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump will reemerge after an attempted assassination as an even greater mythical hero of his MAGA movement with the Republican National Convention opening Monday after an extraordinary two weeks that have transformed the 2024 campaign. More than 24 hours on, the horror of Saturday\u2019s shooting is only beginning to distill into a shocking new national trauma. But both the former president and President Joe Biden are gaming out how to navigate the political aftershocks. And there was another stunning development on Monday morning, when a district judge in Florida threw out special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s case regarding Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The shock move swept away one of the four criminal cases hanging over the ex-president in a huge victory for his campaign as the convention opens. It cements the notion that, apart from his hush money conviction in New York, he will not face legal accountability before November\u2019s election. The latest twist in Trump\u2019s legal dramas came as the country was still processing the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s horrific events. An assassination attempt against a presidential candidate, with all the historical allusions it evokes, raises fears that bloodshed will beget more bloodshed as the toxic politics of the last decade threaten to take an even more ominous turn. \u201cA former president was shot, an American citizen killed while simply exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot \u2014 must not \u2014 go down this road in America,\u201d Biden said, calling for calm and for a polarized nation to unite in an address from the Oval Office on Sunday night. The president mourned Corey Comperatore, a firefighter and father, who died at the Trump rally shielding his family and joined the haunting roll of Americans lost to political violence. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, joined calls for restraint, telling CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s a dark time in the history of the country. This is a dangerous time. And we\u2019ve been suggesting that all elected officials, from the president on down, really try to draw the country together. We need a unified message. We need to turn the temperature down.\u201d In his first interview since the attempt on his life, the former president pledged that his RNC keynote address Thursday \u2014 which had been expected to be an update on his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address in 2017 \u2014 would be a \u201clot different.\u201d \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,\u201d Trump told Salena Zito of the Washington Examiner. An earth-shaking two weeks since the CNN presidential debate has rescripted a race that had, for all its quirks, been a relatively stable grind between two unpopular candidates, neither of whom the public really wanted. Trump will show up to a convention in front of many followers who already saw him in almost a divine, superhuman light, having escaped a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet, to claim his third straight GOP nomination. The weekend\u2019s terrible events will only reinforce his control over his party. And pollsters\u00a0will be\u00a0watching to see whether sympathy over what happened swells his already broadening lead in swing states. Biden, meanwhile, spent the last two weeks fighting to save his own nomination, after his debate debacle in Atlanta exposed the 81-year-old\u2019s struggles with age and unleashed panic among Democrats that he\u2019ll hand Trump the White House and the GOP a monopoly on Washington power. The uproar over the Trump assassination attempt may pause\u00a0the intraparty\u00a0rebellion against Biden for now, especially as he assumes his role as the leader of a nation\u00a0in sudden crisis. Only the oldest Americans lived through the political assassinations of the 1960s, and those who remember the attempt to kill President Ronald Reagan in 1981 are now middle-aged. So, millions of people, who have already endured political paroxysms of recent years, are now experiencing the consequent and frightening sense of a nation off its axis for the first time. But despite the shock of the last few days, politics will always fill a vacuum \u2014 especially after a political tragedy. Indeed, Trump\u2019s defiance \u2014 he was pictured with blood streaking his face and clenching his fist while Secret Service rushed him offstage Saturday \u2014 was a gesture that is likely to define his career and his life. \u201cA lot of people say it\u2019s the most iconic photo they\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump told The New York Post on Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re right, and I didn\u2019t die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture.\u201d It is too early to say how voters will respond to the deeply disturbing events at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, or the sitting president\u2019s pledge that he\u2019s fit to serve until January 2029 despite his performance at the debate. But the decisions that each man makes in the coming days and the tone they seek to strike will be critical to how the campaign evolves. One thing about the election likely won\u2019t change. In a nation that was already deeply divided, the core vote for both Trump and Biden was probably locked in. Tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states probably still hold the fate of the White House \u2014 and the nation\u2019s future in their hands. Trump\u2019s tactical choices The convention, taking place in the home arena of the Milwaukee Bucks in the critical battleground state of Wisconsin, will formally nominate Trump in the fabled roll call of the states. And the GOP is on alert for him to name his vice presidential pick, after a reality show-style process in which he\u2019s teased out potential ticket mates, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The ex-president told supporters on Truth Social on Sunday that he\u2019d been planning to delay his trip to Wisconsin by two days, \u201cbut have just decided that I cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.\u201d Trump has conducted his attempt to regain the White House as a campaign of personal and political vengeance amid his claims that his legal cases, including his conviction in a hush money trial in New York and two pending trials over his attempt to thwart the will of voters in 2020, are proof of political persecution. There can be no justification for an assassination attempt on a candidate \u2014 an assault on democracy. But if the attack on Saturday sprung from a fetid political culture, Trump has been an enthusiastic participant with rhetoric that often seemed to incite violence and that coarsened the public square. This included his racist conspiracy theories about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama and apparent mockery of the injuries suffered by Paul Pelosi, the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was attacked with a hammer inside his home. The ex-president\u2019s summoning of protesters to Washington on January 6, 2021, and his call for them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d preceded the assault on the US Capitol and the beating of police officers by his supporters. Trump faces a choice. He could interpret the assassination attempt as a catalyst for less poisoned rhetoric. This could be a politically astute move at a time when many Americans are feeling frightened. His past conduct, however, would mean many voters would struggle to believe him. The alternative course would be to fit the assassination attempt into his claims of personal persecution by an amorphous \u201cleft\u201d that is seeking to crush his political ambitions, end his freedom through the courts and even take his life. (The motivation of the lone gunman who took aim at Trump is so far unclear as the investigations continues.) If Trump reacts to the assault on his life by vowing vengeance, the current political crisis and moment of national upheaval could worsen considerably. Many Republican politicians issued calls for calm and an easing of political rhetoric after the shooting \u2014 as did Democrats. But some GOP lawmakers also seemed to be using their comments to try to shut down criticism of a former president who sought to overturn the 2020 election and who has vowed to seek \u201cretribution\u201d in a second term. Vance, for instance, wrote on X that \u201cthe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.\u201d He added: \u201cthat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d \u00a0The choice of Vance for Trump\u2019s running mate would therefore send an unmistakable message. And Johnson accompanied his calls for calm by implying that Democrats\u00a0\u2014 in advancing their arguments against Trump \u2014 had somehow abetted the assassination attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s objective truth that Donald Trump is probably the most persecuted and attacked political figure in history, certainly among presidents, maybe at least since Abraham Lincoln, Civil War era,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cThat takes a toll, \u2026 When my colleagues go out and say, \u2018Democracy will end, the republic will be in an emergency stage if Donald Trump wins for president,\u2019 it\u2019s just not true.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen they say that kind of rhetoric and they heat it up like that, there are people out there that take these things to heart and act upon them.\u201d Biden\u2019s new political challenge \u2014 and opening Biden now faces one of the most intricate tests of presidential dexterity for years. He is embracing his duty to protect political discourse \u2014 even that of an opponent \u2014 and has called for an investigation of apparent Secret Service failings in the attack. At the same time, he\u2019s trying to revive his own political fortunes by looking presidential, while still taking on Trump. Biden\u2019s flexing of the symbolic power of the office \u2014 and the spotlight on the Republican National Convention this week \u2014 may serve to blunt attention on Democratic anxieties about his prospects, although all it would take to revive public concerns would be more alarmingly shaky public performances. His Oval Office address, while moving, was marked by several of the verbal flubs that Trump has mercilessly mocked and that after the debate disaster have turned every public event into an excruciating examination of his capacity. Biden now faces the difficult decision about when to return to the offensive against Trump \u2014 one that may be conditioned by the tone his rival adopts. But he subtly signaled during his Oval Office address that he will not water down his warnings that his predecessor and possible successor represents a threat to democratic freedoms that define the soul of America. He did so by citing several events in which Trump, his supporters or far-right groups were involved \u2014 mentioning \u201cmembers of Congress of both parties being targeted and shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or \u2026 intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor (Michigan Democrat Gretchen Whitmer) or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever,\u201d Biden said. His sentiments are shared by many. But bitter experience suggests he may not be the last president to say so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/2024-campaign-transformed-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick Ohio Sen. JD Vance was once a fervent critic of the former president. In private messages, he wondered ahead of Trump\u2019s election whether he was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and in 2017 said the then-president\u00a0was a\u00a0\u201cmoral disaster.\u201d In public, he agreed Trump was a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d who didn\u2019t care about regular people and called him \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler,\u201d Vance wrote in a message to a friend\u00a0in 2016. \u201cHow\u2019s that for discouraging?\u201d In 2016 and 2017, Vance, then best-known for penning the best-selling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d said Trump was \u201ccultural heroin\u201d and \u201cjust another opioid\u201d\u00a0for Middle America. He told CNN ahead of the 2016 election that he was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d voting for Trump and he also contemplated voting for Hillary Clinton (he ultimately said he planned to vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin.) \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us,\u201d\u00a0he tweeted\u00a0after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape was published in 2016. Vance also\u00a0liked tweets\u00a0that said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a deleted-tweet. Trump\u2019s vice president announcement on Monday caps a dramatic reversal on Vance\u2019s part. He made his most critical remarks when he was promoting his memoir\u00a0\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0which was published in 2016. The book had catapulted him to fame as a \u201cTrump whisperer,\u201d capable of explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to the White working class. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna vote for Trump\u00a0because I think that he\u2019s projecting very complex problems onto simple villains,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper ahead of the 2016 election. But by 2020, Vance fully embraced Trump, telling podcaster Megyn Kelly after the election he voted for him. A year\u00a0later,\u00a0Vance announced he was running for Senate in Ohio and vied for Trump\u2019s endorsement, which he ultimately received. But at the beginning of that campaign, Vance was\u00a0forced to apologize\u00a0after CNN resurfaced old tweets from the 2016 campaign and early in 2017 in Trump\u2019s administration that he had deleted. \u201cI did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance told Fox News\u00a0in 2021.\u00a0 In a\u00a0statement to CNN last month, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d for changing his mind on\u00a0the former president. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Vance won his Senate race in 2022 by\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0\u2013 less than the\u00a08.1 percentage points Trump\u00a0won the state\u00a0by\u00a0in 2020. Vance\u2019s remarkable political evolution underscores the broader trend of realignment in the country and the GOP as the party becomes one of\u00a0working-class\u00a0White\u00a0voters. \u2018I\u00a0don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks\u2019 In comments promoting his book, Vance often said Trump played\u00a0to\u00a0or exploited\u00a0White\u00a0working-class\u00a0voters\u2019 fears and prejudices. \u201cAnd I cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud,\u201d\u00a0one radio host said\u00a0to Vance when promoting his book in 2016. \u201cI think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people.\u201d \u201cI do too. And it\u2019s like you, like you said, I, I agree with you on Trump because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored.\u201d In\u00a0September 2016, Vance argued Trump\u2019s immigration policies like the \u201cgreat Mexican Wall,\u201d were overly simplistic and aimed to give folks something to latch on to. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Vance also argued in 2016 that if White working-class people attended church, they would not be as attracted to Trump. \u201cI think Trump provides that sense of community that many in the White working class would have, if they actually went to church,\u201d Vance\u00a0told\u00a0New York public radio. \u201cI think if folks went to church a little bit more, they may not be as excited or as attracted to the sort of social experience that Trump provides.\u201d Vance once said racism played a role in Trump support Vance also said that racism and xenophobia played a role in Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cThere is definitely an element of Donald Trump\u2019s support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia, but a lot of these folks are just really hardworking people who are struggling in really important ways,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in a September 2016\u00a0\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d\u00a0Interview. \u201cDefinitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in an interview at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. Speaking with CNN in October 2016, Vance criticized Trump for\u00a0\u201cactively antagonizing\u201d\u00a0Black voters, claiming this tactic was a long-standing Republican strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak to issues of special concern of minority voters or Black voters, it\u2019s that he seems to like actively antagonizing a lot of the Black voters,\u201d Vance\u00a0said during a panel discussion. In a July 2016 interview with American Conservative, a right-leaning publication, he added Trump was making the problem of racial resentment \u201cworse\u201d by talking about \u201crapist immigrants and banning all Muslims\u201d as part of his message. To that end \u2013 Vance once tweeted he found Trump reprehensible. \u201cTrump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\u201d\u00a0he wrote in October 2016.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_nikki-haley-trump-rnc-speech", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is pitching voters on Donald Trump in her Republican convention speech Tuesday night, her latest step toward embracing her former rival and unifying the party. Haley intends to \u201caddress voters who are uncertain about voting for President Trump and make the case for why she is voting for him,\u201d a person familiar with her speech told CNN. Haley\u2019s speech was written in consultation with the Trump campaign and approved by Republican convention officials, as all such addresses are. Haley, who released her delegates last week and implored them to support Trump, was a late addition to the program. She was invited to appear onstage in Milwaukee only two days ago \u2013 the same day as the assassination attempt on Trump, which was followed by the former president\u2019s call for themes of unity at the convention. Tuesday\u2019s speech continues a gradual easing of tensions between Haley and Trump after a bruising, yearlong campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, in which Haley urged GOP voters to back her to avoid the \u201cchaos\u201d that she said follows the former president. After primary losses in New Hampshire and her home state of South Carolina, Haley defied calls to drop out and rally around Trump. Instead, she leaned harder into criticisms of the former president and his age. At campaign events, she frequently pointed out that polls suggested she would be more competitive than Trump against President Joe Biden in a general election matchup and warned that his legal troubles would dominate much of the campaign cycle. When Haley did end her campaign in early March, the day after Super Tuesday, she did not endorse the former president as primary rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had done. (DeSantis, who dropped out after losing the Iowa caucuses, is also set to speak Tuesday.) \u201cIt is now up to Donald Trump to earn the vote \u2013 those in our party and beyond it, who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\u201d she said in her exit announcement. But in May, Haley, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said she would vote for the former president, arguing that Biden would be worse for America. And last week, shortly after she released her delegates to vote for Trump, her former rival said he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at inviting her to speak at the convention. \u201cThere was a lot of bad blood there,\u201d Trump told Fox News radio last week. \u201cShe stayed too long. She was being soundly defeated at every place, but she just wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee, told reporters at a Bloomberg event Tuesday afternoon that he thought it was \u201ctremendously important\u201d that Haley would be speaking at the convention. \u201cWe want to talk about unifying the country, and I think that that\u2019s really where the president wants to go, particularly coming out of Saturday,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cSo having Ambassador Haley here is very important for us.\u201d Whatley declined to say when exactly the invitation to speak at the convention had been extended to Haley. Haley won less than 100 delegates, compared with the more than 2,200 who are bound to Trump, and she won just two primaries, in Vermont and Washington, DC. But in the weeks after\u00a0dropping out, she continued to receive tens of thousands of votes in primaries, including in key battleground states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Biden campaign\u00a0has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters\u00a0through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. Facing the convention crowd The question now is whether the unity Republicans are projecting at their convention has extended to Haley voters. Some supporters think it will. \u201cThe Nikki Haley voters will come around to Trump,\u201d said Katon Dawson, a longtime Haley ally and former South Carolina Republican Party chairman. \u201cIt might take a while, but they\u2019ll come.\u201d Dawson pointed to his own decision to back Trump and argued that, despite Haley\u2019s past criticism of the former president, the country couldn\u2019t handle another four years of Biden. He predicted the former governor would deliver a \u201cvintage Haley\u201d speech, focused on the future of the country while also striking a more conciliatory tone. \u201cShe\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d Dawson said of Haley speaking at the convention. But the crowd will also include thousands of Republican Party activists, some of whom are still wary of her after the primary. \u201cI have no problem with her speaking tonight, only if she puts her complete support behind President Trump,\u201d said Susan Cheatham, an Arizona delegate who said she thought Haley stayed in the race as long as she did to \u201cdiscredit and disrupt\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign. Angie Fisher, a South Carolina delegate, predicted that the reaction to her home state\u2019s former governor would be mixed \u2013 and some delegates might boo her. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, it\u2019s because they have Southern hospitality and won\u2019t do that an event like this,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cBut for the most part, people who support Trump are not in support of how she handled running.\u201d Aaron Farris, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota \u2013 where Haley won nearly 30% of the primary vote \u2013 said he voted for Trump but respects the former ambassador\u2019s work at the United Nations. \u201cStuff gets said during primaries,\u201d Farris said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s important that we\u2019re all unified going into November.\u201d Julia Black, another South Carolina delegate, said she supported Haley when she led the state but always planned to vote for Trump in the primary. \u201cI think she has come back into the fold with the rest of us, and I think she\u2019ll speak about unity and just advancing the party,\u201d Black said. Black said the criticisms Haley leveled at Trump during the primary were just a normal part of politics. \u201cWho won?\u201d Black said. \u201cPoliticians. They say what they\u2019ve got to say.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim", "text": "Friends and neighbors are remembering firefighter Corey Comperatore \u2013 the 50-year-old man shot and killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump \u2013 as a family man who served his community and was quick to help friends in need. Comperatore was one of the thousands of people who attended the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection effort. He died trying to protect his family, according to Gov. Josh Shapiro. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed his identity on Sunday. Two other spectators were seriously wounded in Saturday\u2019s attack, and the gunman\u00a0was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI is investigating the attack as an assassination attempt, the agency said. Shapiro, who directed flags to be flown at half-staff in Comperatore\u2019s memory, said he spoke to Comperatore\u2019s wife and two daughters Sunday. An avid Trump supporter who was excited to be at the rally, Comperatore dove on his family to protect them from the gunfire, Shapiro said. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family,\u201d said Shapiro. In an interview with the New York Post on Monday, Helen Comperatore, the widow of Corey Comperatore, shared her husband\u2019s last words, spoken as he shielded his family from bullets that ultimately took his life. \u201cHe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Helen Comperatore said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Get down!\u2019 That was the last thing he said.\u201d Comperatore also is survived by daughters Allyson and Kaylee, his mother, two sisters and a stepbrother, according to an obituary posted by Redmond Funeral Home in Freeport, Pennsylvania. Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for years, told The Associated Press he counts Comperatore as a hero and intends to vote in the upcoming election in his memory. \u201cAs soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,\u201d Morehouse told the AP. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever voted and I think it will be in his memory.\u201d Other victims are stable at a hospital The two rallygoers who were wounded \u2013 David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania \u2013 are stable, state police said Sunday in a news release. Copenhaver\u2019s family released a statement Tuesday through Allegheny General Hospital, saying he was in critical condition but stable. They denounced the shooting as a \u201chorrible, senseless, and unnecessary act of violence.\u201d Copenhaver was praying for \u201ca safe and speedy recovery\u201d for the other victims, their families and the former president, the family statement reads. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc. identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization\u2019s location in Westmoreland County. Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook Dutch underwent two surgeries after being \u201cshot in the liver and chest.\u201d \u201cThese victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\u201d said state police commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. \u201cThe Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\u201d The former president was shot in his right ear, he said on social media, leaving his face streaked with blood. A GoFundMe campaign for the victims\u2019 families, verified by the fundraising platform, had raised more than $5 million as of Tuesday evening, more than triple its initial goal. More than 63,000 donations have poured in, according to the website. A separate GoFundMe campaign for Comperatore\u2019s family, also verified by the platform, collected more than $1.1 million by Tuesday evening. That campaign, organized by a man who described himself as a neighbor and friend, had an initial goal of $7,000. \u2018It was going to be a nice day with family,\u2019 widow tells paper Helen Comperatore told the New York Post she and Corey were childhood sweethearts and about to celebrate their 29th\u00a0wedding anniversary when the family headed to the rally to support Trump. \u201cMe and the kids were all there as a family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.\u201d Describing her late husband to the newspaper as a \u201csimple man,\u201d Helen Comperatore said he put \u201chis wife and kids first all the time.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t lift a finger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did everything.\u201d His obituary said his life was guided by his faith, and he inspired others to live with purpose and grace. \u201cCorey\u2019s legacy is not just in the major milestones he achieved but in the small acts of kindness that marked his everyday life,\u201d the obituary says. \u201cHe was quick to help those in need, never expecting anything in return, and his impact on the lives he touched was profound.\u201d His widow also told the New York Post that President Joe Biden did try to call, but she doesn\u2019t want to speak to him. \u201cMy husband was a devout Republican, and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.\u201d However, Helen Comperatore added she does not hold the current president responsible for what happened to her family. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ill-will towards Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump, that\u2019s who I\u2019m voting for, but I don\u2019t have ill-will towards Biden.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did,\u201d she continued. Speaking Sunday afternoon, Biden expressed his condolences to Comperatore\u2019s family. \u201cWe also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a father; he was protecting his family from the bullets being fired when he lost his life. God love him. We are also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured.\u201d Trump has spoken with the Comperatore\u00a0family, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Tuesday. When asked by the New York Post this weekend whether he was considering attending Comperatore\u2019s funeral, he said yes. The funeral home obituary said details of that event are private. A community in mourning The Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company hung Comperatore\u2019s uniform outside the fire station Sunday in a memorial to his life. \u201cOur company is dealing with a tragic loss that not only is affecting our members, but this community and Corey\u2019s family and friends,\u201d the fire company said on Facebook, also calling Comperatore \u201ca brother, son, husband, father and friend.\u201d Matthew Achilles, who lived near Comperatore, told CNN affiliate WTAE, \u201cHe was a real good guy. He really was. You hear stories all the time that it\u2019s always the good ones that end up getting taken out, and unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d \u201cHe helped us out when I was real sick a couple years ago. I was in the hospital and almost died. Corey was one of the first people to message me and say \u2018Hey, how can I help you,\u2019\u201d Achilles said. Bishop David Zubik of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh said in a statement, \u201cComperatore\u2019s selfless act in the face of danger speaks to his strength of character, deep faith, and dedication to serving others.\u201d \u201cLet us also take this moment to pray for unity and an end to violence and inflammatory rhetoric in our community and across our nation,\u201d he said. In the outpouring of sympathy, many have highlighted Comperatore\u2019s dedication to the community he served. \u201cCorey Comperatore died a hero, the way he lived, shielding his family from gunfire. He was a former\u00a0fire\u00a0chief, a proud father and loving husband.\u00a0We will pray for his family.\u00a0May he rest in peace,\u201d Robert\u00a0Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Fire Fighters Association, told CNN in a statement Sunday. The Buffalo Township Board of Supervisors condemned political violence in a statement to CNN Sunday. \u201cCorey was a dedicated husband, father, friend, and volunteer to the community, and will be sorely missed,\u201d the statement said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_vance-trump-political-heir-analysis", "text": "JD Vance is the embodiment of the populist, nationalist and blue-collar transformation of the old establishment Republican Party. That\u2019s why ex-President Donald Trump \u2014 who never forgets the enthusiasms of his base \u2014 picked the Ohio senator as his vice-presidential running mate and effectively named him as a political heir who is now the best positioned Republican to inherit the keys to the MAGA kingdom whenever Trump exits. Trump rarely comes across as someone preoccupied with posterity \u2014 he lives in the present. But the selection of Vance is a nod to his legacy and anoints a leader of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement who could be active long after its author has left the scene. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that Trump chose an heir apparent a few days after surviving an assassination attempt \u2014 a horrific event that underscored the constitutional duty of vice presidents to secure the chain of power and assume the presidency themselves if the worst happens. The Ohio senator, who is only 39, injects a dash of youth into an election season dominated by two elderly men who have both been elected president. His selection caps a stunning political rise \u2014 he\u2019s been in the Senate for less than two years. And if Trump wins the election in November, a millennial will be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Vance made his name by explaining the political forces behind the rise of Trumpism before most people were paying attention to them in his book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d about growing up poor in Appalachia. The memoir describes human blight, economic pain and drug addiction sown by deindustrialization and globalization in Kentucky and Ohio. Eight years ago, he was often sought out by liberal commentators looking to understand Trumpism\u2019s populist appeal. In many ways, his quintessential American story is the antidote to Trump\u2019s biography. Unlike his new boss, he didn\u2019t come from wealth \u2014 he\u2019s a self-made man who rose from the lowliest of circumstances, heading to the Ohio State University, to service with the Marine Corps in Iraq and graduating with top honors from Yale Law School. Vance is exceedingly smart and eloquent and makes a case for Trumpism and his party\u2019s revolutionary departure from its internationalist, corporate roots in a way that Trump, who operates on emotion and feral political instincts, embodies but rarely intellectualizes. From Never Trumper to true believer But Vance was not always on the Trump train. He was an early, self-declared \u201cNever Trumper\u201d who once called the ex-president \u201cnoxious.\u201d Critics, therefore, accuse him of opportunism and of trashing his beliefs to become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal sycophants in the pursuit of power. The Ohio Republican has turned on the establishment and elite academe that helped make his name with the vehemence that only a defector can muster. But he has explained that he was wrong about Trump and now believes that he was a great president. Since Trump left the White House, Vance has emerged as one of his most vehement defenders and has enthusiastically embraced the idea that the ex-president is the victim of weaponized justice. He has also downplayed the assault on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, and in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins earlier this year, cast doubt on the facts of the most flagrant attack on American democracy of the modern age. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger. I think \u2026\u00a0in politics, people like to really exaggerate things, from time to time,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of folks, in the Democratic Party act as if January the 6 was the scariest moment of their lives.\u201d Vance went on: \u201cJanuary 6 was a bad day. It was a riot. But the idea that Donald Trump endangered anyone\u2019s lives, when he told them to protest peacefully, it\u2019s just absurd.\u201d But while Vance may juice MAGA turnout, he could alienate the critical suburban voters in swing states, especially women, who usually decide US elections, especially with his hardline position on abortion. Trump critics are also seizing on the pick to question Trump\u2019s commitment to his new unity message after he escaped the assassination attempt. Vance responded with the most searing reaction of any Republican. He claimed that President Joe Biden\u2019s arguments that Trump was an \u201cauthoritarian fascist\u201d led to the attempt to kill him, despite the motive of the gunman being unclear. There is always intense debate about how much a vice-presidential nominee really matters in an electoral context and whether such picks really help put a ticket over the top. But the Vance move makes a lot of sense when Biden\u2019s own team has said his best path to a second term runs through the Blue Wall states. Most assessments of the electoral map suggest Biden must at a minimum win those states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and add a single electoral vote in the Omaha, Nebraska, area to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Vance has a particular talent for talking to voters in the post-industrial Midwest. He won his Senate seat by more than 6 points in 2022 and he is an avatar for the political forces that turned the Buckeye State into a Republican bastion after years as a political bellwether. Why European allies won\u2019t relish the Vance pick The new Republican vice-presidential pick is also the embodiment of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies abroad and augurs another rocky period between the US and its European allies if the ex-president reclaims the Oval Office. He is in the vanguard of a new generation of pro-Trump lawmakers who reject the traditional US foreign policy consensus. He traveled to the belly of the internationalist beast at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year to rebuke America\u2019s European allies. And at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US, he explained why he thinks America should no longer finance Ukraine\u2019s fight for its freedom. \u201cI have \u2026 Republican colleagues, who are much more emotionally invested in what\u2019s going on 6,000 miles away than they are in their own country,\u201d Vance said at the conference. He backs Trump\u2019s position that the war in Ukraine should end and the killing should stop. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the country to have somebody saying, \u2018How long does this go on? How much money are we supposed to funnel into this country?\u2019\u201d said Vance, who has also argued the US lacks the manufacturing capacity or sufficient military reserves to send more ammunition to Ukraine. \u201cIf you care about Ukraine, but most importantly, if you care about America, you should be wanting this thing to come to some diplomatic resolution.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked Vance\u2019s criticism of the war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Collins in February. \u201cTo understand it is to come to the front line to see what\u2019s going on, to speak with the people, then to go to civilians to understand \u2026 what will (happen to) them without this support. And he will understand that millions \u2026 will be killed. It\u2019s a fact,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cOf course, he doesn\u2019t understand. God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory,\u201d he said. But Vance is listening to Trump, not Zelensky or the foreign policy establishment. It\u2019s not hard to imagine him deep in the West Wing as vice president implementing the hardline \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda at home and abroad, almost like a modern day \u2014 and far more populist \u2014 version of former Vice President Dick Cheney in the Bush administration. Ultimately, Trump is clearly comfortable with Vance, a favorite of his firebrand son Donald Trump Jr. They are cut from the same ideological and temperamental cloth \u2014 unlike the ex-president and his first vice presidential pick, the pious Mike Pence, who eventually broke with Trump on January 6 after concluding he lacked the constitutional power to throw the 2020 election to his boss. \u201cI think he was a good president. And I think that he made the country more prosperous. And I think he made the world more peaceful,\u201d Vance said of his future ticket mate in his interview with Collins, saying,\u00a0 \u201cWhat gives me pause is another four years of Biden\u2019s administration, where he\u2019s opened the borders, and where you have, effectively a conflict, a major world conflict in nearly every continent in the world.\u201d There is little distance between Vance and Trump. The Ohio senator made sure of that and it\u2019s made him one of the most significant rising powers in American politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/vance-trump-political-heir-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_fact-check-night-2-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night two of the Republican National Convention has kicked off in Milwaukee. CNN\u2019s Facts First team is fact checking the convention and will update this page throughout the night. Scalise on migrants coming to the US House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday that migrants are arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed from prison. \u201cOn the border, Biden and Harris opened it up to the entire world. Prisons are being emptied,\u201d said Scalise,\u00a0a Louisiana Republican. Facts first: There is no evidence for Scalise\u2019s claim that \u201cprisons of being emptied\u201d\u00a0so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants.  \u201cI do a daily news search to see what\u2019s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,\u201d said Helen Fair, who is co-author of the\u00a0World Prison Population List, which tracks the global prison population, and a research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London. Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly made such claims in his own speeches and interviews. But Trump has never provided any proof for the claim. Trump\u2019s campaign has provided CNN with only a vague 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart\u00a0about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents about Venezuela freeing violent prisoners who had then joined migrant caravans. But this supposed claim about Venezuela\u2019s actions has never been corroborated, and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no proof of any such thing having happened. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Rep. Stefanik claims that Biden presidency has led to the highest inflation of her lifetime Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York claimed in her Republican National Convention speech Tuesday that Biden\u2019s presidency has led to the \u201chighest rate of inflation\u201d in her lifetime. Facts First: This claim is out of date.  While the year-over-year inflation rate in June 2022, about 9.1%, was the highest since late 1981,\u00a0inflation has declined sharply since that Biden-era peak, and the most recent available rate, for June 2024, was about 3%. That rate was exceeded as recently as 2011.Stefanik was born in 1984. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn\u00a0 Wisconsin Senate candidate exaggerates the numbers of fentanyl deaths Eric Hovde, the Republican running for Senate in Wisconsin, claimed in his RNC speech Tuesday that the Biden administration \u201cemboldened drug cartels to flood our streets with fentanyl killing over 100,000 Americans every year\u201d by opening the country\u2019s southern border and allowing \u201ccriminals and terrorists to enter the country.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s a significant exaggeration that fentanyl kills more than 100,000 Americans every year due to the country\u2019s \u201copen\u201d borders. The number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids in 2023, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data.\u00a0 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said\u00a0in May\u00a0that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose, but that is the total number of people who died from an overdose from any kind of drug. Synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in the majority of those fatalities, making up nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023, but they did not account for all of them. In fact, compared with 2022, there were around 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023. The estimated number of deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamines increased in 2023. Specifically, in 2023, there were 74,702 deaths from synthetic opioids, and most of those deaths were from fentanyl. By comparison, in 2022 the estimated number was 76,226, according to the CDC. It is also worth noting that fentanyl is\u00a0largely\u00a0smuggled by US citizens\u00a0through legal ports of entry,\u00a0rather than by migrants sneaking into the country. Contrary to frequent claims by Republicans, the border is not \u201copen\u201d; border officers have seized\u00a0an increasing amount of illicit fentanyl, numbering in the hundreds of millions of pills, under Biden. From CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen Kari Lake on her opponent\u2019s record about voting laws Kari Lake said Tuesday that Democratic Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, her likely opponent in the state\u2019s US Senate race this fall, voted last week to let undocumented immigrants \u201cillegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d \u201cThese guys are full, they\u2019re full of bad ideas,\u201d Lake said in her speech. \u201cJust last week Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d Fact First:\u00a0This claim is false. The House did not vote on whether to allow noncitizens to vote. The chamber\u00a0passed a bill on July 10\u00a0that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Gallego voted against the legislation, which is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and\u00a0experts say it rarely occurs. When people register to vote, they must provide a driver\u2019s license or Social Security number, and their identity is checked against existing databases. Voters are required to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a US citizen.\u00a0Noncitizens who vote illegally can face imprisonment or deportation. Gallego\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that he opposed the bill because its \u201conly purpose is to disenfranchise tens of thousands of Arizonans, and I will not vote to take away the rights of Arizonans to stop something that is already illegal.\u201d \u201cOf course, only U.S. citizens should vote,\u201d said Gallego. \u201cBut this bill isn\u2019t about that, it\u2019s about making it harder for Arizonans to vote, including married women, servicemembers, Native Arizonans, seniors, and people with disabilities.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Perry Johnson\u2019s incorrect claim about median family income Perry Johnson, a Michigan business owner who previously ran for governor and president, said Tuesday that income rose consistently under former President Donald Trump. \u201cUnder Trump, family income went up every year. That is a fact,\u201d Johnson told the crowd. Facts first: Johnson is incorrect. Median family income fell in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic in both inflation-adjusted and non-adjusted terms. Typical family income grew by several thousand dollars during each of Trump\u2019s first three years in office, before adjusting for inflation. But it fell by $1,660 in 2020, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the US economy. After factoring in inflation, typical family income fell by nearly $2,900 in 2020, after rising in each of the first three years of Trump\u2019s administration. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby  RNC video falsely claims there is \u2018rising crime\u2019 A video played near the beginning of Republican National Committee proceedings on Tuesday evening featured a narrator saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not just big cities. Rising crime is a problem everywhere.\u201d Facts First: The claim that there is a problem \u201ceverywhere\u201d with \u201crising crime\u201d is false. Both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities. Preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% national decline in murder and a roughly 6% national decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020, Trump\u2019s last calendar year in office. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 \u2013 a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime. There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement \u2013 the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data usually has some initial errors \u2013 so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline \u201cever recorded.\u201d And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also \u201ccrime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/fact-check-night-2-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_joe-biden-nbc-interview", "text": "President Joe Biden sat for an interview with NBC on Monday, his first interview since the attempted assassination of his political rival former President Donald Trump. Speaking with Lester Holt, Biden reiterated that he was grateful Trump survived the shooting, but also pointed toward his opponent\u2019s role in raising the temperature of contemporary American political rhetoric. He also offered his thoughts on Trump\u2019s selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and continued to downplay concerns about his own performance at the CNN debate last month, emphasizing that he was not going to get out of the race. Here are some takeaways from the interview: Biden says he\u2019s grateful that Trump\u2019s OK \u2013 but points to Trump\u2019s rhetoric as driving the temperature higher While taking care to express how grateful he is that Trump was not seriously wounded in the shooting, Biden also blamed him for intensifying political rhetoric across the United States. He in particular pointed \u2013 as he often does \u2013 toward his comments after the rally of White supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and his denial of the results of the 2020 election that led to the 2021 insurrection at the Capitol. \u201cLook. There\u2019s so much violence now. \u2026 There\u2019s no place at all for violence in politics in America. None. Zero. And we\u2019ve reached the point where it\u2019s become too commonplace,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot assassinations, but to talk about, for example, January 6, the attack on the Capitol.\u201d He mentioned he only ran in 2020 because of Trump\u2019s comments after Charlottesville. \u201cThe then-president was asked, what did he think, and he said, \u2018Very fine people on both sides.\u2019 Not fine people on both sides,\u201d Biden added. \u201cNo excuse. Zero.\u201d Later he said, \u201cI am not engaged in that rhetoric. Now my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric: He talks about it\u2019ll be a bloodbath if he loses, talking about how he\u2019s going to forgive all the actions, I guess suspend the sentences of all those who were arrested and sentenced to go to jail because of what happened in the Capitol. I\u2019m not out there making fun of like when remember the picture of Donald Trump when Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband was hit with a hammer going \u2013 talking \u2013 joking about it?\u201d Biden declines to speculate on how Trump shooting will affect election Biden offered more details on the conversation he had with Trump in the hours after the shooting that left the former president injured. The president characterized the call as \u201cvery cordial.\u201d \u201cI told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing,\u201d Biden told Holt. Trump \u201csounded good\u201d on the call, Biden added. \u201cHe said he was fine. And he thanked me for calling him. I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me and his whole family was weathering this.\u201d The president declined to say how he felt the shooting will affect the trajectory of the 2024 presidential race. \u201cI don\u2019t know, and you don\u2019t know, either,\u201d he told Holt. But the president added he was focused Trump\u2019s health and safety. \u201cI\u2019ve thought less about the trajectory of the case than two things: One, what his health is, that he\u2019s secure, number one. And number two, what happens from here on in terms of the kind of coverage that the president and vice president and former president and new vice president get,\u201d the president said. President defends his rhetoric, but concedes bullseye comment was a mistake Biden defended himself against criticisms over his rhetoric, which has been put in the spotlight in the aftermath of the assassination attempt but said it was a mistake to say it was \u201ctime to put Trump in a bullseye.\u201d Biden made those comments during a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. \u201cIt was a mistake to use the word,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI meant focus on him. Focus on what he\u2019s doing. Focus on his policies, focus on the number of lies he told at the debate,\u201d he said. Biden sought to turn the conversation back to Trump\u2019s own words: \u201cI\u2019m not the guy that said, \u2018I want to be a dictator on day one.\u2019 I\u2019m not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I\u2019m not the guy who said he won\u2019t accept the outcome of this election automatically. You can\u2019t only love your country when you win. And so the focus was on what he\u2019s saying.\u201d The comments come a day after Biden used a rare Oval Office address to urge Americans to cool the political rhetoric on both sides of the aisle. The White House and campaign have followed suit. Still, Biden\u2019s past language under the microscope. Pressed by Holt on whether he has used inciting language, Biden suggested that it was necessary to characterize Trump as a \u201cthreat to democracy.\u201d \u201cHow do you talk about the threat to democracy \u2013 which is real \u2013 when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything \u2013 because it may incite somebody?\u201d he questioned. Biden says he feels safe with the Secret Service after Trump assassination attempt Biden said he still feels safe under Secret Service protection in the aftermath of the shooting that wounded Trump and that the agency continued to have his \u201cfull confidence.\u201d He said it was an \u201copen question\u201d whether the agency should have anticipated the shooting. \u201cI feel safe with the Secret Service,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat we did see was the Secret Service who responded risked their lives, who responded. They were ready to give their lives to the president. The question is should they have anticipated what happened? Should they have done what they needed to do to prevent this from happening? That\u2019s a question \u2013 that\u2019s an open question.\u201d The president also pointed to local law enforcement\u2019s role in helping protect the former president on Saturday. The efforts of local agencies have come under scrutiny after it was revealed a local police officer saw the suspect before the shooting began. \u201cThere\u2019s a major piece of this relates to domestic, local law enforcement. They play a large role. \u2026 I\u2019m not saying they weren\u2019t competent, either. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a complicated process,\u201d Biden said. JD Vance is no surprise as Trump\u2019s VP pick, Biden says Biden\u2019s interview took place soon after Trump announced Vance as his running mate at the Republican National Convention. Biden suggested he wasn\u2019t surprised by Trump\u2019s choice. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual, he\u2019s going to surround himself with people who agree completely with him,\u201d Biden said. But he also took the chance to point out the staunchly anti-Trump views Vance held before he became a senator: \u201cEven though, if you go back and listen to some of the things JD Vance said about Trump. \u2026\u201d Biden said, laughing as he trailed off. (Vance once called Trump \u201ca moral disaster\u201d and suggested he could be \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler.\u201d) Vice President Kamala Harris reached out to Vance on Monday. The Biden-Harris campaign said the vice president is prepared to debate Vance. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters", "text": "It was a remarkable moment Monday night at the Republican National Convention, surely creating some amount of confusion among longtime Republicans, when Sean O\u2019Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, delivered a stemwinder of a speech in prime time. He called former President Donald Trump a \u201ctough S.O.B.\u201d O\u2019Brien did not endorse Trump, but he leaned into the incongruity of speaking at the convention of a party that has long fought workers\u2019 ability to organize. The union could vote to endorse a candidate later this year. \u201cThe Teamsters are doing something correct if the extremes in both parties think I shouldn\u2019t be on this stage,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that the union has endorsed Republican presidents Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush in the past. This year, the Teamsters may not endorse any candidate, even though Biden has fashioned himself as the most pro-labor president in US history. Biden became the first president to join a picket line, when he appeared with striking auto workers in Michigan in 2023. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Teamsters are not interested if you have a \u201cD,\u201d \u201cR\u201d or an \u201cI\u201d next to your name. We want to know one thing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWhat are you doing to help American workers?\u201d Appearing Tuesday on \u201cInside Politics,\u201d O\u2019Brien told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash he would speak at both conventions, but has not yet been invited to the Democratic convention. \u201cThe partisanship is not working. We need bipartisan support, we need bipartisan cooperation,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding he would definitely speak at the Democratic convention. This after Biden bailed out a Teamster pension fund Biden must be particularly frustrated by O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech since as president in 2022, he OK\u2019d a $36 billion, one-time bailout of a Teamsters pension fund, warding off pension cuts for 350,000 workers and retirees. While Biden has the endorsement of key labor organizations like the AFL-CIO, there\u2019s growing concern among many labor leaders about his ability to win in November. Bash pointed out Trump\u2019s long history of opposing union rights, which O\u2019Brien did not dispute. \u201cIf we\u2019re not having the discussions, how can we change people\u2019s opinions?\u201d he asked. Republicans generally oppose organized labor, but JD Vance joined a picket line During his speech Monday night O\u2019Brien acknowledged the anti-union bent of much of the GOP and said it needs to change. That could take a while. Also Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, the anti-union Tesla boss who has endorsed Trump, would be showering a pro-Trump super PAC with $45 million per month in cash. But it is notable, as O\u2019Brien pointed out, that a handful of Republican senators, including Trump\u2019s new running mate Sen. JD Vance, have joined picket lines in recent years. Vance and other Republican senators, however, oppose the Democrats\u2019 proposal to pass a nationwide law, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, supported by labor unions including the Teamsters. Also, the selection of Vance, who also spent years as a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist, was praised by Musk. An anti-corporate message directed at workers, but an anti-union legacy for Trump If there was an overriding theme in speeches at the first night of the Republican convention, which were supposed to focus on Make America Wealthy Again, it was an anti-corporate and anti-elitist message, with frequent mentions of helping workers. That\u2019s in keeping with Trump\u2019s appeal to those who feel marginalized and left behind. Despite Trump\u2019s longtime pro-worker rhetoric, his record as president was decidedly anti-union, as CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore has written. The help Republicans were offering for workers at the RNC Monday, from a policy standpoint, is indirect. They\u2019re not endorsing raising the minimum wage, as Democrats have long supported. Trump is, on the other hand, pushing an idea to exempt tips from taxes. Many states allow employers to pay workers who get tips below that state\u2019s minimum wage. Trump and Vance\u2019s answer to helping auto workers is to end Democrats\u2019 emissions goals, which are meant to pivot the US toward more electric vehicles. The United Auto Workers is among the unions to endorse Biden. Marginal shifts are meaningful In an election that may yet be decided by marginal shifts in the electorate, any movement toward Trump among union households could spell disaster for Biden, who performed better in 2020 than Hillary Clinton in 2016 among union households both nationally and in key states. O\u2019Brien has a brash persona. He made headlines for nearly coming to fisticuffs with Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma who also happens to have been a professional mixed martial arts fighter. In a nod to that episode, O\u2019Brien namechecked Mullin and said he was paraphrasing the senator with this line: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s time for both sides of Congress to stand their butts up.\u2019 We need trade policies that put American workers first. It needs to be easier for companies to remain in America. We need legal protections that make it safer for workers to get a contract.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s worth going back to that original standoff between Mullin and O\u2019Brien, in which Mullin complained that a union had tried to infiltrate his plumbing business. That sounds a little more to type when you\u2019re considering traditional Republican views of unions. In Wisconsin, where the convention is taking place, the former Republican Gov. Scott Walker made a career out of busting government worker unions in his state until he lost a bid for reelection in 2018. Walker did enact so-called \u201cright to work\u201d legislation opposed by unions by making it easier for employees to work for companies without paying union dues even when there is a collective bargaining agreement. Multiple US states, most of them dominated by Republicans, have such legislation. There are many different types of unions and they each have different priorities. Police unions are going to see things differently than auto workers. Trump\u2019s promise to abolish taxes on tips seems tailored to gain some marginal support in Nevada, where he announced the proposal. Government worker unions are a strong part of the labor movement and unlikely to be getting any overtures from a new Trump administration, which has tried to paint the federal bureaucracy as an organized deep state opposed to him. But small movements among certain union members could have a huge impact in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_fundraising-takeaways-democrats-trump", "text": "Democrats outraised Republicans in competitive congressional races during the second quarter of the year, new fundraising reports show, putting down-ballot candidates on solid financial ground as Democratic concerns grow over President Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy. But several vulnerable Senate Democrats also burned through cash over the same period, reflecting a challenging political environment, as their candidates in the most competitive races spent more money than they raised. The filing period, which spans April 1 through June 30, only includes three days since the CNN presidential debate between Biden and former President Donald Trump. The deadline was also well before Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. Here are several takeaways from the latest fundraising reports filed with the Federal Election Commission: Senate Democrats maintain financial edge In the second quarter, Senate Democrats continued to display the fundraising prowess that\u2019s powered the party to success in recent cycles as they try to defend their narrow majority. Democrats outraised their Republican opponents in the nine competitive Senate races on CNN\u2019s list of the 10 seats most likely to flip. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents, raised $12.8 million, the most of any Senate incumbent in the quarter. And Montana Sen. Jon Tester - the only other Democrat besides Brown seeking reelection in a state won by Trump in 2020 - also had a strong quarter, raising $10.6 million. Vulnerable Democrats have also stockpiled large war chests as the campaign season approaches the crucial fall months. Three Democratic senators reported at least $10 million on hand on June 30 \u2013 Brown, Tester and Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen. Several other Democrats also had nearly $10 million in cash, including Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego ($9.4 million), Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin ($9.6 million) and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey ($8.4 million) Countering those efforts, Senate Republican hopefuls continued to mix personal contributions into their second-quarter fundraising. Four candidates - Tim Sheehy in Montana, Eric Hovde in Wisconsin, Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania and Bernie Moreno in Ohio \u2013 each loaned his campaign at least $1 million during the period. Hovde, a banking executive, has loaned his campaign $13 million since entering the race in February. Even as they enjoyed strong fundraising, however, many Senate Democrats burned through their cash in the second quarter, spending heavily on early advertising campaigns and laying the groundwork for highly competitive fall races. Four of the party\u2019s vulnerable incumbents \u2013 Tester, Casey, Rosen and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin \u2013 spent at least $10 million over the three-month period. And Brown spent more than $18 million, cutting into his cash stockpile despite his strong fundraising. All five spent more than they raised. House Democrats in most competitive races post big hauls A highly competitive battle is also underway for the House, where Republicans hold a razor-thin majority, and Democrats hold the financial edge there as well. Democratic candidates outraised their GOP opponents in 21 of the 22 of the House races currently rated as Toss-ups by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, the most competitive category. Arizona Rep. David Schweikert was the lone Republican in this group to lead in second-quarter fundraising \u2013 but the fractured field of Democrats competing in the July 30 primary combined to outraise him. Underscoring Democrats\u2019 fundraising strength, 11 of their candidates in the Toss-up races also reported war chests of $3 million or more, and five of those topped $4 million. Only three Republicans in Toss-up races entered July with cash-on-hand totals of more than $3 million. California and New York are home to several competitive House races that could determine which party controls the chamber next year, and Democrats outpaced their Republicans opponents in these crucial Toss-up contests. In California\u2019s 41st Congressional District, Democrat Will Rollins outraised longtime GOP Rep. Ken Calvert by about $850,000, while three other battleground California Democrats each raised about $1 million or more. In New York, meanwhile, a trio of freshman House Republicans \u2013 Reps. Anthony D\u2019Esposito, Mike Lawler and Marc Molinaro \u2013 were all outraised by their Democratic challengers and reported less cash on hand. Outside groups poised for big role The new round of FEC reports also show the leading outside groups and super PACs hauling in huge sums as they prepare to blitz the battleground airwaves with campaign advertising. In the fight for the Senate, the Senate Majority PAC, which is affiliated with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, raised $44.3 million and entered July with $124.3 million banked. The PAC outraised its Republican counterpart \u2013 the Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 which brought in $41.7 million and received $18.4 million from One Nation, the group\u2019s issue advocacy dark-money arm. Senate Leadership Fund also ended the second quarter with $117 million on hand to spend on the air against Senate Democrats. Congressional Leadership Fund, the main super PAC supporting House Republicans, entered July with $110.8 million in the bank. The group raised $46.4 million from April through the end of June. Its Democratic counterpart, House Majority PAC, files its reports on a monthly basis and will do so next on July 20. Senate Leadership Fund received large checks from notable GOP donors, including Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and Paul Singer, who donated $10 million each, and Walmart heirs Jim C. Walton and Rob Walton, who each donated $2 million. Congressional Leadership Fund received $10 million from hedge fund executive Ken Griffin, a prolific GOP megadonor. Singer gave $10 million, and Adelson donated $5 million. Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman of the Blackstone Group, donated $2 million. On the Democratic side, Senate Majority PAC received $3.5 million from Democracy PAC, an outside group affiliated with Democratic megadonor George Soros. These four super PACs are poised to play massive roles in the months ahead as the campaign season intensifies. According to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact, the super PACs have more than $589 million in future advertising reservations still set to air during the remainder of this year. Trump\u2019s growing Silicon Valley appeal Trump\u2019s campaign has seen a surge in support from the Silicon Valley moneyed class. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Elon Musk \u2013 who endorsed the former president Saturday less than an hour after he survived his assassination attempt \u2013 is prepared to plow about $45 million a month into a new group, America PAC, recently launched to support Trump\u2019s bid. CNN has reached out to Musk for comment. America PAC collected $9 million in June \u2013 its first full month of operation, according to its filing Monday with the FEC. Top donors include Antonio Gracias, the CEO of Valor Equity Partners who sits on the board of directors of Musk\u2019s SpaceX. He gave $1 million to the group. Ken Howery, Trump\u2019s ambassador to Sweden and a PayPal co-founder like Musk, also contributed $1 million to America PAC. Silicon Valley\u2019s growing affinity for Trump was evident Monday during the opening night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. David Sacks, a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur who co-hosted a fundraiser for the Trump campaign last month at his San Francisco home, was among the day\u2019s speakers. That only underscores the bridge that Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s newly announced vice presidential pick and a former venture capitalist himself, has helped the former president build to the world of tech investors, even before he secured the No. 2 slot on the ticket. As CNN previously reported, Vance helped organize the Sacks event. Some of Trump\u2019s longtime supporters are also opening their checkbooks. Filings show that Miriam Adelson donated $5 million last month to Preserve America \u2013 a newly reinvigorated super PAC that has pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars supporting Trump\u2019s candidacy. In the 2020 election, the Adelsons donated $90 million to the group in an effort to aid Trump in his unsuccessful bid for a second term.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/fundraising-takeaways-democrats-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_south-asians-representation-usha-vance-reaj", "text": "Shalabh \u201cShalli\u201d Kumar was filled with pride Monday night as Donald Trump made his highly anticipated announcement of who would be his running mate in the 2024 election. But it wasn\u2019t Ohio Sen. JD Vance\u2019s name alone that elicited the reaction for the founder of the\u00a0Republican Hindu Coalition\u00a0and the chair of the\u00a0Hindu and Indian Coalition\u00a0of the Republican National Committee. It was Vance\u2019s wife, Usha, a 38-year-old Yale graduate and the daughter of Indian immigrants. \u201cHindus have come a long way,\u201d Kumar said, noting the growth of their population and political power since he moved to the United States in the late \u201860s. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said, adding the Vances \u201care going to represent a new generation of Americans.\u201d The 2024 presidential campaign has seen three politicians of South Asian descent vying for the White House: Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy both competed during the Republican primaries, while Vice President Kamala Harris is running for a second term with President Joe Biden. On Tuesday night, both Haley and Ramaswamy are expected to throw their support behind the Trump-Vance ticket during prime-time speeches at the Republican National Convention. And as Usha Vance joins the Trump campaign, Asian American political activists from both parties say they hope the increase in representation will correspond with a push to connect with a voting bloc that has long been overlooked. The fastest-growing voting bloc The increase in South Asian representation in politics is \u201cphenomenal,\u201d said Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact, a national organization that works to increase representation and civic engagement among Indian and South Asian communities. \u201cSince Impact was founded in 2016, representation within South Asian communities went from approximately 50 elected officials to more than 300 nationwide, including obviously the vice president of the United States Kamala Harris,\u201d Patel told CNN. That representation, Patel added, is key because \u201cit helps reimagine what\u2019s possible for our community.\u201d Trump campaign sources tell CNN they think Usha Vance could appeal to minority voters. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of eligible voters in the United States, according to a recent analysis by Pew Research Center. Since 2020, according to Pew, the number of eligible Asian American voters has increased by 2 million \u2013 roughly the population of Nebraska. But despite their growing electoral power, both parties need to do more to engage with this critical voting bloc, said Christine Chen, executive director of APIAVote, a nonpartisan group dedicated to empowering Asian American and Pacific Islander voters. \u201cHeading into this cycle, we believe that the scars of 2020, in terms of what we experienced with the rise of anti-Asian hate as well as dealing with the pandemic, that everyone understands the role that elected officials play and the importance of us casting our vote,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe\u2019re also trying to reemphasize to the campaigns and the parties that they really need to do a better job in terms of reaching out to our growing base of (the) electorate, but also doing it early.\u201d Last week, APIAVote, in collaboration with AAPI Data, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the AARP  released\u00a0the 2024 Asian American Voter Survey, a survey of the key issues driving Asian American voters this election cycle. While 90% of Asian American voters surveyed said they plan to vote for president, Congress and other offices this November, the survey also notes that half said they have not been contacted by the Democratic Party, and 57% said the same of Republicans. \u201cThis is disturbing because this has consistently been the case cycle and after cycle,\u201d Chen said. That\u00a0lack of outreach, she said, has the potential to swing elections in battleground states like Georgia, where APIAVote\u2019s data shows the number of eligible Asian American voters exceeds the margin of victory in 2020. The key issues for Asian American voters But, Patel said, like every voting bloc,\u00a0the powerful symbol that representation brings also has to be married with substance and commitment to the issues that matter to Asian American voters. According to the Asian American voter survey, the economy, education, inflation and immigration were \u201chighly important\u201d for Asian Americans this election cycle. Kumar said immigration is top of mind for many South Asian Republican voters because of the backlog facing millions of Hindu and Indian Americans who are waiting for green cards. And while they differ politically, Patel said his organization has heard from many progressive Indian American voters who are also concerned about immigration, particularly the plans outlined in Project 2025 \u2013 the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president \u2013 that call for mass deportations. Chen said the work must continue to engage with Asian American voters \u2013 many of whom are immigrant, first-time voters \u2013 to understand the key role they could play in the upcoming election. \u201cIt\u2019s actually for us to protect a democracy,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cEveryone needs to participate. It\u2019s no longer a democracy if only a few participate in the election process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/south-asians-representation-usha-vance-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_secret-service-trump-rally-blame", "text": "The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump \u2013 the worst security failure by the US Secret Service in four decades \u2013 has pitted the agency against local law enforcement as both say the other was responsible for securing the building where the gunman perched. The public discrepancy is a significant departure from a normally close and successful relationship between the Secret Service and local police and could lead to an erosion of trust that further stresses security operations. With responsibility for a long list of protectees as well as occasional foreign dignitaries, the Secret Service handles thousands of trips requiring protection \u2013 a massive burden that demands assistance from local law enforcement. In an interview with ABC News on Monday, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said local police were inside the building at the time of the shooting, and that it was their role to secure the building roughly 120 to 150 meters away yet outside the hard perimeter and with a line of sight to the rally stage. \u201cThere was local police in that building \u2013 there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building,\u201d Cheatle said. A source familiar with the investigation told CNN that snipers\u00a0were stationed inside the building. The local sniper team, which hailed from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, was located on the second floor providing overwatch of the crowd at the rally, the source said. One former Secret Service agent took issue with Cheatle placing so much blame on the local law enforcement, telling CNN, \u201cThe Service is responsible for everything, not just the inner perimeter. They should make sure all of this is covered.\u201d \u201cOfficers inside a building \u2013 that\u2019s not mitigating a high-ground vulnerability,\u201d the former agent said. Patrick Yoes, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, defended the conduct of local, state and federal officers in the wake of Cheatle\u2019s comments in a pointed statement. \u201cWhatever happened in Butler, this was not a failure of the local, state or federal officers on the ground who responded to the shots fired at former President Trump.\u00a0They acted heroically and put their lives on the line to protect everyone at the event\u00a0and we must recognize that,\u201d Yoes said.\u00a0\u201cThis is a failure at the management or command level who failed to secure an obvious weakness in the security of this event.\u201d A\u00a0Secret Service spokesman told CNN Sunday the agency did not sweep the building where Thomas Matthew Crooks laid on his stomach and fired several shots at Trump. Instead, the spokesman said, that would have been the responsibility of the local law enforcement \u2013 a routine operational decision \u2013 and that there should have been someone assigned to the post. Attendees in the crowd noticed the gunman on the roof nearly two minutes before the shots were fired, a CNN analysis of witness video and the official video feed Trump\u2019s speech shows. Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents more than 1,200 officers and agents of the Secret Service,\u00a0stressed that state and local law enforcement are invaluable partners to the Secret Service, and that relationship is built on trust. \u201cThere is going to be an erosion of this trust caused by the Secret Service\u2019s injudicious statements,\u201d Pasco told CNN. \u201cThis is kind of a betrayal by leadership of the Secret Service of the brave men and women who go out there and do an extraordinarily great professional jobs every day.\u201d \u201cSecret Service agents and officers, the men and women who were there were heroes on Saturday,\u201d Pasco said. \u201cThey were let down by a management plan.\u201d The former Secret Service agent told CNN that investigators will have to determine whether there were enough assets or personnel authorized by Secret Service leadership, and it will need to be determined if the local police failed to maintain the integrity of their area of responsibility. \u201cNone of that changes the fact that, given the terrain and line of sight realities of that event, that the perimeter is not anywhere near expansive enough and is, in fact, dangerously close from a protective operations standpoint,\u201d the source said. Pasco, meanwhile, also objected to Cheatle\u2019s delay in answering questions and issuing a public statement. She told ABC News,\u00a0\u201cThe buck stops with me.\u201d Pasco responded to CNN: \u201cApparently it took two days for the buck to stop.\u201d The Secret Service pointedly dismissed accusations that it was trying to shift blame, writing in a statement on X overnight Tuesday, \u201cOur agency relies on the support of courageous police officers and local partners. We are deeply grateful for their unwavering commitment and bravery. Any suggestion otherwise is simply not true.\u201d Local officials say Secret Service was in charge During a press conference late Saturday, where the Secret Service was not present, reporters asked who beyond the Secret Service was responsible for securing the rally. \u201cWell, Secret Service always has the lead on securing something like this, but then they work very closely \u2026 I hate to use the word routine, but it is a fairly routine matter for all of our agencies to work jointly with the Secret Service,\u201d said Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Colonel George Bivens. \u201cIt really depends on the venue, on what information is out there, what number of resources are devoted to it, and we work with them to provide whatever is requested by the Secret Service. But they\u2019re the lead in that security.\u201d A Pennsylvania State Police official said that every asset requested by the Secret Service was provided. Video shows local law enforcement seeming to scramble to follow-up on crowd members shouting the gunman had climbed onto the roof. In some videos shared on social media, officers appear to be running toward the building as onlookers shout directions to the officer. A source told CNN that Butler Township Police also responded to the shooting \u2013 even firing a weapon at the gunman. Biden says he\u2019s comfortable with Secret Service For his part, President Joe Biden said that he feels safe with the Secret Service and that the agency has his full confidence following the failed assassination attempt against Trump. \u201cI feel safe with the Secret Service,\u201d Biden told NBC\u2019s Lester Holt on Monday. \u201cWhat we did see was the Secret Service who responded risked their lives \u2026 They were ready to give their lives to the president. The question is should they have anticipated what happened? Should they have done what they needed to do to prevent this from happening? That\u2019s a question \u2013 that\u2019s an open question.\u201d Biden also\u00a0pointed to local law enforcement\u2019s role in helping protect the former president on Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s a major piece of this relates to domestic, local law enforcement. They play a large role,\u201d the president said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they weren\u2019t competent, either. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a complicated process.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_how-trump-chose-vp-pick-vance", "text": "A day before Donald Trump\u2019s deadline to pick a running mate, after months of private conversations with every corner of his orbit, the former president took a call from a new voice. That person, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, was one of several people urging Trump in the final moments to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance. On Monday, Trump finally announced his choice: Vance would be his running mate. How Trump landed on Vance, a freshman senator from the heartland only half his age, is a story illustrative of the former president\u2019s showman instincts and chronic indecisiveness. A prolonged audition reminiscent of Trump\u2019s years as host of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d A constant stream of rumors, many started by Trump himself.\u00a0Vocal factions campaigning behind the scenes. A secretive vetting process that left contenders in the dark for weeks. And a surprise reveal adding intrigue to the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Trump announced his decision Monday afternoon on his Truth Social platform, telling his followers that Vance was \u201cthe person best suited\u201d for the role. Only moments earlier, Trump had shared the information with Vance himself, according to multiple people familiar with the call. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Look, I think we gotta go save this country. I think you\u2019re the guy who can help me in the in the best way,\u2019\u201d Vance told Fox News in his first interview after his formal nomination as the GOP vice presidential nominee. \u201c\u2018You can help me govern. You can help me win. You can help me in some of these Midwestern states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth.\u2019\u201d \u2018The Apprentice: Veepstakes Version\u2019 The political marriage between Trump and Vance wasn\u2019t an instant match. Earlier this year, as Trump was working to seal the GOP nomination, Vance had yet to even be approached by the Trump campaign about the possibility of joining him on the ticket. But as Trump sewed up the race, and the veepstakes parlor game began, Vance\u2019s team started to hear his name in the mix. Trump, who is known to float names himself during dinners with donors and allies, was one of the catalysts for the early intrigue around Vance. The first time Vance\u2019s team began to realize that Trump was formally considering him was when he received vetting paperwork for the running mate process in early June. The relationship between the two blossomed in the spring and summer over joint appearances at campaign events and closed-door fundraisers in California, where Vance, a former venture capitalist, helped Trump connect with wealthy tech entrepreneurs \u2013 such as Vance\u2019s close friend, prominent tech investor David Sacks. Their final meeting before Monday\u2019s decision took place at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, sources familiar with the meeting told CNN, and it came just hours before the former president traveled to Butler, Pennsylvania, for a rally that would end with an assassination attempt on him. One source familiar with the discussion described their time together as \u201cthe final interview before getting the job.\u201d Vance left Palm Beach confident of his chances but wasn\u2019t assured he would get the nod, the sources said. Meanwhile, Trump continued to flirt publicly and privately with other potential candidates, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, both of whom had also met with the former president last week. The behind-the-scenes lobbying for Burgum and Rubio continued until the final hours as Trump fielded calls from people urging him to consider others, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Trump spent the final 24 hours waffling over his pick, multiple sources told CNN, leaving even those in his inner circle guessing about his ultimate choice. The constant stream of calls echoed his selection process in 2016, when he wavered on Mike Pence even after he had selected him. During the call when Pence learned he\u2019d serve on the GOP ticket, Trump never formally offered the Indiana governor the job, only alluding to their joint ticket. Several Republican donors argued for Youngkin as Trump\u2019s pick in recent days as it became clear that Rubio and Burgum may not make the cut. A subset of the donor pool didn\u2019t want Vance as the pick and were pushing for anyone but him. But Vance had powerful voices pushing for him, too, including the former president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., a close friend and unabashed supporter, and former Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon, who touted the Ohio senator as the best heir to Trump\u2019s MAGA movement nearly up until the day he went to prison earlier this month. Vance also had the backing of Tucker Carlson, even as the conservative commentator\u2019s former boss Fox News Corp. magnate Rupert Murdoch directly lobbied Trump to pick Burgum and his onetime Fox News prime-time pal Sean Hannity campaigned for Rubio. Together, Trump Jr., Bannon and Carlson carried tremendous sway as vanguards of the former president\u2019s MAGA movement and high-profile influencers with his right-wing supporters. They argued that Vance not only had the strongest relationship with Trump but said that he would be the most loyal if selected to serve alongside the former president, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. They also made the case that Vance can appeal to working-class voters viewed as essential to winning the key battleground states in November, given his upbringing in a poor Rust Belt town north of Cincinnati. And Vance\u2019s wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance \u2013 the child of Indian immigrants \u2013 was someone they thought could appeal to minority voters, the sources said. Sacks and real estate investor Steve Witkoff, a close Trump friend, made late and direct pushes for Vance, too. Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville and Indiana Rep. Jim Banks reached out as well. Trump Jr. also made a last-minute push for Vance as his father waffled on the pick, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, urging him during a late-night dinner at Mar-a-Lago to pick the Ohio Republican. Trump Jr. told CNN that he said to his father at the dinner, \u201cListen, I think I\u2019ve seen him on TV. I\u2019ve seen him prosecute the case against the Democrats. I think no one\u2019s more articulate than that, and I think his story, his background, really helped us in a lot of the places that you\u2019re going to need.\u201d Even Trump\u2019s son, though, said he was left in the dark until it was posted on Truth Social \u2013 a remarkable secret kept under wraps until the first day of the convention. A change of heart It wasn\u2019t long ago that Vance considered himself a \u201cNever Trump guy.\u201d In the early days of Trump\u2019s ascent in the GOP, Vance, then best known as the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author, was critical of the reality tv star-turned-politician, questioning if Trump was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d in private messages. He said he was voting third party in 2016. \u201cI can\u2019t stomach Trump,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NPR at the time. \u201cI think that he\u2019s noxious and is leading the White working class to a very dark place.\u201d After the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape emerged of Trump bragging about being able to grope women, Vance wrote in a since-deleted social media post: \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us. When we apologize for this man, lord help us.\u201d Democrats have shared these moments repeatedly in recent weeks, demonstrating the challenge for Trump in picking such a vocal onetime foe. But Vance has since distanced himself from those statements, telling CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in May, \u201cI was wrong about him.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was going to be a good president,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd I was very, very proud to be proven wrong. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m working so hard to get him elected.\u201d Vance\u2019s about-face was a political prudent move. He entered a contested primary for an open Ohio Senate seat as a vocal backer of the former president, who ultimately endorsed Vance over other conservative alternatives. Vance went on to win that 2022 primary and the general election. On Monday, as Vance was nominated by his party, one Pennsylvania delegate quipped: \u201cIf it was only so easy in his Senate race.\u201d And therein lies one of the greatest risks for Trump in nominating Vance to be his running mate. He is relatively untested and has little experience. He won his Senate seat two years ago by 6 points \u2013 running 19 points behind Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, on the same ticket. But Trump grew increasingly comfortable with Vance the more he watched the 39-year-old defend him on television. A Yale graduate and a gifted public speaker, Vance has proved an articulate and effective messenger who has become particularly adept at brushing off tough questions about the former president\u2019s legal troubles. Other contenders for the running mate job also carried flaws. While Trump liked Burgum for having the right look for the part, many around him never saw the national appeal in the relatively unknown former software executive from North Dakota. Trump, meanwhile, closed the door on Rubio over concerns about their shared residence in Florida. Trump has long feared the legal system being used against him and that worry resonated with him in recent days, even as Rubio allies insisted it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for the senator to move elsewhere. In the end, Trump\u2019s comfort level with Vance won the day. \u201c(Trump) said rightfully that we have been very, very close for a long time, but especially \u2018Since I endorsed you in 2022,\u2019\u201d Vance said in his Fox News interview. \u201cAnd I would not have won that race without Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. The president\u2019s trust then and his partnership since then has been something I value a great deal.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes and Kit Maher contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/how-trump-chose-vp-pick-vance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_takeaways-rnc-day-1", "text": "With a white bandage over the ear clipped just two days earlier by an attempted assassin\u2019s bullet, Donald Trump stole the show when he made his first public appearance since the shooting on the opening night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Trump joined the man he\u2019d chosen hours earlier as his vice presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in a box in the 10 p.m. Eastern time hour for Monday night\u2019s final speeches. The crowd chanted \u201cfight\u201d \u2014 the word a bloody-faced Trump had shouted several times, while pumping his fist in the air, as the Secret Service rushed him off the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. It was a memorable moment on a day that Republican delegates officially nominated Trump for the third consecutive presidential election, confirmed Vance as his running mate and opened a four-day convention aimed at making the case for another Trump term and against reelecting President Joe Biden. Here are six takeaways from the RNC\u2019s first night: Trump picks Vance Rather than choose his running mate before Republicans gathered in Milwaukee, Trump wanted an element of surprise at this year\u2019s convention \u2014 and he got it, keeping the veepstakes guessing game alive until Monday afternoon. Trump called Vance 20 minutes before he announced he\u2019d chosen the Ohio senator on Truth Social, a source familiar with the process told CNN. The two had met at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, before the rally at which Trump was shot in the ear. The choice reflects Trump\u2019s belief that Vance is an effective communicator who can sell Trump\u2019s populist agenda \u2014 particularly to working-class voters in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where presidential elections can be decided by thousands of votes. \u201cHe is consistent with Trump\u2019s appeal to working men and women,\u201d Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said of Vance. \u201cAlso, someone who shares his desire to expand the base of the Republican Party.\u201d Vance now vs. Vance then Vance is something of a double-edged sword for Republicans, who are betting on his ability to communicate Trump\u2019s message but will have to contend with the senator\u2019s own history. Prior to running for his Senate seat in 2022, Vance was a venture capitalist, political commentator and the author of the best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d Publicly and privately, he was a strident critic of Trump \u2014 material Democrats are certain to replay for the duration of the campaign. Trump is betting that Vance articulating his evolution from Trump critic to supporter will prove much more potent than those older comments. After all, he convinced Trump of his change of heart. The former president\u2019s endorsement is what propelled Vance to victory in a crowded Republican primary in Ohio\u2019s 2022 Senate race. VP also-rans get their moments The Vance pick was Monday\u2019s big news, but delegates and convention-watchers heard from several other Republicans who Trump considered for the vice presidential nod, as well. They praised Trump \u2014 and some seemed to do so with one eye on 2028. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem bragged that she\u2019d implemented virtually no business restrictions during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cPresident Trump honored the Constitution. He let me do my job. And he let me keep my people free,\u201d she said. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin drew implicit parallels between his own background as the head of a private equity firm and Trump\u2019s business background \u2014 as well as Trump\u2019s first-term record and his own economic achievements. Rep. Elise Stefanik spoke for New York\u2019s delegation during the roll call to nominate Trump, claiming he will win New York in November \u2014 an unlikely prospect, given its Democratic leanings. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds got a primetime slot, telling the story of how his single mother got him into a private school. \u201cMy mom fought for me,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump believes that every parent deserves a choice and every child deserves a chance,\u201d he said. The most memorable might have been South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who drew a religious connection to Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt. \u201cOur God still saves. He still delivers. And he still sets free. Because on Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back up on his feet and he roared,\u201d Scott said. Teamsters president pushes worker-friendly agenda The strangest thing about the speech delivered in prime time by Sean O\u2019Brien, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters president, was that it happened at a Republican convention. Labor unions have long overwhelmingly supported Democrats \u2014 and have fought anti-union policies backed by Republicans, particularly in Wisconsin. But O\u2019Brien, the head of a 1.3 million member union that has not endorsed in the 2024 presidential race, said he refuses \u201cto keep doing the same thing my predecessors did.\u201d \u201cToday, the Teamsters are here to say, we are not beholden to anyone or any party,\u201d he said. O\u2019Brien said Trump is not afraid of \u201cnew, loud and often critical voices.\u201d What he didn\u2019t say is that Trump took policy positions while in the White House, and appointed a number of officials, that labor unions opposed. \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t stupid. They know the system is broken. We all know how Washington is run. Working people have no chance of winning this fight,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. O\u2019Brien used his speech to urge Republicans to take populist, worker-friendly positions that are at odds with much of the party\u2019s conservative orthodoxy. Much of it received a lukewarm response from the crowd. However, Trump and those in his VIP box stood and watched closely \u2014 an illustration of how Trump has turned much of that orthodoxy on its head. The speech was a blaring red alarm for Biden, whose route to a second term is dependent on strong support from union workers in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Also concerning for Biden, who is attempting to beat back concerns from fellow Democrats over his age, is the boost that O\u2019Brien gave Trump\u2019s image. \u201cWhether people like him or they don\u2019t like him, in light of what happened to him on Saturday, he has proven to be one tough S.O.B.,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. Trump eyes Democratic coalition The Teamsters president\u2019s speech was one of several ways Republicans attempted to chip away at the coalition that helped Biden win the White House in 2020. Donalds, the Florida congressman, was one of several Black Republicans who spoke \u2014 reflecting the Trump campaign\u2019s attempt to make inroads with Black men, in particular. Amber Rose, a media personality and influencer, said Monday that American families were \u201csafer, wealthier and stronger\u201d under Trump. She was there to appeal to a younger and more diverse audience, and explained how she became a Trump supporter. \u201cI\u2019m here tonight to tell you, no matter your political background, the best chance we have to give our babies a better life is to elect Donald Trump president of the United States,\u201d Rose said. The attempts to make inroads with union workers, Black voters and younger voters \u2014 even if only minimally successful \u2014 could prove critical in November, if the election is once again decided by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of key states. Ron Johnson\u2019s Ron Burgundy moment Two days after Trump was shot in Pennsylvania, many Republican speakers Monday night delivered cooler-than-usual rhetoric. However, a notable exception came in Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s speech, when he called Democratic policies a \u201cclear and present danger to the country.\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said it was a mistake, and that the senator delivered an old version of his remarks that had been erroneously loaded into the teleprompter, instead of a new version calling for unity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/takeaways-rnc-day-1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Blood could be seen on his face as he was carried away by Secret Service. Get live updates on the breaking news. Multiple presidents and former presidents and candidates for president have been attacked in US history, according to a CNN report from 2011 and a list of instances of political violence that includes attacks on senators, congressmen and governors compiled by CNN\u2019s research library. Multiple presidents, former presidents or candidates have survived assassination attempts In the pre-Civil War era, President Andrew Jackson was shot at while attending a funeral in the Capitol. The shooter fired twice, but the gun failed. Former President Theodore Roosevelt, like Trump, was trying to get his old job back during the 1912 campaign. He was shot on the way to a speech in Milwaukee by a saloon keeper. Roosevelt later said a folded-up copy of his 50-page speech slowed the bullet, which stayed in his body for the rest of his life. He gave the speech despite the shooting. Franklin D. Roosevelt was president-elect when a would-be assassin fired at him in Miami in 1933. The shooter, Guiseppe Zangara, missed Roosevelt but killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. He was put to death by electrocution. Harry Truman, who took over the presidency after Roosevelt died, was shot at across from the White House by Puerto Rican nationalists in 1950. Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a segregationist who was running for president for the third time in 1972, was shot after a campaign event outside Washington, DC. The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down, and he later rethought his politics. Gerald Ford faced two assassination attempts in quick succession in 1975. Lynette \u201cSqeaky\u201d Fromme, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, was foiled before she could fire at Ford in Sacramento, California. Weeks later, a woman named Sara Jane Moore shot at Ford in San Francisco but missed because a bystander grabbed her. Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton in Washington, DC, after giving a speech. His press secretary, James Brady, was more seriously wounded than Reagan and later became an activist for gun control. Reagan\u2019s shooter, John Hinckley, spent decades in a mental institution. He was released from court supervision in 2022. All presidents face threats and all former presidents also get lifetime Secret Service protection. An Idaho man was charged with the attempted assassination of Barack Obama when he fired shots at the White House in 2011. A man was charged with trying to assassinate then-President Bill Clinton in 1994 after shooting at the White House, and a plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush in Kuwait was foiled in 1993, after he left office. His son, then-President George W. Bush, faced a failed assassination attempt by a man with a grenade while visiting the country Georgia in 2005. Four US presidents\u00a0who\u00a0were assassinated\u00a0were all\u00a0shot Abraham Lincoln was the first president to die by assassination. He was shot in the back of the head in 1865 during an appearance at Ford\u2019s Theater in Washington, DC, by John Wilkes Booth, an actor in the play that night and Southern sympathizer. Booth fled the scene and was shot when he was captured weeks later in Virginia. James Garfield was shot at a train station in Washington, DC, in July 1881. He died from his wounds months later, in September, in New Jersey. Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau, a disaffected former supporter with mental illness who was angry at not getting a job in Garfield\u2019s administration. Guiteau was convicted and hanged within the year. William McKinley was shot in September 1901 in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. McKinley was making an appearance at the Pan-American Exposition. He lingered for days in Buffalo before dying from his wounds. Czolgosz was later electrocuted. John F. Kennedy was killed by a sniper, Lee Harvey Oswald, in Dallas in November 1963 as he was driven down a parade route in an open-topped limousine. Oswald, a Soviet sympathizer, was arrested shortly after the assassination. Oswald was himself killed by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas police station. JFK\u2019s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, was a senator from New York when he was running for president in 1968. RFK was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles the night he won the California Democratic primary. His killer, Sirhan Sirhan, is still in jail in California and recently had a parole request denied. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an independent candidate for president this year.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_political-violence-analysis", "text": "The motivations of the gunman who opened fire at former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday are not known, but the incident comes at a time of political anger and anxiety in a country split down the middle and bursting at the seams. Violence has targeted Republicans, Democrats, conservatives and liberals, and seems to be happening with agonizing frequency. \u25ba A plot to assassinate conservative Supreme Court justices was foiled in 2022 by the FBI. \u25ba The husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attacked by a hammer-wielding intruder at their San Francisco home in 2022. \u25ba A violent mob stormed the US Capitol in January of 2021 to interrupt the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win. \u25ba Would-be kidnappers hatched a plot to snatch Michigan\u2019s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 and were sentenced on terrorism charges. \u25ba A GOP congressional baseball team practice was attacked by a gunman in Alexandria, Virginia, in 2017. The then-House GOP Whip, Steve Scalise, was nearly killed. Those incidents range from organized plots to the irrational actions of lone attackers, but they all feed off a desperate and intractable polarization in which apocalyptic language is used to demonize both sides of the political aisle. A major question will be how Trump reacts The Republican National Convention is set to get underway Monday in Milwaukee. Will Trump use the shooting to further feed the idea among his supporters that the country needs to be taken back, or will the former president, who doesn\u2019t believe he lost the last election, call for calm? Americans need to treat this assassination attempt like 9/11 and unify, according to Ian Bremmer, the president of the political risk firm the Eurasia Group. But there is another direction that is more frightening. \u201cI fear it\u2019s going to be a lot\u00a0more like January 6, where there\u00a0will be a large number of\u00a0people that will weaponize what\u00a0just happened. And that we will\u00a0continue to tribalize as a\u00a0country and people won\u2019t accept\u00a0that the people on the other\u00a0side of the aisle are\u00a0American,\u201d Bremmer told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria. In the shocking chaos of the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Trump was encouraging supporters to \u201cfight.\u201d Trump yelled to supporters, pumping his fist, as blood dripped from his head when the Secret Service rushed him from the rally stage. Later, on his social media platform, the presumptive GOP nominee called for national unity. \u201cIn this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\u201d he said. As the gravity of the situation sank in Saturday night, over-the-top rhetoric was on hold, replaced by bipartisan condemnation of political violence and calls to cool things down. In a statement, Biden condemned political violence and called the attack on Trump \u201csick,\u201d while his advisers halted television advertising and put active campaigning on hold. Blaming anti-Trump rhetoric Scalise, now the House majority leader, issued a statement blaming anti-Trump rhetoric, which he said is \u201cfueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America.\u201d \u201cClearly we\u2019ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop,\u201d he added. One of Trump\u2019s potential running mates, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, issued a statement Saturday night, before the identity of the suspected shooter had been released or his motivation was known, blaming political opposition to Trump, and the Biden campaign\u2019s rhetoric specifically, for the shooting. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance said on X. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Trump\u2019s election would not break the country. \u201cYou know, if he wins, democracy is not going to end. He\u2019s not a fascist.\u00a0He represents a point of view that millions share,\u201d Graham said. Calls to calm down Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday that \u201cthe greatest threat to America is that we\u2019re horribly divided.\u201d He said Americans need to spend less time on social media, where divisions grow, and more time out in their communities focused on the things that unite them. Sen. John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat, noted on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Tree of Life Synagogue was attacked in 2018 in nearby Pittsburgh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in that place. It\u2019s the same kind of shock,\u201d Fetterman said. Cycles of political violence \u2018bred in the bone\u2019 The presidential historian Tim Naftali said on CNN that there have been other cycles of violence against presidential candidates in US politics \u2014 frequently at times of social change, including 1968, when Robert F. Kennedy and Marin Luther King, Jr., were shot. He said political violence is \u201cbred in the bone\u201d of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s something we ought to\u00a0remember \u2014 we are capable of this\u00a0as a nation,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe people who do\u00a0it, of course, are outliers,\u00a0but they are a product of the\u00a0extremism and the anger and the\u00a0hatred that sometime pulses\u00a0through our elections.\u201d The gunman, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had apparently been a registered Republican, and would only this year have been old enough to vote in a presidential election. His name is also associated with a $15 donation to a progressive political action committee. The FBI has been warning about the terror threat posed by domestic violent extremists in recent years. Last December, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned of the threat of lone actors as a top domestic threat to the homeland. Not all attacks on politicians are politically motivated John Hinckley was mentally unstable, seeking fame and to impress a Hollywood actress, when he tried to kill President Ronald Reagan in 1981. But the recent string of violent incidents falls into a definite period of division and anger. The Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN that Americans across the board are angry and frustrated. \u201cI look at data all\u00a0the time that says Americans\u00a0are getting angrier and angrier\u00a0about what\u2019s going on in this\u00a0country, that they are getting\u00a0more and more frustrated that\u00a0they think traditional ways of\u00a0solving problems are no longer\u00a0working,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/political-violence-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_minnesota-handgun-ban-unconstitutional", "text": "Minnesota\u2019s ban on 18- to 20-year-olds obtaining a permit to publicly carry a handgun violates the US Constitution, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. A three-judge panel of the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision that the 2003 law runs afoul of both the Second Amendment and the 14th, holding that the state cannot lawfully prohibit individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 from obtaining a public carry permit simply because they are not at least 21. \u201cMinnesota has not met its burden to proffer sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that 18 to 20-year-olds seeking to carry handguns in public for self-defense are protected by the right to keep and bear arms,\u201d Circuit Judge Duane Benton, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote in the ruling. He was joined in his decision by Lavenski Smith, who was also appointed by Bush, and David Stras, an appointee of former President Donald Trump. Tuesday\u2019s ruling comes as the nation reels from the Saturday assassination attempt against Trump by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Pennsylvania, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene. The shooter\u2019s age has turned a spotlight back on the nation\u2019s gun laws, including state restrictions pertaining to young people. The AR-style rifle Crooks used to shoot at Trump was legally purchased by his father, Matthew Crooks,\u00a0CNN has reported. The Minnesota law was challenged several years ago by gun rights groups and people impacted by the age prohibition. A lower federal court said the state\u2019s law was unconstitutional under a 2022 Supreme Court ruling that changed the framework federal courts must use when examining gun laws. The 2022 decision said modern gun laws must have direct historical analogues to withstand judicial scrutiny. The judges who issued Tuesday\u2019s ruling agreed with the lower court\u2019s decision, with Benton writing: \u201cMinnesota\u2019s proffered founding-era analogues do not meet its burden to demonstrate that the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation supports the Carry Ban.\u201d The appeals court also rejected Minnesota\u2019s argument that its ban was a necessary public safety measure because, the state claimed, \u201c18 to 20-year-olds are not competent to make responsible decisions with guns and pose a risk of dangerousness to themselves and to others as a result.\u201d Benton said in his ruling that Minnesota didn\u2019t provide evidence to that end, writing that \u201ceven using these recent (state crime) statistics, it would be a stretch to say that an 18-year-old \u2018poses a clear threat of physical violence to another.\u2019\u201d Andrew Willinger, the executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law, said the appeals court ruling \u201chighlights how much the historical focus shifts courts away from scientific evidence about brain development.\u201d \u201cThe panel seemed to require statistical evidence that 18- to-20-year-olds were\u00a0more than\u00a033% more likely to misuse firearms than other age groups; rather than evidence that brain development might make that age group prone to errors in judgment as a general matter and thus less trustworthy with guns,\u201d Willinger told CNN. The ruling is now a legal precedent covering the six other states in the 8th Circuit \u2013 North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas \u2013 and the decision could be used to challenge similar age restrictions in those states. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in the court\u2019s ruling, which he argued would undermine efforts to protect the public from gun violence. \u201cThe people of Minnesota want and deserve solutions that reduce shootings and improve public safety, and today\u2019s ruling only makes that more difficult,\u201d Ellison, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cDespite this setback, I remain as committed as ever to improving public safety in Minnesota by championing and defending lifesaving, common-sense gun violence prevention measures.\u201d Meanwhile, the gun rights group Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, which was among the organizations that challenged the law, cheered the decision. \u201cThis is a resounding victory for 18-20-year-old adults who wish to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms,\u201d Bryan Strawser, the group\u2019s chairman, said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/minnesota-handgun-ban-unconstitutional/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_guo-wengui-found-guilty", "text": "Guo Wengui, the exiled Chinese billionaire, was convicted in a US federal court on Tuesday for defrauding thousands of his followers of more than $1 billion. Guilty of nine out of 12 counts involving racketeering conspiracy and securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering, Guo, who is also known as Miles Guo, \u201cfaces decades in prison\u201d when the judge hands down a sentence on November 19, according to the prosecutor. \u201cMiles Guo \u2026 brazenly operated several interrelated fraud schemes, all designed to fleece his loyal followers out of their hard-earned money\u201d to fund his luxury lifestyle when he was in exile, US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement after the verdict. \u201cToday, Guo\u2019s schemes have been put to an end.\u201d After the verdict,\u00a0Guo\u00a0smiled at his lawyers and dozens of staunch supporters, who stuffed the\u00a0courtroom\u00a0throughout the seven-week trial in New York. He then hugged\u00a0lawyer Sabrina Shroff and shook hands with other members of the defense team. Guo\u2019s defense lawyers declined to comment on the verdict. When his\u00a0supporters\u00a0rushed out of the courtroom, a handful of them could be seen sobbing. Hao Haidong, a former soccer player\u00a0for China\u2019s\u00a0national team and one of\u00a0Guo\u2019s closest allies, declined to comment. Guo, who was exiled from China in 2014, gained a huge number of loyal followers during a series of livestreaming events when he portrayed himself as a former insider to reveal scandals, sometimes fabricated, of senior Chinese officials and elite businessmen. Guo is a close ally to former President Donald Trump\u2019s adviser Steve Bannon, who reported to federal prison earlier this month to serve a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. During closing arguments, prosecutor Ryan Finkel told the jury that Bannon was paid $1 million by Guo because Guo wanted to \u201cuse Bannon\u2019s notoriety and his fame to promote himself.\u201d Finkel said in the closing arguments last week that Guo raised more than $1 billion by guaranteeing his online followers that they would not lose money if they invested in his business and cryptocurrency schemes from 2018 to 2023. Prosecutors said Guo used money raised from victims as his \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d to maintain his luxurious lifestyle in the United States, after governments of China and Hong Kong seized his assets for money laundering investigations in 2017. \u201cGuo\u2019s schemes were sprawling,\u201d Finkel said. \u201cThey were vast. But they collapsed to a simple, inescapable, and obvious truth: Miles Guo lied to take other people\u2019s money.\u201d Guo\u2019s lawyer, Sidhardha Kamaraju, described\u00a0Guo\u00a0as a political dissident who had to conceal his locations and use cryptocurrency to move money freely from an oppressive regime. Kamaraju\u2019s final witness\u00a0detailed\u00a0that Jho Low,\u00a0aMalaysian fugitive\u00a0wanted by the US government, spent around $100 million trying to lobby the Trump administration to get\u00a0Guo\u00a0extradited to China. \u201cThe goal of making investors rich was also a way to spit in the eyes of the CCP,\u201d Kamaraju said,\u00a0referring to the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cMr. Guo is simply trying to show people that they could live the same life afforded to China\u2019s elites \u2026 elites like him.\u201d Prosecutors argued that Guo\u2019s political activism did not play a role in the fraud. \u201cIs Miles Guo a real political activist or not? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care \u2026 because that\u2019s not what this trial is about,\u201d said prosecutor Juliana Murray in her rebuttal to the defense\u2019s closing argument. \u201cGuo preyed on a community of individuals who shared in the anti-CCP view,\u201d Murray said. Murray also replayed for the jury a secretly recorded phone call between Guo and his subordinates in 2021. \u201cJust shut up. Shame on you. Shameless bastard, go to hell,\u201d Guo was heard lashing out in Mandarin to his subordinates over the frustration that he couldn\u2019t move $100 million between companies. \u201cYou bastard, get the f**k out of here!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the boss of a criminal enterprise,\u201d Murray said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/guo-wengui-found-guilty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_supreme-court-reform-joe-biden-ethics-immunity-term-limits", "text": "President Joe Biden is seriously considering publicly endorsing major reforms at the Supreme Court, a move that would make him the first sitting president in generations to back seismic changes to the way the nation\u2019s highest court operates, according to two sources familiar with the deliberations. Chief among the changes Biden is planning to publicly back are term limits for the nine justices, who currently serve lifetime appointments. The president is also said to be preparing to throw his support behind an ethics code for the court that would contain an enforcement mechanism, which was notably absent from the code the court adopted last year. Liberal lawmakers and groups have been calling for these actions in recent years. Additionally, Biden is considering whether he should push for a constitutional amendment that would effectively reverse the historic ruling from the court earlier this month that gave presidents immunity for some actions they take while in office. The Washington Post first reported the president\u2019s plans to publicly support the reforms. Biden alluded to the fact that he was considering major reforms on a call with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus over the weekend, a source familiar with the call told CNN. He told lawmakers that while he did not want to get ahead of himself, major reforms were likely coming and that he was in the process of consulting with constitutional lawyers, the source said, adding that Biden did not get into specific details during this meeting. If adopted by Congress, the changes would represent some of the biggest to hit the court in decades. Progressives have in recent years been pushing for such dramatic reforms at the court, but Biden has not fully embraced their proposed reforms, instead taking a much more cautious approach to the court that has included him forming a commission to look at potential reforms during the early days of his presidency. But as the Supreme Court came under intense scrutiny in 2023 following a series of blockbuster investigative pieces that turned a spotlight on the alleged ethical lapses of several of the justices, Democrats in Congress pushed for meaningful reforms at the court, though the issue never fully gained steam. The nine justices eventually released an ethics code in November that did little to assuage concerns from the court\u2019s critics. The reforms backed by Biden would need congressional approval and the constitutional amendment would require ratification by 38 states in a process that seems nearly impossible to succeed. The issue of lifetime appointments was illuminated by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, who was one of just a few justices this century to die while serving on the bench. Her death gave then-President Donald Trump an opportunity to appoint his third justice to the court, infuriating some Democrats who had wanted the liberal icon to step down during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. The court\u2019s decision earlier this month in Trump\u2019s immunity case also drew negative attention to the court from Democrats. Though the opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts technically allows special counsel Jack Smith to inch his election subversion case agains the former president toward resolution, it left many questions unresolved \u2013 making it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. A concurrence from Justice Clarence Thomas was then used by Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida in order to throw out the mishandling classified documents case against Trump. The Supreme Court has faced dismal approval ratings in recent years, with the public\u2019s view of the court worsening after a series of highly charged rulings \u2013 chief among them is the conservative majority\u2019s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade \u2013 and the\u00a0controversies over ethics and transparency\u00a0among some of the justices, including conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito. Biden has cited the Roe decision and others in his reelection bid. Asked about reproductive rights and the Supreme Court in an interview Tuesday with BET News\u2019 Ed Gordon that aired on \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d Biden warned about what he believes a future Trump presidency would mean in terms of future appointments to the bench. \u201cThere\u2019s probably gonna be two more appointments to the court. There\u2019s probably two people who are going to resign \u2013 uh resign, retire,\u201d Biden said. \u201cJust imagine \u2013 if he has two more appointments on that, what that means forever.\u201d News of Biden\u2019s forthcoming announcement was met with immediate praise from some progressive court reform groups. \u201cReforming this broken court is imperative \u2013 not just for protecting the hard-won rights of the last century, but for making any progress as a nation in the future,\u201d said Sarah Lipton-Lubet, president of the group Take Back the Court. \u201cWhile ethics rules and term limits alone cannot fully restore balance and independence, today\u2019s announcement is a watershed moment in the fight to take back the court.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_bob-menendez-verdict", "text": "A jury on Tuesday found Sen. Bob Menendez guilty on all counts in his federal corruption trial, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer swiftly called on his Democratic colleague to resign. Menendez, of New Jersey, was convicted of 16 counts \u2014 including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent \u2014 for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme. The verdict is a staggering blow for the Democratic establishment in New Jersey, where longtime state powerbroker George Norcross faces a separate racketeering indictment, and a stain on the party\u2019s national brand. Menendez, one of the most feared and influential figures in state politics, now faces decades in prison \u2014 and further questions about how he wielded his power as the former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury\u2019s decision,\u201d Menendez told reporters outside the courtroom. \u201cI have every faith that the law and the facts did not sustain that decision and that we will be successful upon appeal.\u201d Menendez, who faces sentencing on October 29, maintained he never violated his public oath and has never been anything \u201cbut a patriot of my country and for my country.\u201d \u201cI have never, ever been a foreign agent, and the decision rendered by the jury today would put at risk every member of the US Senate in terms of what they think a foreign agent would be,\u201d he said. Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said after the verdict: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t politics as usual; this was politics for profit.\u201d Menendez appeared to shake his head when the first guilty verdict against him was read. When the jury was finished, he leaned\u00a0his elbows on the defense table with his hands clasped in front of his face. When the court officer announced there was a verdict and parties piled in, both Menendez\u2019s daughter, Alicia Menendez, and his sister sat in silence, looking straight ahead and not speaking. They seemed to embrace once another. As the senator left the courtroom, he walked over to his sister and daughter, spoke to them for a moment and left. They all had serious expressions on their faces. Menendez\u2019s look was stern. Verdict shakes up Senate picture Even before his conviction, Menendez\u2019s case sparked a revolt among rank-and-file Democrats against the state party machine, which has for decades run roughshod over outsider candidates. The race to replace him, which began shortly after Menendez was indicted, initially featured first lady Tammy Murphy. The surge of support for her from county party bosses, over the more popular Rep. Andy Kim, now the nominee, led to a grassroots backlash. \u201cThis is a sad and somber day for New Jersey and our country,\u201d Kim said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cOur public servants should work for the people, and today we saw the people judge Senator Menendez as guilty and unfit to serve. I called on Senator Menendez to step down when these charges were first made public, and now that he has been found guilty, I believe the only course of action for him is to resign his seat immediately. The people of New Jersey deserve better.\u201d Should Menendez remain in the race as an independent candidate, that could split the Democratic vote, opening a path for Republican nominee Curtis Bashaw \u2013 a scenario Democrats are desperate to avoid given the\u00a0many challenges they face\u00a0in defending their narrow majority. Schumer, who had previously refused to weigh in on whether Menendez should step down, immediately released a statement after the verdict was announced, saying that Menendez \u201cmust now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign.\u201d From Menendez\u2019s home state, Gov. Phil Murphy and Sen. Cory Booker, both Democrats, reiterated their previous calls for Menendez to step down, and many Democrats on Capitol Hill followed Schumer\u2019s lead, including Judiciary Chairman and Majority Whip Dick Durbin. If Menendez doesn\u2019t resign, it would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove him. Sentencing set for October 29 Prosecutors successfully argued that the senator tried to use his power to advance Egyptian military interests, interfere in criminal prosecutions and secure investment from Qatari officials, among other things. Menendez and his wife allegedly received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible and other bribes in exchange for his influence. The senator\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but her trial was postponed indefinitely\u00a0by the judge after her breast cancer diagnosis. She has pleaded not guilty. The most serious charges of extortion and wire fraud carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison on each count. In all, Menendez faces a maximum of 222 years in prison for the 16 charges if served consecutively. However, any sentences would run concurrently unless the court orders otherwise. Sentencing is scheduled for October 29, just a week before Election Day. Menendez\u2019s co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, were also found guilty on all the counts they faced for their roles in the scheme. They declined to comment to reporters as they exited the courtroom on Tuesday. Gold bars, cars and cash Prosecutors\u00a0spent nearly seven weeks\u00a0untangling the\u00a0multiple corruption schemes\u00a0that they allege Bob and Nadine Menendez and the co-defendants were involved in. Federal prosecutors structured their case by chapters, calling witnesses to testify about separate schemes allegedly brokered by the senator in tandem with his wife. According to evidence presented by prosecutors in court, the schemes were brokered involved\u00a0Hana, Daibes and another co-conspirator,\u00a0Jose Uribe, the New Jersey businessman who allegedly bribed the senator in exchange for legal favors. Uribe\u00a0struck a plea deal\u00a0ahead of the trial. Uribe, one of the government\u2019s star witnesses,\u00a0testified that he bribed\u00a0Menendez in exchange for his influence to attempt to sway top prosecutors in New Jersey from pursuing criminal cases against his associates. Uribe testified about the conspiracy and how he paid for Nadine Menendez\u2019s Mercedes. \u201cI (agreed) with Nadine Menendez and other people to provide a car for Nadine in order to get the power and influence of Mr. Menendez,\u201d Uribe testified, in order \u201cto help me get a better resolution for one of my associates who was being charged in a criminal matter and to stop and kill investigations that could lead to my daughter and family members.\u201d Uribe\u00a0testified\u00a0that during a 2020 dinner, the senator told him in Spanish, \u201cI saved your a** twice. Not once, but twice.\u201d Menendez\u2019s attorney said Uribe, is a \u201cgood liar,\u201d and \u201cembellished\u201d his testimony to \u201cinvent corroboration\u201d with other evidence of text messages, phone calls, and restaurant meetings that\u00a0were\u00a0presented at trial\u00a0adding that Uribe did not discuss anything criminal with the senator. Prosecutors pointed to a meeting Menendez had with\u00a0Gurbir Grewal,\u00a0a former New Jersey attorney general, where Menendez allegedly brought up the cases of Uribe\u2019s associates to sway top prosecutors, but his defense attorneys claimed the senator was concerned the cases were selective prosecutions against his Latino constituents. Grewal testified that Menendez he never mentioned any defendants by name and the senator never asked him to interfere in any specific case but a colleague of the attorney general who was at the meeting called the interaction \u201cgross.\u201d Prosecutors alleged Hana paid Nadine Menendez three checks of $10,000\u00a0set up a \u201csham job,\u201d at IS EG Halal, Hana\u2019s halal certification business, as a cover up for bribes\u00a0and also made mortgage payments for her. Federal prosecutors alleged that Menendez helped Hana protect a halal certification monopoly with the Egyptian government in exchange for giving Nadine Menendez gold bars, cash and paying her mortgage. Prosecutors\u00a0also\u00a0allege the senator pushed\u00a0the country of\u00a0Egypt\u2019s agenda\u00a0for years and signed off on military funding in exchange for the bribes. Ted McKinney, a former top official at the US Department of Agriculture, testified that the senator\u00a0told him in a call to stop interfering\u00a0with his constituents after McKinney flagged concerns over the monopoly. Sarah Arkin, a former senior Senate Foreign Relations staff member under Menendez,\u00a0described\u00a0the planning leading up to an October 2021 congressional delegation trip to Egypt and Qatar\u00a0as\u00a0\u201cweird.\u201d Prosecutors allege Menendez ghost-wrote a letter for the Egyptian government to use to lobby other members of Congress over their concerns about the country\u2019s human rights record. \u201cMenendez wasn\u2019t acting weirdly, he was acting corruptly,\u201d Monteleoni said. \u201cHe was acting like a bribed man, because that\u2019s what he was.\u201d\u00a0 The prosecutor told the jury these actions were part of a \u201cbroader pattern of corruption.\u201d Prosecutors alleged Menendez met with Egyptian intelligence officials on several occasions, including a Morton\u2019s steakhouse dinner that was surveilled by FBI teams, and conspired with Hana to secure favorable military arms deals for Egypt. Prosecutors say Menendez pushed Egypt\u2019s agenda for years in the Senate \u2013 where he previously served as the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee \u2013 and signed off on millions in military funding in exchange for bribes from Hana. Prosecutors allege that Daibes used the senator\u2019s connections to secure a multimillion-dollar commercial real estate deal with a Qatari investment firm tied to members of the Qatari royal family. The jury saw messages between the senator and Qatari contacts, facilitating an introduction with Daibes. The senator also penned complimentary press releases about the Qatari government, which he instructed Daibes to flag to the Qatari investors to curry favor, records shown at trial revealed. Fingerprints belonging to the senator and Daibes were found on cash-filled envelopes that were among the items seized from Nadine Menendez\u2019s home, where the senator also lived, during an FBI raid. Serial numbers on gold bars also seized at the home during that raid revealed that Daibes had once possessed the gold, according to trial evidence. Meanwhile, other text messages shown by prosecutors at the trial illustrated a timeline of how the senator pushed the nomination of Philip Sellinger, the current US attorney for the District of New Jersey. Sellinger testified that Menendez had hoped the US attorney contender would look at a criminal case against Daibes \u201ccarefully\u201d if he secured the position. But Sellinger also said he never felt pressured to tip the scales for Daibes. During the trial, the senator\u2019s lawyers called five witnesses, including his sister, sister-in-law and the attorney for a friend of Uribe. A Menendez lawyer said the senator customarily stored cash due to familial trauma caused by the Cuban communist regime. (Menendez was born in New York City, and Fidel Castro had not yet come to power at the time his family left Cuba.)\u00a0In his closing argument, Menendez\u2019s defense attorney said the lack of evidence in the case against the senator made it \u201cshaky and rotten to its core.\u201d The senator\u2019s sister, Caridad Gonzalez, testified that her family\u2019s cash-storing practices were \u201cnormal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a Cuban thing,\u201d Gonzalez, 80, said on the stand. \u201cEvery Cuban who came to the States in the early 50s, 60s, 70s\u201d stored cash in their home and in boxes because \u201cthey were afraid of losing what they worked so hard\u00a0for,\u00a0because in Cuba,\u00a0they took everything away from you.\u201d The FBI seized a total of $486,461, 11 one-ounce gold bars and two\u00a0one-kilogram\u00a0gold bars from the Menendez home on June 16, 2022. Menendez\u2019s attorneys consistently suggested in cross-examinations that the senator was not aware of the deals his wife struck with the co-defendants, which included offering the senator\u2019s influence for a price. Prosecutors alleged that Nadine Menendez was an intermediary for communications between the co-conspirators and her willing husband.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_senate-seat-ohio-jd-vance", "text": "The Senate is narrowly divided and Democrats hold a slim majority. But there\u2019s no need for Ohio Sen. JD Vance, whom former President Donald Trump selected as his running mate Monday, to leave the chamber during the campaign. It makes sense to look to a senator as vice president: The role\u2019s main official duty is to serve as president of the US Senate, although recent vice presidents don\u2019t tend to spend too much time on Capitol Hill. In fact, there is a long history of presidential candidates selecting senators as running mates. President Joe Biden was at the end of a long career as a US senator from Delaware when he was tapped as then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008.\u00a0Biden and Obama both continued to serve in the Senate during the campaign, as did Sen. John McCain, the Arizonan who was Republicans\u2019 pick that year. Biden picked then-Sen. Kamala Harris as his own running mate in 2020. In 2016, Hillary Clinton picked Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate. Kaine never gave up his seat and went back to serving as a senator after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump.\u00a0In 2004, then-Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat, picked then-Sen. John Edwards as his running mate. So what does that mean for the seat? Usually, when a senator is elected as either president or vice president, they will resign from their Senate seat in early January after the election. Biden, however, is an outlier in this. He kept his Senate seat longer than most in early 2009, perhaps so that he could\u00a0edge past some other former senators\u00a0in the all-time Senate tenure list.\u00a0Biden sits\u00a0at No. 19. Vance\u00a0won his seat\u00a0in the Senate in 2022 and won\u2019t be up for reelection as a senator until 2028. If he and Trump win in November, Vance would need to resign before taking the oath of office on January 20. It would then fall to Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, himself a former senator, to appoint a replacement until the\u00a0next regular state election, when there would be a special election to fill the rest of the term. This can be a fraught process. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich went to federal prison for essentially trying to trade away the appointment to fill out Obama\u2019s term. For Biden, longtime aide and friend Ted Kaufman was appointed in 2009 to succeed him in the Senate. Kaufman did not run for the seat in his own right. California Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Sen. Alex Padilla to succeed Harris in the Senate, and Padilla has since been elected to the seat.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/senate-seat-ohio-jd-vance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Sinwar, the key architect of the October 7 massacre in Israel, is not \u201cconcerned with his mortality\u201d but is\u00a0facing\u00a0pressure about being blamed for the enormity of the suffering in Gaza, Burns said\u00a0at the conference, the source said. US intelligence officials believe Sinwar is hiding in the tunnels beneath his birthplace, Khan Younis in Gaza,\u00a0and\u00a0is the key decision maker for Hamas on whether to accept a deal. Burns \u2013 who for months has conducted feverish negotiations as the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration\u2019s point person \u2013 said it was incumbent on both the Israeli government and Hamas to take advantage of this moment, more than nine months since the war started, to reach a ceasefire. But the internal pressure Sinwar is now facing is new in the past two weeks, including the calls from his own senior commanders who are tiring of the fight, Burns said, according to the attendee who was granted anonymity to discuss the off-the-record conference. The CIA director was speaking at the annual Allen & Company summer retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, sometimes called a\u00a0\u201csummer camp for billionaires\u201d\u00a0because of its glitzy guest list of tech moguls, media titans and senior government officials who are invited to the secretive week-long event. The CIA declined to comment. The increased pressure on Sinwar comes as Hamas and Israel have agreed\u00a0to\u00a0a framework deal that that President Joe Biden\u00a0laid out\u00a0at the end of May.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0what US officials have said is being used as\u00a0the basis\u00a0to\u00a0an agreement to end the fighting. Burns had just returned from his latest trip last week to the Middle East to try to further the negotiations over a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, meeting with mediator counterparts from Qatar and Egypt, as well as Israel\u2019s head of foreign intelligence. On Saturday Burns said that there is a \u201cfragile possibility before us\u201d and that the chances of\u00a0a ceasefire\u00a0being agreed\u00a0are\u00a0greater\u00a0than they have been, months after a brief temporary truce saw dozens of hostages freed in November. But he emphasized that the final stage of negotiations are always difficult. The renewed push comes after the previous discussions fell apart in May following a similar flurry of meetings and travel by Burns in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also facing immense domestic pressure to strike a deal that would bring home the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Thousands of Israeli protesters regularly take to the streets of Tel Aviv demanding the government focus on the return of the hostages rather than the military campaign. \u2018Gaps to close\u2019 \u201cThere are still gaps to close, but we\u2019re making progress, the trend is positive,\u201d Biden said on Thursday, \u201cand I\u2019m determined to get this deal done and bring an end to this war, which should end now.\u201d Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health. Thousands are believed missing under the rubble and hundreds of thousands more face disease, famine and lack of shelter, according to aid organizations. Beyond the enormous amount of detail being hashed out in the potential agreement, talks are routinely slowed by the difficulties of getting messages to and from Sinwar as Israel tries to hunt him down. Of the three most senior Hamas leaders in Gaza, Israel is believed to have found and killed just one: Marwan Issa, the second in command of the military wing. Its military chief, Mohammed Deif, was targeted by Israel in a bombing on Saturday that killed almost 100 Palestinians and wounded hundreds more, according to Palestinian health officials. Neither Israel nor the US has determined whether Deif was successfully targeted. US officials believe that Sinwar no longer wants to rule Gaza and both Israel and Hamas have signed on to\u00a0an \u201cinterim\u00a0governance\u201d plan that would begin in the second phase of a ceasefire in which neither of them would control Gaza, a US official told CNN. Qatar has also made clear they would\u00a0kick out\u00a0Hamas\u2019 political leadership from their longtime external base if the militant group doesn\u2019t sign on to the plan, US officials say. In Hamas communications seen and reported recently by\u00a0the Associated Press, senior Hamas leaders\u00a0inside\u00a0Gaza called on external figures\u00a0from the group\u00a0to accept Biden\u2019s ceasefire proposal, citing heavy losses and dire conditions in Gaza. Perhaps an indication of their eagerness to end the fighting, Hamas recently backed off their key demand that a ceasefire agreement include assurances it would then lead to a permanent ceasefire, long a sticking point in the talks that Israel had refused. Netanyahu then insisted that any deal must allow Israel to return to fighting until its war objectives are met. That means a pause in the fighting could start, which would see both some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners released, before Israel re-launches military operations. The framework Biden proposed says that a permanent ceasefire would be negotiated during the first phase of a pause in the fighting, which would continue as long as negotiations do. On the same day the Burns was speaking, Netanyahu said at a news conference that he would not move\u00a0\u201cone millimeter\u201d from the framework laid out by Biden while claiming Hamas had requested 29 changes to the proposal, but he refused to make any. There are still \u201ctough issues to resolve,\u201d a source familiar with the talks told CNN after Burns\u2019 meetings in Doha. A second source agreed, saying there\u2019s \u201cstill a long time to go.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/cia-director-hamas-gaza-war/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_cnn-reporter-witness-trump-attack", "text": "CNN reporter Alayna Treene covers Donald Trump and was at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when shots rang out on Saturday. She spoke with CNN\u2019s Zachary Wolf about what she saw. What was supposed to be happening at this event? TREENE: It was honestly going to be a typical rally, like any other. I have now been to \u2013 I can\u2019t even count, upwards of 20 \u2013 the majority of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies since he launched his third bid, and it was a scene like any other. There\u2019s so much security presence. People often remark, \u2018Oh, you have to be safe, be careful.\u2019 And I often feel like being in a rally is one of the safest places, because there\u2019s always so much Secret Service. There\u2019s local law enforcement on the ground. You have to go through several mags (magnetometers). They have very limited options of what you can bring in. With CNN, we get security for ourselves as well, just given the divisive nature of the politics right now. So it was remarkable to me to see what had happened. Where were you situated when the shots rang out? When the shots went off, we were on the riser. We\u2019re in the middle of the crowd. There\u2019s normally a large crowd, and then we\u2019re above them. The risers are elevated. We\u2019re over the crowd so we can see. We\u2019re in line with the stage, and maybe 100 yards from the stage. We had just gone live right at the top of 6 p.m. and had begun listening to Donald Trump. Then, a couple minutes into his speech is when we had heard the pop, pop, pop. From my vantage point, it was to the left side of the stage. It was off of Donald Trump\u2019s right shoulder. At first I thought it was fireworks. I had no idea what it was. Everyone was looking, at least from where I was standing, like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And you could see Donald Trump. He was referencing a graphic showing some border numbers during his administration. And you could see him, his face looking in that direction as well, like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 before he touched his ear and dropped to the ground. From one direction of the stage, off to his right, was where we could hear the gunshots. But then, on the left side of the stage, there was a green tractor, and after the first round of the gunshots, of the bangs that we had heard, I believe that it had hit the tractor or something on the tractor, because immediately there was this cloud. All the steam came out from the other side, the opposite side of the stage. When I talked to people on the ground, they had said that they believed that the bullets had hit something in the truck that made the steam go off. At first I remember being like, \u2018Is this part of the program? What\u2019s happening?\u2019 And then, of course, we heard everyone screaming. Immediately, it went into absolute chaos. Secret Service telling us to get down on the ground. My security guard came up onto the riser and grabbed me. He said we need to get under the risers and pulled me under there, and essentially threw me on the ground and then put his body on top of mine. And I remember, I was like, I need to get up and see what\u2019s happening. But he was holding me and other people around me down, just saying, we can\u2019t move. Stay down. Stay down. And then we could see people started cheering, and I peeked out from under the risers. And that\u2019s when Donald Trump had been starting to stand up with Secret Service around him and putting his fist in the air and being escorted off the stage. And that\u2019s when we crawled back out, and I went back on the risers to figure out what was happening and what to do next. In the video, people can be seen standing behind Trump. Did they immediately know it was gunshots? When interviewing several of the attendees, many of whom were on the bleachers behind him, some who were in one of the very front rows, they had no idea what was going on. Everyone was stunned, including myself. I don\u2019t think anyone had ever expected something like that to happen. I was talking with my producer earlier today. Sometimes you go to these rallies, you go to so many, it\u2019s the same thing. You\u2019re just waiting to hear what Donald Trump has to say. But never in a million years would we have expected an assassination attempt like that. It\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think would ever cross our minds, because you always feel so protected with the amount of law enforcement and Secret Service on the ground. Everyone I spoke with who was there, including the people on the bleachers behind them, they had no idea. The venue was inside these fairgrounds, all grass. You had the large crowd, the press pen with the risers was in the middle of the crowd, and then you had the stage in front of us. But there was a fence, a chain link fence, surrounding all of it, keeping the rally inside. And the people next to the fence, closest to the building where the shooter was, some people over there had noticed and seen that there was a shooter, and they were screaming. And then, you know, shots broke out shortly after that. But the people I talked to who were behind him, they had a similar reaction to me, which was, \u2018Could it have been fireworks?\u2019 I interviewed one man, Joseph Meyn, he said the same thing. At first he thought it could be fireworks. \u2018Could this be part of the program?\u2019 One woman I spoke with today \u2014 her name was Renee \u2014 she was saying she was directly behind Donald Trump, on the stands behind him, and she had said she didn\u2019t really understand what was happening until she saw Donald Trump go down. And that\u2019s when she thought, \u2018Oh, wow, you have to get down. Something really bad is happening.\u2019 What happened next? How did you connect with Meyn? Immediately after, I went back onto the risers. Everyone\u2019s disoriented. People are screaming in the crowd. We went live, basically immediately. I started talking to Wolf Blitzer. A couple of minutes later, Secret Service just started pushing everybody out, unplugging our equipment and screaming at everyone, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out of here. You got to exit the venue. This is an active crime scene.\u2019 They came up to the press, started to tell us we needed to go. Started to pull some of us away and pull us down. (Phone) service also got jammed completely. So at one point we were told that they started to jam all of the towers for all the service. So we couldn\u2019t call anybody. We weren\u2019t sure how to get in contact with DC. Obviously, that was my first goal, when I was just thinking about what to do. But eventually we just started walking out. A lot of the rally attendees were very angry with the press. When I was still on stage, people were screaming at us, saying, \u2018This is your fault.\u2019 I think that they were really seeking an outlet for their anger, and at a Trump rally, Donald Trump often talks about \u201cfake news.\u201d A lot of people yell at us all the time. That\u2019s why we normally bring security. So it was a heightened version of that. We went outside the way that we had come in, and they closed down the parking lot as well. So everyone was trying to get into their cars and leave the site, but they couldn\u2019t. People were stuck in their cars for over an hour, maybe two or three hours, and we did some live shots, but then also we realized people aren\u2019t moving, they\u2019re here. So we just started walking around and saying, \u2018Hi, would you mind doing an interview with us? We\u2019d love to talk about your experience and everyone in those moments.\u2019 Most people felt that they wanted to share what they had seen and what they had felt. And so that\u2019s how those came about. Later Saturday evening, we had seen videos circulating on social media of where the suspected shooter was located and ultimately killed by counter snipers. Given we could not exit the rally area by vehicle, we ran over on foot with our equipment. We were the only camera crew that I saw, at least at that time, who had set up in front of the building. I spotted at least a dozen police cars, some from the sheriff\u2019s department, others state troopers, cordoning off the building. One officer later that evening had confirmed it was where the shooter had fired a series of bullets toward Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/cnn-reporter-witness-trump-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_iran-plot-assassinate-trump-secret-service", "text": "US authorities obtained intelligence\u00a0from a human source\u00a0in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Donald Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president,\u00a0multiple\u00a0people briefed on the matter told CNN. There\u2019s no indication that\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the\u00a0former\u00a0president on Saturday, was connected to the plot, the sources said. The existence of the intelligence threat from a hostile foreign intelligence agency \u2014\u00a0and the enhanced security for Trump \u2014 raises new questions about the security lapses at the Saturday rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and how a 20-year-old man managed to access a nearby rooftop to fire shots that injured the former president. A US national security official said the Secret Service and Trump campaign were made aware of the threat before Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cSecret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cNSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting.\u00a0USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump. All of this was in advance of Saturday.\u201d The Trump campaign would not disclose whether it was made aware of the Iran threat.\u00a0\u201cWe do not comment on President Trump\u2019s security detail. All questions should be directed to The United States Secret Service,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. Secret Service officials have warned the Trump campaign repeatedly against holding outdoor rallies, which pose greater risks than events to which the agency can better control access, people briefed on the matter said.\u00a0The warnings have been more general in nature, the sources said. \u201cThe Secret Service and other agencies are constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed,\u201d Anthony Guglielmi, an agency spokesman, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly.\u201d At one point during this\u00a0election\u00a0cycle, the campaign stopped holding spontaneous\u00a0off-the-record events where guests weren\u2019t swept by\u00a0Secret\u00a0Service beforehand due to security concerns, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The FBI, which is conducting the investigation into Saturday\u2019s shooting, declined to comment. NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said there\u2019s\u00a0no\u00a0known link between shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks and\u00a0anyone\u00a0else at the moment. \u201cThe investigation of Saturday\u2019s attempted assassination of former President Trump is active and ongoing.\u00a0At this time, law enforcement has reported that their investigation has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic,\u201d Watson said. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied there is an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump. \u201cThese accusations are unsubstantiated and malicious. From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani. Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice,\u201d a spokesperson for the mission told CNN, referencing Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian military\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed\u00a0by a US airstrike at Baghdad International Airport in January 2020. CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria pressed Iran\u2019s acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani on the alleged Iranian assassination plot, asking in an interview if the plot was in retaliation for Soleimani\u2019s killing, which took place during the Trump administration. \u201cI told you explicitly that we would resort to legal and judicial procedures and frameworks at the domestic level and international level in order to bring the perpetrators and military advisers of General Soleimani\u2019s assassination to justice,\u201d Kani told Zakaria in an interview that will air Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d Pressed further if that meant not using violent measures, Kani said, \u201cWe will only resort to Iranian and international legal and judicial procedures.\u201d \u201cUntil now, we have done it, and this is our right and of course we will continue it. And the Americans openly said that, that they assassinated the senior Iranian military commander. So it is our natural right in order to follow this issue, and those who are accused in this case, they should be brought to justice in a \u2014 in a just court,\u201d Kani said. Trump and the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, will hold their first official campaign rally together on Saturday at an indoor arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the campaign announced Tuesday. Surge of threats from Iranian state-backed media Iran has repeatedly vowed revenge for the US military\u2019s killing of Soleimani. And former senior Trump administration officials who worked on national security have had tight security since leaving\u00a0the\u00a0government. In August 2022, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against a member of the IRGC for allegedly trying to orchestrate the assassination of John Bolton, who served as Trump\u2019s national security\u00a0adviser.\u00a0US\u00a0prosecutors said the plot against Bolton was \u201clikely in retaliation\u201d for Soleimani\u2019s assassination. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also a target of the Iranian assassination plot, according to a federal law enforcement source familiar with the investigation and a source close to Pompeo. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, had a US government security detail due to threats from Iran, like Pompeo and other former Trump officials, but that detail was dropped last summer, according to sources familiar with the matter. O\u2019Brien is now paying for his own private security detail, sources said. Lawmakers were not given a specific reason for the decision, which led to frustration. O\u2019Brien did not respond to a request for comment. Bolton still has his Secret Service detail. For months, law enforcement officials have been concerned about the persistent threat of Iran potentially attempting to assassinate former Trump officials and the former president himself, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. But the recent intelligence suggested a significant uptick in the threat, the sources told CNN. Warnings about that operational planning have coincided with a noticeable surge of online messaging from Iranian accounts and state-backed media mentioning Trump, which has raised security concerns among US officials, one of the sources told CNN. CNN\u2019s Josh Campbell contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_jd-vance-trump-vp-what-to-know", "text": "With Donald Trump\u2019s choice to make JD Vance his running mate, he adds to the ticket an author and senator once known as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the former president\u2019s voter base. The onetime \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance, 39, shot to fame over his 2016 memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d and would eventually win over Trump ahead of his run for Senate. The former lawyer and venture capitalist has since become a loyal follower of Trump and heir-apparent to his particular brand of Republican populist politics. Family and background\n                   Vance was born in Middletown, Ohio, on August 2, 1984, and spent some of his childhood in Kentucky. He served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 before attending the Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Vance later worked as a venture capitalist before running for office. Vance\u2019s wife, Usha, is a fellow Yale Law School alum who previously clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was a federal appellate judge.\u00a0In 2015, she started as an associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson, where she handled \u201ccomplex civil litigation and appeals\u201d in sectors that included \u201chigher education, local government, entertainment, and technology, including semiconductors,\u201d her employee biography said. The firm announced Monday that she had resigned. Usha Vance grew up in a suburb of San Diego as the daughter of Indian immigrants. The Vances have three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. \u2018Hillbilly Elegy\u2019 In 2016, JD Vance released his bestselling book, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d which chronicled his childhood in a poor Rust Belt town in eastern Ohio and captured the struggles of America\u2019s White working class. His understanding of the population that turned out to support Trump\u2019s first presidential run made him a frequent guest on cable news programs during Trump\u2019s run and presidency. He was a CNN contributor from 2017 to 2018. The book was turned into a 2020 Netflix movie starring Amy Adams and Glenn Close. Once a Trump critic CNN\u2019s KFile reported last month that Vance liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one post speculating that Vance could serve in 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 something Vance now defends Trump over. KFile also previously reported that Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance in February 2016\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler,\u201d\u00a0and a few months later\u00a0wrote in The Atlantic\u00a0that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also\u00a0said he\u00a0even contemplated voting for Clinton in 2016, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin. Senate\n                   The freshman senator from Ohio won his election in 2022 after receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement out of a pack of better-polling rivals. He was also funded heavily by pro-Trump tech mogul Peter Thiel. Vance has been a vocal opponent of foreign aid in Congress, opposing legislation to send more aid from the US to Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s war. A day after Ohio voters approved a 2023 ballot measure to protect access to abortion, Vance urged Republicans to embrace a federal ban on the procedure to more effectively make the case to voters about the GOP\u2019s position \u2014 breaking from Trump\u2019s stance that the issue should be left up to states. Recent Trump support Since receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement for Senate, Vance has become a strong ally of the former president. Ahead of his Senate campaign, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told\u00a0CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. Recently, Vance stood by Trump\u2019s side at a New York courthouse during the former president\u2019s criminal hush money trial. He has also made clear that his view of the constitutional limits on a vice president\u2019s role in certifying election results differs from that of former Vice President Mike Pence, who drew Trump\u2019s ire in January 2021 when he opted not to interfere in the process of approving electoral votes for Joe Biden. Vance earlier this year told ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d that he would not have certified the 2020 election results until states submitted pro-Trump electors. The Ohio senator committed to accepting the 2024 election results in May during an interview with CNN, provided it\u2019s a \u201cfree and fair election\u201d and despite the winner. He emphasized then that Republicans and Democrats should have the opportunity to pursue any issues in the elections, as they have in the past, pointing to 2000 and 2020. No evidence of widespread fraud was found in the 2020 election. Following Saturday\u2019s attempted assassination of Trump, Vance posted on social media in part blaming Biden\u2019s campaign: \u201cToday is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

That evidence included video originally from the right-wing group\u00a0Project Veritas, which the Justice Department prosecutor, Jennifer Kerkhoff Muyskens, formerly of the DC US Attorney\u2019s Office, allegedly tried to obscure so the origin of the videos would be kept secret, according to a lengthy new complaint from the attorney discipline office in Washington, DC. Muyskens was the lead prosecutor in more than 200 cases related to\u00a0riots and property destruction\u00a0around the 2017 inauguration, where there were several unpermitted protests against Trump that led to street clashes in the capital city. After one of the first few trials ended in acquittals, essentially all of the cases were\u00a0eventually dropped\u00a0by the Justice Department by mid-2018. Project Veritas had covertly recorded meetings of a group that organized these anti-Trump protests, and the prosecutor had used versions of those videos that edited out key information, including that Project Veritas was behind the videos, the complaint says. Muyskens also faces an accusation that she lied to the court and misled the grand jury, the complaint states. CNN has reached out to Muyskens, the US attorney\u2019s office in DC where she used to work, and the US attorney\u2019s office in Utah where she appears to currently work. Hiding evidence can be a serious violation of a criminal defendants\u2019 rights. Muyskens knew that her \u201cediting of the original videos could hurt the prosecution and help the defense,\u201d the complaint, from disciplinary counsel Hamilton Fox, says. Fox also claimed Muyskens\u2019 \u201cstatements and omissions to the government \u2026 were false and misleading.\u201d The bar\u2019s disciplinary lawyer is accusing Muysken of editing video that she used in the cases in a way that omitted exculpatory content from the footage, include content from the planning session that suggested that aim of the 2017 inauguration march was peaceful protest. Muysken is also accused of withholding from defense teams video footage that showed \u201cProject Veritas operatives discussing their infiltration operation of DisruptJ20, which supported the defense\u2019s theory that Project Veritas conspired to blame DisruptJ20 for others\u2019 misconduct,\u201d the complaint says. When the authenticity of the videos was challenged by the defense team in a 2017 trial in one of the cases, Muysken and another prosecutor allegedly \u201cdid not disclose how they had edited the original videos they received from Project Veritas, nor did they disclose that they had omitted from discovery many other videos Project Veritas videos of DisruptJ20\u2019s planning meetings.\u201d The complaint alleges that Muysken also made false and misleading statements in both the probe by the bar\u2019s disciplinary office and in an DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility investigations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/doj-prosecutor-accused-of-mishandling-evidence-in-trump-inauguration-protest-cases/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_fact-check-biden-false-claims-israel-immigration-spending", "text": "In a new\u00a0interview\u00a0with a youth culture media outlet, President Joe Biden made false or misleading claims about immigration, inflation, his administration\u2019s spending, and a remark he made about Israel at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate. Biden sat down Friday with Speedy Morman, a host for\u00a0Complex. Here is a fact check of some of Biden\u2019s comments, which were released in a YouTube video Monday. Biden on his debate remark about Israel Morman\u00a0asked\u00a0Biden about his debate remark that \u201cwe\u2019re providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\u201d Biden responded, \u201cI said defensive\u00a0weapons. I denied them offensive weapons that they were using, 2,000-pound bombs and the rest.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim is false. It\u2019s not true that he specified at the debate that he was talking about \u201cdefensive\u201d weapons. Morman quoted him correctly; Biden\u00a0said at the debate, \u201cWe\u2019re providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.\u201d\u00a0In addition, Biden\u2019s administration has said he has withheld only a single shipment of 2,000-pound bombs from Israel \u2013 not those 2,000 bombs and \u201cthe rest.\u201d Biden himself said at the debate that \u201cthe only thing I\u2019ve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs.\u201d After sending Israel thousands of 2,000-pound bombs during the war in Gaza, which began after Hamas\u2019 terror attack on Israel in October, the Biden administration paused a recent planned shipment over concerns about possible harm to innocent people in highly populated areas. But the administration continues to provide Israel with\u00a0500-pound bombs\u00a0and various other weapons.\u00a0(There is no single definition of what constitutes an \u201coffensive weapon,\u201d nor a consensus about which acts by Israel should be considered defensive or offensive.) After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broadly claimed in a June video that the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,\u201d US envoy Amos Hochstein told Netanyahu the claim was \u201ccompletely untrue,\u201d a senior US official told CNN. Also, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Netanyahu\u2019s claim was \u201cincorrect,\u201d and Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that \u201cit\u2019s regular order\u201d when it comes to providing military supplies to Israel \u201cwith the exception of that one system that we\u2019ve talked about many times in public,\u201d\u00a0the 2,000-pound bombs. Biden on his tightening of the border Touting\u00a0the impact of the\u00a0executive action he took in June\u00a0to tighten the southern border, Biden said, \u201cGuess what? The number of people seeking to come into the country is down lower than it was at any time when he [Donald Trump] was president.\u201d Facts First: This is false. US encounters with migrants at the southern border did fall in June, but the number of encounters was lower during most of the Trump presidency \u2013 throughout 2017 and 2018, eight months of 2019 (there was a spike in part of that year), and again throughout 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic limited global movement\u00a0and Trump tightly restricted\u00a0the border.  The key number monitored by federal officials under Biden\u2019s executive action, Border Patrol encounters with migrants on the southern border in between legal ports of entry, was 83,536 in June 2024, figures released after Biden\u2019s interview show. This was lower than the figure in June 2019, which US Customs and Border Protection calls \u201cthe last comparable year prior to the pandemic.\u201d Still, the June 2024 number was higher than the numbers for June 2017 and June 2018 \u2013 and higher than every other month in those Trump-era years \u2013 plus higher than the number for June 2020 and the rest of that year. The Biden administration has made far more modest claims than the president did. In a press release Monday, US Customs and Border Protection noted the June figure was the lowest since January 2021 \u2013 the month Biden took office \u2013 but didn\u2019t claim it was the lowest since Trump took office in January 2017, as Biden implied. Asked for comment, a White House official told CNN on Tuesday that the current seven-day average for encounters between ports of entry has fallen below the seven-day average as of January 19, 2021, the day before Trump left office. That\u2019s fair, but Biden\u2019s own claim was much broader. Biden on his administration\u2019s spending Biden\u00a0claimed: \u201cAll the programs that I\u2019ve initiated have saved the government money.\u201d He cited the $160 billion in savings that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u00a0expects\u00a0will be achieved through two of the main prescription drug provisions in his Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that \u201call\u201d of his new programs have saved the government money is false. Though he\u2019s right that these prescription drug policies are projected to save the government $160 billion, numerous other Biden initiatives have cost the government money. Marc\u00a0Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a May email: \u201cThe President has signed into law and action a mixture of deficit-increasing and deficit-reducing policies \u2014 but far more so on the deficit-boosting side.\u201d Biden has\u00a0signed various laws and taken various actions\u00a0that have resulted in more spending than savings. These include a\u00a0massive pandemic relief law, a\u00a0bipartisan infrastructure law, a bipartisan\u00a0law\u00a0to better help veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, bipartisan foreign aid packages, and administration\u00a0efforts\u00a0to reduce student debt and\u00a0boost food stamp benefits. A June\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the\u00a0Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget concluded that \u201cPresident Biden has so far approved $6.2 trillion of gross new borrowing and $1.9 trillion of deficit reduction.\u201d Biden has repeatedly boasted that the federal budget deficit has declined during his tenure. But the\u00a0primary reason\u00a0for the decline is that the deficit had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump\u2019s term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending in fiscal 2020, then fell as expected when that spending expired under Biden. Goldwein said the Biden-era deficit reduction has been \u201clargely\u00a0in spite of\u00a0President Biden\u2019s efforts, not because of them.\u201d Biden on inflation Touting progress against inflation, Biden\u00a0claimed, \u201cIt was 9% when I got [inaudible].It\u2019s down to 3%.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s \u201cit was 9%\u201d claim was misleading at best \u2013 and the claim would be flat false if the president finished the claim the way he\u00a0did twice in May, when he said inflation was 9% when he took over.\u00a0In fact, the inflation rate was\u00a01.4% in January 2021, the month Biden was inaugurated as president, and did not hit 9% until June 2022, after he had been president for more than 16 months. The June 2024 inflation rate\u00a0was indeed 3%, and Biden could fairly tout the decline over the last two years. But he keeps claiming, or at least suggesting as he did here, that he inherited 9% inflation from Trump. That\u2019s not true. Biden on being a young senator Asked about his age, Biden\u00a0talked about\u00a0how he was once considered \u201ctoo young\u201d to be in government. He then repeated a biographical claim he has\u00a0made\u00a0on numerous previous occasions: \u201cI was the second-youngest man in the history of the Senate to get elected.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim is false. He was the\u00a0sixth-youngest man\u00a0to become a US senator, not the second youngest, when he was sworn in at age 30 and about 1\u00bd months in 1973. FactCheck.org has previously reported that Biden was the second-youngest senator from Delaware, not for the country as a whole.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-israel-immigration-spending/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_joe-biden-las-vegas", "text": "Returning to the campaign trail for the first time after an assassination attempt on his predecessor, President Joe Biden is expected to point to policies \u2013 not personality \u2013 to make the case against former President Donald Trump. In advance of public events in Nevada on Tuesday, Biden unveiled new actions to lower housing costs, including a plan to cap rents charged by certain landlords. Officials say the moves are aimed at easing a significant financial burden felt by voters. But it also allows Biden to sell voters on the substance of his proposals, instead of attacking his rival\u2019s morals and bellicose personality. The Biden campaign \u2013 and the president himself \u2013 have pledged to stay away from more divisive rhetoric in the wake of an assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally that took the life of one attendee and injured two others. Biden told NBC News that he meant to \u201cfocus on him, focus on what he\u2019s doing\u201d when he referenced putting Trump in a bullseye during a call with donors, even as he slammed Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the 2020 election outcome and other campaign trail rhetoric. During the interview with Lester Holt, Biden conceded that using the term \u201cbullseye\u201d was a mistake. A senior adviser told CNN the campaign\u2019s directive was to use discretion on all Trump-related matters \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d\u00a0The Biden campaign and White House immediately took action after Trump was injured at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, pulling down TV ads, pausing outgoing political communications and postponing the president\u2019s trip to Texas on Monday. Biden on Tuesday will participate in an interview with BET, deliver remarks at the 115th\u00a0NAACP National Convention and join Black lawmakers at a summit to discuss economic initiatives. Housing costs have been a particular point of financial pain for many Americans during Biden\u2019s term when the cost of shelter rose more than 20%. The events will be closely watched as Biden had been fighting off increasing calls for him to leave the race after his debate performance last month. CNN reported Monday that private efforts to nudge Biden out of the race continue in Democratic circles, but Biden said in a separate interview that he was \u201c1,000%\u201d in the race.  A memo written by the Biden campaign\u2019s Nevada communications director, writes that \u201cNevadans want lower costs,\u201d which it argues the Trump-associated Project 2025 agenda won\u2019t generate. Trump has floated his own policy proposals geared toward winning support from Silver State voters.\u00a0At a rally in Nevada, which has the highest share of tipped workers in the country, Trump floated a policy to stop taxing tips that workers receive. Since then, Nevada\u2019s two Democratic senators have co-sponsored a Republican bill to do that. And Trump told the\u00a0Las Vegas Review-Journal in an interview\u00a0that he supported releasing federal land to develop more affordable housing \u2013 one of the elements of the policy rollout Biden will announce Tuesday. Biden carried Nevada in 2020 by nearly three points. Polls now show that a Republican could\u00a0win Nevada for the first time in 20 years, a shift Biden is trying to thwart. To deepen the engagement voters in the state, Biden campaign offices in Latino and Black neighborhoods in Nevada offer residents events with entertainment and connect them to resources for free housing assistance and free mammograms. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like constituent relations,\u201d a senior campaign official told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re establishing real roots in the community.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee, Donald Judd and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/joe-biden-las-vegas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The\u00a0attempted\u00a0assassination of Trump \u201creinforces our assessment that election-related targets are under a heightened threat\u201d of attack or disruption, the documents states. National security and law enforcement officials have been on edge since Saturday, when a gunman identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks fired at Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania,\u00a0striking the former president in the ear and killing one spectator and critically injuring two others. The new intelligence bulletin does not identify a specific or credible threat of an attack. However, the document says: \u201cWe cannot rule out the possibility\u201d that some domestic violent extremists or other people may attempt follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence in response to the attempted assassination of Trump. Intelligence assessments like the bulletin are routine in the aftermath of major security incidents. Politico first\u00a0reported\u00a0on the bulletin. There is also a general concern among law enforcement officials that extremists will step up attempts to disrupt or attack election-related infrastructure during the 2024 election cycle. Domestic violent extremists \u201cacross ideologies are likely to view\u201d a wide range of entities associated with elections as \u201cviable targets for violence,\u201d the bulletin says. \u201cLone actors\u201d or domestic violent extremists \u201coperating in small cells\u201d likely will continue to view publicly accessible locations like political rallies and campaign events as \u201cattractive targets,\u201d the bulletin adds. Some of the tactics aimed at election officials that law enforcement is concerned about include hoax bomb threats, the leaking of officials\u2019 personal information online, and \u201cswatting,\u201d in which a caller makes a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. \u201cWe remain concerned that the use of these tactics will increase,\u201d the bulletin says. The new threat assessment comes as the Republican National Convention continues this week in Milwaukee. The convention could be an \u201cattractive\u201d target for violent extremists looking to sow chaos by disrupting a high-profile political event, federal agencies\u00a0said\u00a0in a previous assessment.

A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
