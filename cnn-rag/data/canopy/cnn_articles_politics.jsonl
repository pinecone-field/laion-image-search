{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_matt-gaetz-house-ethics-committee", "text": "The House Ethics Committee announced Tuesday that it will continue to investigate certain allegations surrounding Rep. Matt Gaetz, including whether the Florida Republican engaged in sexual misconduct, while ending other portions of the probe. In a rare statement updating\u00a0its\u00a0work, the bipartisan committee stated some of the allegations against Gaetz \u201cmerit continued review\u201d and\u00a0it has\u00a0\u201calso identified additional allegations\u201d that warrant investigating. The panel will continue to investigate allegations that Gaetz may have\u00a0\u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\u201d The panel will no longer investigate the allegations that he \u201cmay have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\u201d The largely secretive panel gave more insight into why it put out a lengthy statement in the middle of its investigation. \u201cThere has been a significant and unusual amount of public reporting on the Committee\u2019s activities this Congress.\u00a0Much of that reporting has been inaccurate.\u00a0The Committee\u2019s investigations are conducted confidentially, but the Committee\u2019s confidentiality rules do not prohibit witnesses from disclosing information about the Committee\u2019s requests or conversations with Committee investigators,\u201d the statement read. The committee also disclosed it has spoken with \u201cmore than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents in this matter.\u201d CNN has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that the panel has reached out to the woman whom the congressman\u00a0allegedly had sexual relations with\u00a0when she was a 17-year-old\u00a0minor, according to a source familiar with the committee\u2019s work. The panel is also\u00a0trying\u00a0to get information from the Department of Justice about its now-closed probe that did not result in charges against Gaetz, as CNN has reported. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex. Ahead of the announcement from the Ethics Committee, Gaetz\u00a0called\u00a0the new investigations \u201cfrivolous\u201d and claimed, \u201cThey are doing this to avoid the obvious fact that every investigation into me ends the same way: my exoneration.\u201d Gaetz, who led the charge to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has\u00a0privately blamed\u00a0the California Republican for the committee restarting its probe under his tenure. \u201cThis is Soviet. Kevin McCarthy showed them the man, and they are now trying to find the crime. I work for Northwest Floridians who won\u2019t be swayed by this nonsense and McCarthy and his goons know it,\u201d Gaetz added on Monday. But McCarthy has repeatedly denounced those accusations and has said Gaetz worked to oust him because of the ethics probe. In late 2020, under Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr, the Justice Department opened an investigation into allegations Gaetz may have had sexual contact with a minor. The probe expanded over the years before the Justice Department officially decided last year not to charge the congressman. As part of the sprawling investigation,\u00a0Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector and close confidant of Gaetz, pleaded guilty in 2021 to six federal charges, including soliciting and paying\u00a0the minor\u00a0in the Gaetz allegation\u00a0for sex. The Ethics Committee, controlled at the time by Democrats, originally\u00a0opened its Gaetz investigation in 2021,\u00a0publicly announcing that it was examining a range of allegations\u00a0including that Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, used illicit drugs, converted campaign funds to personal use and accepted a bribe, among other claims. The committee deferred its investigation at\u00a0the request of the Justice Department, which was simultaneously probing the allegations, but resumed its work after the DOJ concluded its investigation without bringing charges. A source familiar with the House panel\u2019s work\u00a0previously told\u00a0CNN that the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to bring charges against Gaetz does not impact what the committee will and won\u2019t investigate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/matt-gaetz-house-ethics-committee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_bob-good-virginia-primary-trump-gop", "text": "It\u2019s a primary election that took an MRI of the modern Republican Party \u2014 revealing toxic backstabbing, desperate lunges for Donald Trump\u2019s favor and the former president\u2019s always festering sense of betrayal. And no one knows how it will end. Rep. Bob Good \u2013 an arch conservative whom Trump is trying to bump out of Congress for disloyalty \u2013 trails his GOP challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, by just over 340 votes after Tuesday\u2019s election in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District, with about 96% of votes in. The fate of Trump\u2019s quest for revenge could ironically partly hang on mail-in ballots \u2013 a category of votes the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has often decried with his false claims of 2020 election fraud. Trump is angry at Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, because he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential race. Kevin McCarthy also showed that Virginia is for vengeance by seeking his own bounty on Good, who helped to oust the California Republican as speaker last year. Good could become the first Republican incumbent to lose a House primary to a nonincumbent this year despite his frantic efforts to win back Trump\u2019s support, which included a trip to support the former president at his hush money trial in New York. McGuire told supporters Tuesday night, \u201cI\u2019m your Republican nominee,\u201d and thanked Trump for his help, even though the race could be heading for a recount if the margin between the two candidates remains so tight and the losing candidate requests one. Good said on social media that he\u2019d held off the \u201cWashington swamp\u201d and declared the race \u201ctoo close to call.\u201d CNN has not made a projection. Defeat for Good would strangle a fast-rising congressional career born when he won a drive-thru GOP convention in a Lynchburg church parking lot during the pandemic. The staunch conservative was elected to chair the powerful Freedom Caucus in only his second term. But he authored his own demise by getting crosswise with two key forces in the riotous Republican House majority \u2014 the ex-president and McCarthy, whose still potent financial machine is on a revenge tour. But the significance of the drama in this district \u2013 an area that produced presidents James Madison and James Monroe \u2013 goes far beyond a single, thwarted political arc. It shows that the real dividing line in the GOP is no longer a question of ideology. In more normal times, it would have been hard to imagine a conservative challenger getting to the right of Good. But in the modern GOP, the true acid test of political viability is total fealty to the presumptive nominee. And this race, which was the most expensive House GOP primary of the 2024 cycle so far, will also serve as the perfect emblem of a chaotic House majority that will be remembered far more for vicious internal fights and members trampling over one another to prove their devotion to Trump than for its legislative record. Trump\u2019s intervention The ex-president has plenty of weightier worries amid a staggering confluence of legal crises following his first criminal conviction and three other indictments and with a potential second presidency to plan. But he also has a sensitive political radar that picks out even the merest hint of disloyalty. It was therefore not surprising that Trump conducted a tele-rally for McGuire on primary eve and left his supporters with no doubt about who he favored and why. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. He was against things that everybody would have wanted and always made it difficult,\u201d Trump told supporters on the call. \u201cHe just let us down, he let us down very big. \u2026 As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years and then after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that\u2019s not good enough, because those are the people that \u2013 they tend to leave you very quickly.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to drive Good out of Congress sprung from the same reflex to exert power that he showed last week. In his first visit to Capitol Hill since his mob beat up police officers and smashed their way into the House and Senate on January 6, 2021, the ex-president gathered Republican lawmakers around him in a show of homage. The image of the day was a handshake offered by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn\u2019t hidden his disdain for the former president but who has never shirked from what needs to be done for the GOP to win and retain power. While he was estranged from Trump, Good campaigned as though he and the former president were on the same side. He used signs that said: \u201cTrump, Bob Good: Keeping America Great\u201d \u2013 as he appeared alongside the former president\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, himself a former Freedom Caucus chairman. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju in March, Good dismissed questions about his backing of DeSantis, whose primary bid ended in January after a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get with the present? This is a time to rally behind President Trump,\u201d Good said. \u201cMy opponent wants to continue to divide people based on the past. We\u2019re all behind President Trump. He must win. The country can\u2019t handle four more years of Joe Biden.\u201d The passport to power in Trump\u2019s GOP McGuire displayed the behavior required of anyone who wants a future in the Trump-era GOP in an interview with \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday just before polls opened in Virginia. He attacked Good for not being loyal to the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. \u201cObviously, he bagged Trump for an endorsement in 2022. And less than a year later, when the chips were down \u2026 he endorsed a different candidate.\u201d The retired Navy SEAL also upheld the former president\u2019s claims of election fraud in 2020 by arguing that Trump was doomed by changes to voting arrangements that were introduced during the Covid-19 emergency. \u201cI would say changing the rules in the middle of the game is cheating. And I think that that Trump was robbed,\u201d McGuire said. A new law allowing no-excuse absentee voting was passed by Virginia\u2019s legislature and approved by the governor in April 2020, seven months before the election. McGuire also voiced Trump\u2019s claims that the former president is a victim of a weaponized justice system following his conviction for falsifying business records to hide a payment to a former adult film star in 2016. Trump has made similar claims about his indictments over his attempt to overturn the election in 2020 and for alleged mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but I think all Americans, we go back to trust. You know, if we don\u2019t have trust in our institutions, our country is going to fall apart. And there is evidence everywhere of a two-tiered justice system. Rules for thee, not for me,\u201d McGuire said. The candidate\u2019s willingness to submit to the modern GOP\u2019s trifecta \u2014 unflinching loyalty to Trump and acceptance of his election fraud conspiracies and legal persecution narrative could yet see him emerge as the district\u2019s GOP nominee. Good could only manage two of the three \u2014 and it could cost him his career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/bob-good-virginia-primary-trump-gop/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_trump-gag-order-new-york-appeal", "text": "New York\u2019s highest court has declined to hear Donald Trump\u2019s appeal on the gag order in his hush money case, according to a\u00a0decision list\u00a0posted Tuesday. The gag order, issued by Judge Juan Merchan in the criminal case against Trump, remains in effect. Separately, Trump has asked Merchan to terminate the gag order ahead of his sentencing scheduled for July. The former president was convicted of 34 counts of business fraud relating to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche declined to comment. In March, just before the trial started,\u00a0Merchan\u00a0granted prosecutors\u2019 request for a gag order that precluded Trump from making public statements about any witnesses in the case, jurors, prosecutors, court staff, or members of their family. Trump was not restricted from commenting on\u00a0the judge\u00a0or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Merchan\u00a0fined Trump $10,000 and found him in criminal contempt for violating the gag order 10 times early in the trial and raised the prospect that he might have to jail Trump if he continued to do so. Trump has 30 days to file a motion for leave to appeal, which is another avenue by which the court could end up hearing the case, according to court spokesman Gary Spencer. Once that motion is filed, the court will again make a decision on whether to hear the case. In their filing with the appeals court, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued that the case presents \u201csubstantial constitutional questions of the highest importance.\u201d \u201cThis Gag Order restricts President Trump\u2019s core political speech on matters of central importance at the height of his Presidential campaign, where he is the leading candidate, and thus it violates the fundamental right of every American voter to hear from the leading candidate for President on matters of enormous public importance,\u201d his attorneys wrote. Trump\u2019s lawyers said that the case still presents substantial constitutional questions even though the trial has ended, adding that the gag order does not include a set termination date. If the Court of Appeals did find the gag order unconstitutional, Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote it would \u201cundermine the justification\u201d for the fines Trump received for his violations. In their own filing, Bragg\u2019s office urged the court to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Trump has a \u201cwell-documented history of leveling threatening, inflammatory, and denigrating remarks against trial participants.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/trump-gag-order-new-york-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Biden administration officials have worked with the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) to restore\u00a0the\u00a0program,\u00a0which allows Gold Star families to have flowers placed on their loved one\u2019s grave at US military cemeteries abroad. \u201cThe White House worked with the ABMC and this program will now be re-established,\u201d the official said. It is expected to be included in the coming budget year. For years, Gold Star families who lost loved ones in battle could pay for flowers and have the ABMC deliver them to the grave of their fallen family members in, say, Normandy. That program ended in 2015. On the 80th anniversary of D-Day,  CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d reported on the loss of the program. Rondy Elliott, a Gold Star daughter, lost her father, Corporal Frank Elliott, during the Normandy invasion 80 years ago. \u201cThis is my father\u2019s grave in Normandy with flowers,\u201d she told CNN, holding up a photograph showing that image from years before. \u201cPeople walk into the cemeteries; they see these flowers and they know that there\u2019s somebody at home that still cares about that soldier.\u201d A White House official told CNN that the Biden administration had seen CNN\u2019s reporting, and said that \u201cbecause of how deep and personal this is to the president, the White House acted quickly. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients directed the team to pull all levers to get this program running and stayed on top of it personally to make sure it was done.\u201d Retired Marine General John Kelly, who helped bring the cause to CNN\u2019s attention, said Wednesday that \u201cthis decision to reinstate the flowers program is simply the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cI know the Gold Star Families from every conflict will rejoice at this decision. Families who carry in their hearts every minute of every day the sadness of having lost one so precious, but also carry in their hearts the intense pride in their sacrifice that never goes away,\u201d Kelly said. The White House official cautioned that \u201cit will take time for the ABMC to reestablish the program after it being dismantled for about a decade,\u201d though they \u201cexpect it to be up and running some time in Fiscal Year 2025 (this coming budget year starting this October) and we will work with the ABMC to get it online as fast as possible.\u201d Americans, Kelly told CNN, owe service members \u201ceverything.\u201d \u201cThe men and women who serve in the forces that guard our country and our way of life \u2013particularly the million plus who since the birth of our Republic willingly sacrificed their lives for us \u2013 are selfless heroes,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt does not matter if they are buried in Arlington, in any one of our 26 military cemeteries around the globe, lost at sea, or buried in local hometown cemeteries across America. They deserve to be remembered by every citizen of our great nation.\u201d \u201cThey earned it by their actions on the battlefield. If, God forbid, we ever forget them shame on us.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_blinken-confirms-pause-heavy-bombs-israel", "text": "US\u00a0Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday confirmed an ongoing pause on a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to ratchet up public pressure on the Biden administration over \u201cwithholding weapons.\u201d The Biden administration is \u201ccontinuing to review one shipment that President Biden has talked about with regard to 2,000-pound bombs because of our concerns about their use in a densely populated area like Rafah. That remains under review,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. The administration is committed, however, to making sure that \u201cthat Israel has what it needs to effectively defend itself,\u201d Blinken said. The pause in the shipment of the heavy bombs was made public in early May, months into\u00a0the war between\u00a0Israel\u00a0and\u00a0Hamas as the administration faced heavy domestic scrutiny over its provision of weapons to the Israeli military. It served as a signal of the kind of action President Joe Biden said he was prepared to take if Israel moved forward with a major military operation in Rafah, the southern Gazan city where more than a million people had fled. The announcement of the hold on the weapons shipment was met with mixed reactions, including strong condemnation from Israeli officials and some US lawmakers of both parties. In video remarks Tuesday, Netanyahu \u2013 who will address the US Congress next month \u2013 seemed to try to revive public pressure around the pause, claiming that he told Blinken in their meeting in Israel last week that \u201cit\u2019s inconceivable that in the past few months, the administration has been withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel.\u201d \u201cSecretary Blinken assured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks,\u201d he said in the brief video posted on X. It is unclear what other weapons Netanyahu was referencing. Blinken would not say whether he made such an assurance to Netanyahu, telling reporters at the press conference Tuesday that he was \u201cnot going to talk about what we said in diplomatic conversations.\u201d \u201cI can just say, again, that we have a commitment to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against a whole variety of threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to move these different cases through our system on regular order,\u201d Blinken said, noting that \u201cit takes a long time to move these things, and a number of the things that are going to Israel won\u2019t get there for years.\u201d US officials have argued that Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah, which have added to the civilian death toll and caused further displacement, do not represent major\u00a0military operations and as such, they have not instituted further holds on weapons. And the US has moved forward with a number of other arms sales and transfers to Israel over the course of the eight months of\u00a0the war. In mid-May, just weeks after the pause was announced, the administration began the early stages of a process to move ahead with a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel. On Tuesday, CNN reported that key Democratic lawmakers had lifted holds on an expected $18 billion sale of F-15 fighter jets to Israel.

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_campaign-biden-trump-supreme-court-race-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is directly trying to exploit Donald Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in a significant new campaign gambit ahead of their pivotal debate clash next week. The Biden campaign on Monday debuted a new ad that will air in battleground states that blasts the presumptive Republican nominee as a felon who only cares about himself. The strategy appears to resolve a debate among Democrats about how overtly they should highlight the ex-president\u2019s legal woes in a neck and neck White House race. The new front in the 2024 campaign opened up after Trump sought to win votes among Black Americans, a traditional Democratic power base where the ex-president is\u00a0trying to make inroads\u00a0despite\u00a0his\u00a0tarnished\u00a0personal history\u00a0on\u00a0race. This comes as Republicans embrace their presumptive nominee despite his\u00a0conviction and bid to overturn the 2020 election result, going all in on Trump as they seek to win back the White House and the Senate and keep the House. Biden\u2019s new ad zeroes in directly on the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial and his huge loss in a civil fraud case to strike a sharp contrast with Biden\u2019s character.\u00a0As the ex-president\u2019s mug shot flashes on screen, a narrator says: \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who\u2019s only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The ad marks the Biden campaign\u2019s most explicit strategic use so far of Trump\u2019s legal woes in a campaign message. Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu explained the thinking on CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d: \u201cWhat this ad is about is about showing the American people about the issue that\u2019s going to decide this campaign: wisdom, courage, character.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign responded by blasting the hush money trial as \u201celection interference\u201d and highlighted polls showing the former president\u2019s strength in swing states. \u201cThe contrast between President Trump\u2019s strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson, wrote on X. Biden, who flew directly from his second trip to Europe within a week to a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday, argued there that one of the \u201cscariest\u201d parts of a second Trump term would be a possibility that his rival could appoint more hardline conservative Supreme Court justices. Former President Barack Obama, who joined his former vice president at the fundraiser, meanwhile bemoaned the fact that Republicans are set to nominate a candidate who was \u201cconvicted by a jury of his peers on 34 counts.\u201d Candidates position themselves for first presidential debate The campaign is intensifying ahead of 2024\u2019s first presidential debate, on CNN on June 27, a potentially defining moment of a campaign that could see an ex-president beat the sitting president who ousted him from office for only the second time in history. The showdown in Atlanta will take place with 81-year-old Biden under extreme pressure to show he\u2019s up to another four-year term amid pervasive voter concerns about his advanced years and following Trump\u2019s incessant mockery of the visibly aging president\u2019s mental acuity and physical state. The ex-president\u2019s constant ridiculing of Biden\u2019s faculties may, however, be lowering expectations for Biden\u2019s performance, raising the prospect that an energetic showing from the president could have a similar impact to his barnstorming State of the Union address this year, which temporarily quieted concerns over his age. The ex-president\u2019s volatile behavior in recent days, including after he marked his 78th birthday on Friday, is prompting the Biden campaign to argue that Trump\u2019s state of mind \u2014 as well as his attempt to crush American democracy four years ago \u2014\u00a0means he\u2019s unfit for a return to office. Last week, the campaign described Trump as \u201cmore unhinged than ever before\u201d after he returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since the January 6, 2021, mob attack to be embraced by House and Senate GOP lawmakers. The first presidential debate of this campaign is unusually early, meaning it could give the president a chance to jolt a toss-up White House race that has been largely stable for months. Trump is polling strongly in key swing states. Biden is apparently clinging to a narrowing path through the countrywide electoral map to the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. The president is being hampered by the pain felt by many Americans over high prices and elevated interest rates that have made it hard to afford new homes and car loans \u2014 giving Trump an opening to conjure nostalgia about the pre-pandemic economy during his term in office. CNN on Saturday announced new details for the debate, agreed to by both campaigns. The event will take place in a television studio rather than in front of a live audience. It will include two commercial breaks, during which campaign staff will be barred from interacting with their candidate. Both men agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their positions will be determined by a coin flip. Microphones will be muted except when it\u2019s a candidate\u2019s turn to speak. Biden is expected to head to Camp David later this week for an intense debate camp that will involve his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, who has been schooling Democratic candidates ahead of debates for decades. Trump held a policy forum with a group of advisers and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri when he was in Washington last week. His aides insisted that the ex-president would not necessarily engage in traditional debate prep but rely on interviews and rallies to hone his approach. However, Trump\u2019s interviews, mostly with conservative media, are often full of softball questions. And he skipped all the GOP primary debates, so he might not be fully prepared when Biden gets in his grille. Trump seeks to fracture Biden\u2019s support among Black voters In a race that will turn on a handful of swing states that could be decided by mere thousands of votes, any chunks either candidate can take from the other\u2019s core constituency could be crucial. This is why Trump spent Saturday in Michigan, seeking to take advantage of signs of waning enthusiasm for Biden among Black voters. The former president unveiled his \u201cBlack Americans for Trump\u201d coalition, which has the support of prominent Black Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. In a Friday interview with Semafor, Trump declared, \u201cI\u2019m not racist.\u201d He added: \u201cI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldn\u2019t be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,\u201d he said. Speaking at a predominately Black church in Detroit on Saturday, Trump falsely claimed that Black workers did far better in his first term than under Biden in an effort to leverage the cornerstone of his campaign \u2014 immigration \u2014 into an appeal to minorities he claims are losing their jobs to undocumented migrants. He is also highlighting Biden\u2019s role as a senator in passing a 1990s crime bill that resulted in high rates of incarceration among Black citizens. According to CNN exit polls in 2020, Trump won about 1 in 10 Black voters. But a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found the ex-president winning more than 20% of Black voters in battleground states. If he can depress Biden\u2019s advantage among the key demographic in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, Trump could improve his chances of winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, states that form Biden\u2019s best path to keep the White House. The Biden campaign hit back at Trump\u2019s appeal to a reliable core constituency that helped lift Biden to the presidency, highlighting controversies, including Trump\u2019s demand for the death penalty against five youths who were wrongly convicted of an assault and rape in Central Park in the 1980s and his racist campaign over Obama\u2019s birthplace. \u201cWe sure haven\u2019t forgotten Trump repeatedly cozying up to white supremacists and demonizing Black communities to his political benefit \u2014 because that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019ll do if he wins a second term,\u201d said Jasmine Harris, the director of Black media for the Biden campaign. Obama also took a shot at the presumptive GOP nominee when asked by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel at the Los Angeles fundraiser what he thought about Trump\u2019s claims that he\u2019d done more for Black people than any president in history. The former commander in chief replied: \u201cOne thing he did, for example, was make them feel even better about the first Black president.\u201d Biden slams \u2018out of kilter\u2019 Supreme Court majority Political fundraisers are often closed. But the Biden campaign seemed keen to show the president in an informal setting with Obama and stars including Julia Roberts and George Clooney. The president stopped in Washington only to refuel Air Force One on the way home from the G7 summit in Italy before the event, which came days after his surviving son, Hunter Biden, was found guilty on gun charges following a trial in Delaware. The president\u2019s campaign on Sunday released a video from the fundraiser in which Biden referenced the controversy surrounding flags raised by Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s wife that critics have warned are politically provocative. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019s going to appoint two more flying flags upside down,\u201d Biden said. Asked by Kimmel whether he considered this the scariest part of a second Trump term, Biden responded, \u201cIt is one of the scariest parts.\u201d The president added: \u201cThe Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today, I mean never.\u201d For years before the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, Republicans put the destiny of the nation\u2019s top court at the center of their presidential election campaigns. Biden gave the clearest indication yet this weekend that Democrats are now desperate to play on the same turf.

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_senate-bump-stock-ban-bill", "text": "Senate Republicans on Tuesday blocked an attempt by Democrats to pass a bill to ban bump stocks in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling. The bill\u00a0would enact a federal ban on the sale of bump stock devices. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute. The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday\u00a0struck down\u00a0a federal ban on bump stocks approved by former President Donald Trump, the latest opinion from the conservative court rolling back firearm regulations. While some Republicans support a ban on bump stocks, the issue has divided GOP senators in the aftermath of the high court ruling. On Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico made a request on the Senate floor for unanimous consent to pass the bill and Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska objected, calling it a \u201cshow vote.\u201d \u201cAs a firearms owner myself, there\u2019s no legitimate use for a bump stock \u2013 not for self defense, not in a law enforcement context, not even in military applications \u2026 but what they are tailor made for is a mass shooting,\u201d Heinrich said, noting that the bill he was seeking to pass has bipartisan support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also spoke on the floor in support of a ban. \u201cThe Senate must step into the breach and pass a federal ban on bump stocks,\u201d Schumer said, calling it a \u201ccommonsense safety measure.\u201d Criticizing the bill as overreach, Ricketts said, \u201cThis bill would ban literally any item that makes a firearm easier and in some cases safer to shoot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not really about bump stocks, this bill is about banning as many firearm accessories as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unconstitutional attack on law-abiding gun owners.\u201d Earlier this week,\u00a0several senior Republican senators expressed a tentative openness to legislation restricting the use of bump stocks, but others\u00a0argued it wasn\u2019t a good idea. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \u201cno,\u201d he does not support any legislation restricting or banning bump stocks \u2013 a significant block to any potential bill. \u201cThe court ruling was accurate,\u201d he added. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is running for Senate GOP leader, told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in some negotiations regarding firearms, and I\u2019d be happy to listen to what people propose.\u201d Asked if it is a good idea for Congress to act, he was cautious: \u201cI need to see what they want to do.\u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia also didn\u2019t rule out supporting bump stocks legislation. \u201cI think my understanding of the decision is the Congress has to act on this. So we\u2019ll see if somebody brings something forward, and then I\u2019ll look at it then,\u201d she said. Across the aisle, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he would check in with Republicans who may be interested in bump stocks legislation to see if there could be a path forward. Murphy said it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to get a deal in this political climate, but he noted there are plenty of Republicans who have said bump stocks should be banned.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/senate-bump-stock-ban-bill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_arizona-private-school-vouchers-invs", "text": "Near the edge of the Phoenix metro\u2019s urban sprawl, surrounded by a wide expanse of saguaro-studded scrubland, Dream City Christian School is in the midst of a major expansion. The private school, which is affiliated with a local megachurch where former President Donald Trump held a campaign rally this month, recently broke ground on a new wing that will feature modern, airy classrooms and a pickleball court. It\u2019s a sign of growth at a school that has partnered with a Trump-aligned advocacy group, and advertises to parents by vowing to fight \u201cliberal ideology\u201d such as \u201cevolutionism\u201d and \u201cgender identification.\u201d Just a few miles away, the public Paradise Valley Unified School District is shrinking, not expanding. The district shuttered three of its schools last month\u00a0amid falling enrollment, a cost-saving measure that has disrupted life for hundreds of families. One of the factors behind Dream City\u2019s success and Paradise Valley\u2019s struggles: In Arizona, taxpayer dollars that previously went to public schools like the ones that closed are increasingly flowing to private schools \u2013 including those that adopt a right-wing philosophy. Arizona was the first state in the country to enact a universal \u201ceducation savings account\u201d program \u2013\u00a0a form of voucher that allows any family to take tax dollars that would have gone to their child\u2019s public education and spend the money instead on private schooling. A CNN investigation found that the program has cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than anticipated, disproportionately benefited richer areas, and funneled taxpayer funds to unregulated private schools that don\u2019t face the same educational standards and antidiscrimination protections that public schools do.\u00a0Since Arizona\u2019s expanded program took effect in 2022, according to state data, it has sent nearly $2 million\u00a0to Dream City and likely sapped millions of dollars from Paradise Valley\u2019s budget. And Arizona is hardly alone: universal voucher programs are sweeping Republican-led states, making it one of the right\u2019s most successful efforts to rewrite state policy after decades of setbacks. The cause has been bolstered by a small group of billionaires who\u00a0have quietly spent millions of dollars on election campaigns and lobbying to push vouchers around the country. Supporters argue that the programs give families greater freedom in choosing their children\u2019s schools, and help less affluent kids in failing public schools achieve\u00a0a better education. Critics say the problems in Arizona are a warning of potential dangers as other states follow its lead. \u201cWe\u2019re the canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Trevor Nelson, an education activist and a parent in the Paradise Valley district where public schools are closing. \u201cWe\u2019re on the front lines, and what happens here is going to dictate what happens in the rest of the country.\u201d A national movement transforming America\u2019s education system For decades, conservative activists and politicians have been pushing policies to make it easier for families to spend taxpayer funds on private education. Various states passed small, targeted voucher programs for low-income students, or students with disabilities. But efforts to expand vouchers to all families, regardless of their incomes, failed again and again, defeated in voter referendums or rejected by state legislatures and courts. That changed swiftly in recent years. Since 2021, nearly a dozen states have passed universal or near-universal school choice policies \u2013 either vouchers that directly send public dollars to private schools, or similar \u201ceducation savings account\u201d programs that give parents more flexibility on where to spend the money. \u201cThere\u2019s been more gains made in the last few years of the school choice movement than there were in the prior 30,\u201d said Tommy Schultz, the CEO of the pro-voucher American Federation for Children, said in an interview. \u201cWe are basically hitting a tipping point when it comes to giving families education freedom.\u201d The political calculus on vouchers changed amid the impact of school closings during the coronavirus pandemic and vitriolic debates over public school teachings on race and sexuality. Pro-voucher advocates embraced those culture war fights, refocusing their efforts on red states where they painted public schools as out of step with parents\u2019 values. Half of Republicans polled told Gallup in 2022 that they had very little or no confidence in public schools, up from 31% in 2019. The American Federation for Children, which was previously led by\u00a0Trump\u2019s Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, pushed vouchers in part by playing a big role in state legislative races. AFC ran ads attacking Republicans who opposed universal ESA expansion bills \u2013 often rural legislators whose constituents were more likely to rely on public schools \u2013 in states like Iowa, Tennessee, Texas and elsewhere. Schultz said the group targeted 71 incumbents around the country in 2022, and 40 of them lost their elections. This year, AFC plans to be involved in \u201chundreds\u201d of races, he said.\u00a0 AFC\u2019s national political arm has spent\u00a0more than $7 million since 2020 after receiving $3 million from DeVos and her husband, $2 million from TikTok investor Jeff Yass, and $1.75 million from Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and his wife, according to IRS records. DeVos and Haslam did not respond to requests for comment, while Yass said in a statement that \u201cschool choice is the civil rights issue of our time and I\u2019m excited to see the issue getting the attention it deserves.\u201d AFC said it has also spent an additional $16 million through affiliated state political action committees and other groups. In an internal presentation obtained by the progressive watchdog group Documented and provided to CNN, AFC boasted that it had \u201cdeployed\u201d $250 million \u201cto advance school choice over the last 13 years,\u201d and that that spending had led to \u201c$25+ billion in government funding directed towards student choice.\u201d\u00a0Those numbers are now even higher, Schultz said. Charles Siler, an Arizona political consultant who worked as a lobbyist for two pro-voucher nonprofits before coming to oppose school privatization, said the recent victories for school choice were the result of a long, methodical effort by groups like AFC. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an overnight success, this is decades in intentional, strategic labor,\u201d Siler said. \u201cAt a certain point you\u2019ll hit a tipping point where public schools cannot afford to function.\u201d The push for universal vouchers comes as the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings that bolstered state funding for religious schools. In 2002, the court ruled that states could create tuition voucher programs for religious schools, opening the door to programs like Arizona\u2019s. Two decades later, in 2022, the court expanded that decision by ruling that states that give vouchers to private schools cannot withhold them from religious schools. Advocates for student choice argue that voucher programs lead to increases in student achievement. But several other studies have found that expansions of vouchers in some states had a negative impact on student test scores \u2013 as opposed to smaller, targeted programs. One reason is that when voucher programs are universal or near-universal, more money goes to less academically rigorous schools, said Josh Cowen, a Michigan State University professor who\u2019s written a book on school vouchers. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the school in \u2018Dead Poets Society\u2019 here,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about schools run out of church basements.\u201d Arizona led the way in universal vouchers Arizona has long been ground zero in the fight over public support for private schools. The Grand Canyon State first adopted its \u201cEmpowerment Scholarship Account\u201d program in 2011 for families of students with disabilities. State leaders gradually expanded the program over the years, adding in military families, students in low-performing public schools, and other groups. But initial efforts to allow any family in the state to take advantage of the program floundered. In 2018, nearly two-thirds of Arizona voters rejected a universal ESA bill in a referendum. And when GOP Gov. Doug Ducey pushed the policy again in 2021, three Republican members of the state house joined Democrats to block it. Those three holdouts were targeted by YouTube ads paid for by the American Federation for Children, according to Google\u2019s political ad database. When the legislature again considered a universal ESA bill in 2022, all three members flipped to support it,\u00a0and Ducey signed it into law. Since the new rules went into effect in September 2022, Arizona\u2019s ESA program has grown from 12,000 students to about 75,000.\u00a0Families can spend the state money their  public school district would have received for their child\u2019s education on private school or homeschooling. Most students receive about $7,000, while those with disabilities get significantly more. Tom Horne, the Arizona superintendent of public instruction and a Republican elected official who supports the ESA program, argued that it gives families much-needed flexibility. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to empower parents to choose the school that best suits their child\u2019s needs,\u201d Horne said. \u201cNo one could rationally be against that unless they are so immersed in ideology, and it has made them coldhearted with respect to students\u2019 academic needs.\u201d But unlike some other states that have adopted voucher programs, Arizona has no standards requiring private schools to be accredited or licensed by the state, or follow all but the most basic curriculum standards. That means there is no way to compare test scores in public schools to students in the ESA program. \u201cThere\u2019s zero accreditation, there\u2019s zero accountability, and there\u2019s zero transparency,\u201d said Beth Lewis, a former teacher who leads an Arizona nonprofit that advocates against school privatization. The state also allows families to spend the money not just on schools but on a wide variety of items that could be considered educational for homeschooled kids. Parents have been approved to use the taxpayer dollars to buy their children things like kayaks, trampolines, cowboy roping lessons and SeaWorld tickets. Horne said his office was now rejecting some purchases that would have been approved under previous administrations. The program is costing considerably more than originally anticipated. When the bill to expand vouchers to all students passed in 2022, the legislature\u2019s budget committee estimated that it would only cost the state $64.5 million between July 2023 and June 2024, while noting that there was uncertainty about that figure. But far more students joined the program than projected, and the universal expansion has actually cost the state about $332 million over the last year, a report released this month by the nonpartisan Grand Canyon Institute estimated. The cost increases come as the state has grappled with a significant budget deficit. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed limiting voucher eligibility and mandating minimum educational standards and background checks at private schools receiving ESA money \u2013 but those proposals have gone nowhere in the GOP-controlled legislature. One big reason why the program is costing so much: About half of the students participating never attended a public or charter school, according to the Arizona Department of Education, so the state had not been previously paying for their education. And only about a third of students in the program came directly from a public or charter school. Wealthy communities are disproportionately benefiting, according to a CNN analysis of state education department and US Census data. Almost a third of the students whose families are receiving ESA funding live in zip codes with median household incomes of more than $100,000 \u2013 even though only a fifth of the minors in the state live in those zip codes. \u201cYou\u2019re enabling doctors, lawyers, bankers, management consultants who already had their children in private schools to get this subsidy that they were not entitled to before,\u201d said Samuel E. Abrams, the director of a University of Colorado research center on school privatization. \u201cThis is costing taxpayers a lot of money that wasn\u2019t anticipated.\u201d Schools accused of discrimination getting taxpayer funds Some of the private schools that are among those receiving the most money from Arizona\u2019s ESA program have extreme beliefs or have been accused of discriminating against students. State records that CNN obtained through a public records request, which have not been previously reported, show that about half of the money that went to private schools through the ESA program last year went to religious schools, the vast majority of which were Christian. Some of the Christian schools that have raked in the most taxpayer funds publish \u201cstatements of faith\u201d on their websites mandating that teachers and staff agree to declarations such as \u201crejection of one\u2019s biological sex is a rejection of the image of God within that person\u201d and that \u201chomosexual behavior\u201d is \u201coffensive to God.\u201d Dream City Christian School, the megachurch-affiliated school that is expanding, received more than $1.3 million in ESA funding in 2023 \u2013 10 times what it was receiving before the universal expansion passed, and more than 95% of the private schools that received funding. The school operates a partnership with the advocacy group Turning Point USA, which works to organize conservative students on high school and college campuses. On its website, Dream City encourages applications by declaring that it will \u201cprotect our campus from the infiltration of unethical agendas by rejecting all \u2018woke\u2019 and untruthful ideologies being pushed on students.\u201d\u00a0The school did not respond to requests for comment. Dream City is just one example of Turning Point\u2019s efforts to build a network of conservative Christian schools. During a recent video info session, Turning Point executives described how the program was \u201crestoring God as the foundation of our education\u201d at a time when \u201cexposure to all of the secular, really godless ideologies is on the rise.\u201d On the other side of the Phoenix metro area, the private Valley Christian Schools received nearly $1.1 million in ESA funding last year despite facing allegations of LGBTQ discrimination in federal court. Valley Christian fired high school English teacher Adam McDorman after he voiced support for a student who came out as pansexual, McDorman alleged in a 2022 lawsuit. In an email\u00a0that McDorman provided to CNN, the school\u2019s then-principal argued that the idea that it was possible to be both \u201chomosexual or otherwise sexually deviant and also a Christian\u201d was a \u201chideous lie.\u201d Public schools are barred from discriminating against students because of characteristics like their religion or sexuality, but no such rules cover private schools. In court documents, Valley Christian lawyers have argued that the school had the religious liberty to fire McDorman.\u00a0The school declined to comment because the case is pending. In an interview, McDorman said his former school taught creationism as a scientific fact, and \u201cwhitewashed\u201d American history to downplay the harms of slavery. He was surprised to learn about the level of public funding it was receiving. \u201cThat amount of money is pretty staggering,\u201d McDorman said.\u00a0\u201cThey have so much taxpayer support \u2013 and no responsibility to treat their students with equal respect.\u201d Public schools closing in Arizona Even as Arizona\u2019s voucher expansion is draining money from the state budget and diverting it to conservative religious schools, critics say one of the most damaging long-term impacts could be the impact on public schools. More than 24,000 students have directly left public or charter schools to join the ESA program, according to state data \u2013 taking with them hundreds of millions of dollars that previously flowed to those schools each year. Even small reductions in enrollment can destabilize school budgets in Arizona, which spends less per-student on public education than nearly any other state in the US. Fewer students means less money coming in, while many fixed costs remain the same. \u201cWhen kids leave those classrooms for private schools, bills still have to get paid, heaters have to stay on, buses have to run, teacher salaries remain present,\u201d Cowen, the Michigan State professor, said. \u201cSo those schools do take a hit.\u201d The Paradise Valley district, which covers a swath of northern Phoenix and the suburb of Scottsdale, closed two elementary schools and a middle school this year, with students leaving for the final time last month. Two of the three schools had an A rating in the state\u2019s student performance letter grades, a distinction only about a third of Arizona schools have received. The district has seen declining enrollment for years, as rising house prices have reduced the numbers of families moving in, and new charter schools and private schools have opened in the surrounding area. Horne, the state superintendent, said that the \u201coccasional need to close a district school due to population shifts and other natural demographic trends is a decades-old phenomenon\u201d not related to the ESA program. But school district officials say the expansion of universal ESA\u2019s also played a role in reducing enrollment, along with the other factors.\u00a0According to state data, 456 students have directly left Paradise Valley public schools to join the ESA program \u2013 more than the  enrollment at two of the three schools that closed. In addition, there are about 2,500 other students living in the district who are in the ESA program. The reduction in funds from students leaving for ESA\u2019s \u2013 and the potential of more departures going forward \u2013 put the district \u201cover the edge\u201d of having to close three schools at once, argued Nelson, the local education activist. While students and staff at the shuttered schools are being offered places at other schools in the district, the closings have been met with sadness and anger among some in the community. School board meetings were at times contentious, with local residents railing against the closures and parents holding rallies outside schools set to be shuttered. Last month, dozens of former students and teachers gathered in the school gymnasium of one of the closing schools, Sunset Canyon Elementary, to say goodbye. As kids ran around and marveled at old yearbook photos, teachers exchanged hugs with students they\u2019d taught years or decades ago. Susie Francis, who has taught at Sunset Canyon since it first opened its doors in 1999, said it felt surreal for the school to be closing. \u201cThis school is so much more than just a building to people, it\u2019s a home,\u201d Francis said, holding back tears. \u201cSo many students have touched my heart over the years.\u201d The closings are especially hard for students like 11-year-old Riley White, who has Down syndrome and struggles with change. Her school, Desert Springs Preparatory, is just around the block from her tidy cul-de-sac. Some staffers at the school have worked with Riley since she was a kindergartener, and she has a tight circle of friends who she calls her sisters, said her mother, Felicia White. As Riley ran around her sun-baked backyard, White said she was considering leaving Arizona and moving her daughter somewhere with stronger backing for public schooling. With \u201cthe lack of support that gets put into our education system,\u201d other Arizona schools will also be forced to close in the coming years, White predicted. \u201cSometimes I sit and I think, why am I still trying to school her in this state \u2013 when I could go school her in a state that puts a lot more emphasis on her education?\u201d This story has been updated to include additional comment from the American Federation for Children on the group\u2019s political spending, sent to CNN post-publication.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/arizona-private-school-vouchers-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_us-alarm-china-north-korea-russia", "text": "The question wasn\u2019t even directed toward President Joe Biden, but his determination to get in an answer created a revealing moment about the war in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine and deepening US tensions with China. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked at a press conference in Italy last week about whether China was selling Russia arms for use in the war. Biden, who was standing beside him, waited for Zelensky to say President Xi Jinping told him he would not do so, before delivering a parting shot and ending the event. \u201cBy the way, China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it.\u00a0So, it is, in fact, helping Russia.\u201d The comment appeared to signal a hardening tone toward Beijing following months of US warnings that it shouldn\u2019t help its friends in Moscow over the war. NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg reinforced the tough new line during a visit to Washington Monday that included Oval Office talks with Biden. \u201cPublicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he\u2019s taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China\u2019s fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\u201d Stoltenberg said at The Wilson Center. \u201cAt the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\u201d Concerns that America\u2019s enemies are aiding Russia\u2019s war effort are sure to grow with the impending trip by Putin to North Korea, which the Kremlin said would have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d list of events, including with the isolated Stalinist state\u2019s tyrannical leader Kim Jong Un. The idea of an anti-US front among Russia, China, North Korea and Iran has long preoccupied foreign policy experts in Washington. Up until recently, US intelligence agencies have assessed that differences between the uneasy partners make formal alliances unlikely. But all those powers have one big thing in common: a desire to thwart American goals and power. Each is also subject to a brutal autocratic regime that is threatened by the democracy that unites the US and its European and Asian allies. The announcement that Putin is headed to Pyongyang raised the state of alert in Washington and caused expressions of concern from across the government. In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress that Russia\u2019s need to replenish its military supplies had forced it to grant \u201clong-sought concessions\u201d to North Korea. She did not specify the extent of the cooperation, but her comment sparked speculation that Moscow was offering nuclear or missile expertise. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell added to the intrigue last week when he said at a Stimson Center event that the North Koreans have embarked on a series of \u201cprovocative\u201d actions including by supplying Russia with artillery and missiles. And he added: \u201cWe have a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia and they have had a substantial impact on the battlefield.\u201d But the US doesn\u2019t seem to know what Kim will get in return. \u201cWhat is Russia going to provide in exchange to North Korea,\u00a0hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know but we are concerned by that and are watching carefully.\u201d He added: \u201cThe entire scope of the Russia/North Korea relationship is something we follow carefully and are concerned about.\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Monday that North Korea had unlawfully transferred dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to aid Russia\u2019s war effort. \u201cWe have seen those munitions show up on the battlefield in Ukraine. So, we know that they are using DPRK ammunition to threaten Ukraine and kill Ukrainians,\u201d he said. And White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said that while the US wasn\u2019t concerned about Putin\u2019s trip, it was looking to see whether it worsened security conditions in Ukraine and in Northeast Asia. \u201cWhat we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries not just because of the impacts it\u2019s going to have on the Ukrainian people, because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets, but because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Kirby added: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to be watching that very, very closely.\u201d Putin and Kim clearly know Washington is watching. In an article in North Korea\u2019s official\u00a0Rodong Sinmun newspaper,\u00a0the Russian leader wrote: \u201cWe highly appreciate the DPRK\u2019s unwavering support for Russia\u2019s special military operation in Ukraine.\u201d And he called the isolated state Russia\u2019s \u201ccommitted and like-minded supporter, ready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-jobs-biden-immigration", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, who has promised to conduct mass deportations if he is elected to a second term in November, continued his angry rhetoric about illegal immigration at a campaign rally in Nevada in early June. \u201cVirtually 100% of the new jobs under Biden have also gone to illegal aliens,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim\u00a0that nearly all the new jobs under Biden have gone to immigrants, whether or not they are allowed to legally work in the US\u00a0is false. The number of US-born workers increased about 3.5% between May 2021, just after Biden took office, and last month, though it did decline 0.2% over the past year,\u00a0according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u00a0 It\u2019s true that the number of foreign-born workers has increased at a much faster rate \u2013 20% \u2013 than the rate for native-born workers during Biden\u2019s presidency, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the native-born are not getting jobs. Also, many economists credit the influx of immigrant workers as a main reason the US labor market has remained strong, and the unemployment rates for both\u00a0immigrants and US-born workers remain low by historical standards. First, two caveats: We don\u2019t know how Trump is defining illegal aliens, specifically whether he\u2019s including people who may have entered the country illegally but now have work permits. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on foreign-born workers, which it defines as people who were born outside the US and neither of whose parents was a US citizen. The category covers legally-admitted immigrants including those who have become naturalized citizens, undocumented immigrants, refugees and temporary residents such as students and temporary workers, but the data doesn\u2019t specify the groups into which people fall. Getting back to the claim: One of the major themes of Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns has been that undocumented immigrants are destroying America. Here\u2019s what the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show: Some 130.4 million native-born people were employed in May. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 4.5 million since May 2021, shortly after Biden took office, though it\u2019s down nearly 300,000 from May 2023. (The data is not seasonally adjusted, so we must look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, about 123 million native-born people were employed.) Roughly 30.9 million foreign-born people held jobs in May, up 5.1 million from May 2021 and 637,000 since May 2023. (In January 2021, 25.3 million of the foreign-born were employed.) There is no comprehensive data on how many immigrants without work permits are employed, but economists at Standard Chartered Bank in May looked into what share of the recent job growth went to immigrants such as asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees and refugees who received authorization to work legally in the US. While none of these groups are working illegally in the US, as Trump referenced in his speech, the analysis provides useful insight into how many jobs these immigrants may have landed in recent years. Standard Chartered estimated that about half the jobs added in fiscal year 2024, which began October 1, went to these immigrants. On average, more than 170,000 of these immigrants a month received initial employment authorization documents from US Citizenship and Immigration Services in the current fiscal year, according to Standard Chartered\u2019s analysis. On average, about 64% of the foreign-born population are working, so that would translate into about 109,000 asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees and refugees finding jobs each month. The economy has added about 230,000 jobs a month this fiscal year, so these immigrant workers would account for just under half of that growth, according to the analysis, which was conducted by Steve Englander, head of North American Macro Strategy, and Dan Pan, economist, at Standard Chartered Bank. In fiscal year 2023, these immigrants likely held more than 800,000 of the 3.1 million jobs added, or more than 25%, the analysis estimated. Recent surges of immigration account for the increase in the share of immigrant workers\u00a0in the current fiscal year, the analysts said. The analysts note that they could be underestimating the number of such immigrants that landed jobs because they are often \u201cheavily motivated\u201d to work since they have limited access to public benefits. Trump could have fairly said, as some right-leaning commentators have suggested, that the number of native-born workers has declined in the past year, while the number of foreign-born workers has increased. But that\u2019s not true when looking over Biden\u2019s entire term in office. Moreover, some economists say it\u2019s better to look at the share of people working, rather than the number, because the former takes into account population and demographic changes, such as Baby Boomers aging out of the labor force. Some 59.3% of the native born were working last month, compared to 57.7% in May 2021, and some 64% of the foreign born had jobs last month, compared to 60.2% in May 2021. The economy was still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic shock early in Biden\u2019s term. Both groups had even lower rates of employment in January 2021. Still, the share of employed foreign-born men has been higher than the share of working native-born men since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 2007. Overall, the share of men who are working has been declining for decades \u2013 a trend that has puzzled labor economists and led to many theories as to the causes, such as the decline in factory jobs, increases in technology and globalization and the rise in the number of men with criminal convictions. All these can make it more difficult for men, particularly those with fewer skills or less education, to find work. \u201cForeign-born men come to this country, and they want to work,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen declining labor force participation rates among native-born men for decades.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-jobs-biden-immigration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_supreme-court-what-to-watch-trump-immunity-abortion-guns", "text": "The Supreme Court is turning toward the final, frenzied weeks of its term, readying potential blockbuster decisions on abortion, guns and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity. The decisions will land rapidly at a tense time for the 6-3 conservative-liberal court \u2013 just before a historic presidential election that has been heavily influenced by its decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade. Public opinion of the court remains at record lows. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, is facing sharp blowback over two controversial flags raised at his homes in Virginia and New Jersey. Here are some of the remaining cases to be decided before July. Trump claims \u2018absolute\u2019 immunity Trump\u2019s appeal for immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges landed at the Supreme Court late in the term and instantly overshadowed most of the docket. Trump argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April, though it didn\u2019t appear Trump would be able to get Smith\u2019s case tossed entirely. The immunity case, appears likely to come down to whether Trump\u2019s post-election actions were \u201cofficial\u201d \u2013 that is, steps he was taking as president \u2013 or whether they were \u201cprivate,\u201d which would not likely receive immunity. An appeals court in Washington sided against Trump. Abortion for health in emergencies The Supreme Court will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion. An Idaho law bars doctors from performing abortions unless the mother\u2019s life is at risk, but it makes no exception if that she would suffer long-term health consequences. The Biden administration argues a federal law requires hospitals to perform abortions if the health of a mother is at stake, and an appeals court agreed. The decision in Moyle v. US will place abortion access on the forefront again this summer just as Americans begin tuning into the presidential election. January 6 rioters seek to shorten sentences A former Pennsylvania police officer who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, challenged federal obstruction charges filed against him in a case that could also affect Trump. The former president was charged with violating the same obstruction law for different reasons. The case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump\u2019s rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer\u2019s attorney told the justices that prosecutors went too far by charging his client with \u201cobstructing\u201d an official proceeding, a crime he said Congress intended to be used to prohibit the destruction of evidence. Some 350 rioters were charged with the crime, which can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence. Some of those charges have since been dropped as part of plea agreements. Prosecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words \u201cobstruct\u201d and \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d covers the attack that interrupted Congress\u2019 counting of ballots to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win. Critics say the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation. Guns for domestic abusers In a significant Second Amendment case, the justices must weigh the constitutionality of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was indicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend\u2019s credit card was declined.  Rahimi\u2019s lawyers say a Supreme Court decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen meant the domestic violence law cannot be squared with the Constitution because it has no historical analogue. A 6-3 majority in Bruen said gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d An appeals court in Louisiana sided with Rahimi. Government regulation of Facebook The Supreme Court is confronting a series of cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. Perhaps the most notable are two suits challenging laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views. The state laws ban online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives. Two trade associations representing the social media companies sued, claiming they violated the First Amendment. One federal appeals court in Atlanta sided with the companies and against Florida. Another, in New Orleans, allowed the Texas law to take effect. The Supreme Court paused implementation of the Texas law in 2022. The cases are Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton. Cleaning up online \u2018disinformation\u2019 The justices must decide if the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, or whether those efforts violate the First Amendment. Biden officials have for years tried to persuade social media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things. Republican officials in two states \u2013 Missouri and Louisiana \u2013 and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing the administration did far more than \u201cpersuade\u201d the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. The case is Murthy v. Missouri.  Government regulations threatened A series of cases this term challenge the power of federal agencies to approve regulations \u2013 or enforce them. Among the most significant are two appeals filed by Atlantic herring fishermen. The captains are challenging a Department of Commerce regulation that requires them to pay the salary of federal observers they bring on board to monitor the catch and ensure the crew follows other fishing regulations. The court is being asked to overturn a 1984 precedent \u2013 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2013 that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing Washington has too much control over industry. The justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gives the court an opportunity to take a much broader stroke. Critics fear a ruling for the fishermen would threaten a vast swath of other federal regulations aimed at protecting the environment, public health and workplace safety. The cases are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce. Lower courts sided with the government in both cases. Access to abortion pill maintained In another major abortion case, the Supreme Court upheld US Food and Drug Administration efforts to expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone. The ruling was a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. By ruling that the anti-abortion doctors don\u2019t have standing to sue, the court left expanded access to the drug in place. Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. Medication abortions account for\u00a0nearly two-thirds of\u00a0all abortions in the US, according to some estimates. The appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who said their practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups have stressed that mifepristone is safe. The lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it sued. The location allowed the group to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to conservative US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Now, the case is expected to return to Kacsmaryk\u2019s court. Though the decision was a win for abortion rights groups, it was not a total victory: Other groups are likely to sue over the same provisions. Three conservative states that intervened in the original lawsuit may attempt to revive it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/supreme-court-what-to-watch-trump-immunity-abortion-guns/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The ex-president\u2019s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe\u2019s security. And the \u201cautocrats of the world\u201d name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House. Biden\u2019s emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy. But uncertainty over the West\u2019s long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It\u2019s fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky. In the United States, Trump \u2013 who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe\u2019s security given his endless attacks on NATO \u2013 may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend \u2013 especially in powerhouses France and Germany \u2013 could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin\u2019s willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does. But a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine\u2019s Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America\u2019s fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November. A flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine Still, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent. \u2014Biden\u2019s return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House\u2019s priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries. \u2014As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin\u2019s war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. \u201cRussia today has become a war economy,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. \u201cEvery day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.\u201d \u2014Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine\u2019s armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we\u2019ll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power. \u2014US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit \u2013 which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada \u2013 will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets. \u2014These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky\u2019s elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance. Russian advances on the battlefield These are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured. The latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites \u201ca worrisome trend\u201d of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Relentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv\u2019s electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon. Russian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe\u2019s territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war. \u201cThe Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,\u201d Clark said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Technically, they\u2019re pretty smart. They\u2019ve got China behind them; they\u2019ve got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later. An inspiring war turns into a bitter slog An extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes. At times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky\u2019s interactions with the West. The Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package \u2013 a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up. Biden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan. Not surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden\u2019s core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president\u2019s critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to \u201ctake bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom.\u201d But there\u2019s a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_roger-wicker-opposes-military-draft-changes", "text": "The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee strongly opposes making changes to the Selective Service System that would allow men to be automatically registered for the draft when they turn 18, casting doubt the proposal could become law even though the Democratic chairman of the panel said the idea has merit and it was approved overwhelmingly by the GOP-led House Armed Services Committee. \u201cIt just seems to me right now we don\u2019t need to cloud the NDAA with something that\u2019s not likely to happen in the next several years. We are not going to need a draft anytime soon,\u201d Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi told CNN, while arguing Washington shouldn\u2019t be distracted right now from its most important responsibility, which is standing up to urgent threats from international foes. At issue is a proposal championed by Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania and veteran of the Air Force, who pushed to add to the House\u2019s version of the National Defense Authorization Act language requiring men to be automatically registered for the draft based on existing federal records instead of registering themselves when they turn 18.\u00a0Doing so could increase compliance and save money that is now used for outreach efforts to encourage men to register voluntarily. The House NDAA passed out of committee on a broad 57-1 vote. It passed the full House on a more party line 217-199 vote. Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat of Rhode Island, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was only \u201cvaguely aware\u201d of the House proposal but said it might be worth doing. \u201cI think that is something we have to look at,\u201d he said. \u201cPresumably, if there is some data to show that it\u2019s more efficient way to do it I don\u2019t see a problem with it.\u201d Reed added: \u201cI think that\u2019s in the area that is subject to reasonable debate, which is, is it more efficient? Is it more effective? Will it help us mobilize quickly?\u00a0 Will it keep our records up to date better?\u201d Wicker has recently proposed a massive increase in defense spending starting next year in order to ensure the military is on its best footing.\u00a0He said now is one of the most dangerous times in US history, with conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and as threats loom from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. \u201cWe ought to concentrate on the crisis.\u00a0 And that is that we are not ready to deter this axis of aggressors from making a foolish mistake with regards to our resolve,\u201d Wicker said.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to concentrate on spending the necessary funds to get us to where we need to be.\u00a0 And there is no need to be talking about a draft right now.\u201d An accompanying issue is whether to require women to register for the draft.\u00a0 The version of the NDAA that passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee last week amends the Military Selective Service Act requiring women to register for Selective Service. Despite being in the Senate bill, Reed suggested that because of GOP opposition to drafting women, it might not survive when a final version of the bill is negotiated between the GOP-controlled House and Democratic-led Senate. \u201cThat has been a real sore point, that I can\u2019t understand. We have had amendments that would have required women to register and we can\u2019t get any real traction on the other side.\u00a0We are going to try to do it.\u00a0It makes sense. The military now is\u00a0a mixed force,\u201d he said. Wicker gave a one word answer \u2013 \u201cno\u201d \u2013 when asked about adding having women register. But he has spoken out about it in the past. \u201cI applaud the women who volunteer to serve in the military and who sacrifice every day for our country\u2019s freedom, but to compel their service by law is wrong,\u201d Wicker said in 2021 when a similar debate took place. \u201cI along with millions of other Americans cannot support the idea that our daughters and granddaughters would be forced to fight in our next military conflict against their will.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/roger-wicker-opposes-military-draft-changes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_student-loan-relief-federal-budget-deficit", "text": "The federal budget deficit will hit $1.9 trillion this fiscal year, according to an updated projection released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. That\u2019s 27% \u2013 or $400 billion \u2013 larger than the agency estimated in February. Looking longer term, the nation\u2019s debt will approach $57 trillion in fiscal year 2034, nearly $2.5 trillion higher than previously projected, as spending on Social Security, Medicare and interest payments soar and revenues fail to keep pace. The growing imbalance is expected to loom large over upcoming congressional budget and tax battles. Most of the spike in the fiscal 2024 deficit stems from four factors that are expected to boost projected spending. The largest is a $145 billion increase due to changes the Biden administration made to student loan repayment plans and a new, proposed forgiveness program that would waive some accrued interest for millions of borrowers. The latter has yet to be finalized but could take effect as soon as this fall. Also, the CBO increased the projected outlays for deposit insurance by about $70 billion because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is not recovering disbursements it made when resolving five bank failures from the last fiscal year and this fiscal year as quickly as anticipated. Three of the five bank failures in 2023 were among the\u00a0largest bank failures in US history. To replenish the multibillion-dollar hit\u00a0to the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund due to recent bank failures, the agency is temporarily levying higher fees on hundreds of insured banks and selling off failed banks\u2019 assets. Newly enacted legislation is increasing projected discretionary spending by $60 billion, and estimated spending on Medicaid is about $50 billion higher because actual outlays so far in fiscal year 2024 have been larger than expected. The fiscal year began on October 1. The cumulative deficit over the 2025 to 2034 period is now projected to be 10% \u2013 or $2.1 trillion \u2013 larger, the CBO said. The nation\u2019s ballooning budget deficits remain in the spotlight in this year\u2019s presidential election, as presumptive nominees President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both promise to improve the nation\u2019s fiscal status \u2013 but in very different ways. Also, the imbalance between federal spending and tax revenue will factor heavily into Congress\u2019 coming discussions on the fiscal year 2025 budget, the return of the debt ceiling in January, and the expiration of many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of next year. More than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025. Add in some corporate tax changes and interest, and the impact on the deficit swells to $4.6 trillion, according to a separate CBO analysis. Though continuing the tax cuts will increase the deficit, Congress is not expected to allow all of them to expire. Trump and Republican lawmakers have said they want to extend them all, while Biden and Democratic lawmakers are calling for raising taxes on corporations and those earning more than $400,000 a year. After adjusting to exclude timing shifts of certain payments, the CBO projects the deficit will be $2 trillion in fiscal year 2024 and grow to $2.8 trillion by fiscal year 2034. In relation to economic output, federal debt held by the public will rise from 99% this fiscal year to 122% in fiscal year 2034, surpassing its historical peak, the agency said. \u201cCBO\u2019s new report shows that the outlook for America\u2019s critical national debt challenge is worsening,\u201d Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an important time for a national conversation on these critical fiscal and economic challenges that we must address next year, and beyond.\u201d Immigration helps lower the deficit One bright spot in the CBO report is that the recent surge in immigration is expected to lower deficits by a net total of $0.9 trillion over the 2024 to 2034 period. The agency looked at an immigration category that includes people who entered the US illegally and have not obtained permanent legal status, people who entered lawfully through the use of parole authority and who may be awaiting proceedings in an immigration court and people who had temporary legal status but remained in the country after it expired. The CBO estimates that net immigration of people in this category will total 2.4 million in 2024 and decline in subsequent years. Between 2021 and 2026, the agency projects the number of these immigrants will be 8.7 million greater than it would have been had net immigration remained at its expected level. However, it warns that these projections are subject to \u201cmuch uncertainty.\u201d The surge is expected to boost revenues by about $1.2 trillion over the coming decade, mostly because the immigrants will pay income and payroll taxes on their earnings, the agency projects. It estimates that about half the immigrants in the surge will be authorized for work and notes that people without work permits will pay some taxes, though they are less likely to do so. Plus, the increase in immigration will lead to more economic activity, which will broadly boost income and tax revenues, the agency forecasts. Uninsured rate expected to rise The nation\u2019s uninsured rate hit an all-time low of 7.2% last year, but that figure is expected to rise to 8.9% in 2034, under a separate CBO analysis released Tuesday. The increase is mainly due to the end of a Covid-19 pandemic provision that barred states from disenrolling Medicaid enrollees until 2023, the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies at the end of 2025 and the surge in the number of immigrants, who are much more likely to be uninsured. The largest increase in the uninsured will be among adults ages 19 to 44, the agency estimates. Medicare enrollment is expected to swell from 61 million this year to 74 million in 2034, as the population ages. The number of people with Medicaid coverage is projected to drop from 92 million last year to about 79 million in coming years as a result of the end of the pandemic-era protection. Affordable Care Act enrollment is forecast to hit an all-time high of 23 million people next year and then fall to 16 million in 2034. Permanently extending the subsidies beyond 2025 would increase individual market coverage (both on and off the Obamacare exchanges) by 7.1 million, according to a third CBO report. The CBO\u2019s health insurance coverage projections will not be welcome news for the Biden campaign. The president has repeatedly touted the expansion of health insurance coverage during his administration. Congressional Democrats are hoping to extend the enhanced subsidies as part of negotiations over extending the 2017 tax cuts. This story has been updated with additional information.

It\u2019s one of the biggest busts yet as federal agencies\u00a0step up\u00a0efforts to target the highest levels of Chinese money laundering rings that experts\u00a0and officials tell CNN\u00a0are the go-to partners for Mexico\u2019s most dangerous drug cartels that traffic fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine into the US.\u00a0 Two \u201cfugitives\u201d named in the indictment unsealed in California have been arrested \u2014\u00a0one by the Chinese government and the other by the Mexican government, the\u00a0Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0said. It\u2019s a rare breakthrough for US law enforcement collaboration with China and Mexico, which have often bristled at US overtures to crack down on drug trafficking. The criminal network allegedly includes an array of Chinese, Mexican and American men who allegedly worked as couriers, money brokers and traffickers in an elaborate scheme to pick up big amounts of cash from the sale of cocaine and methamphetamine\u00a0in the Los Angeles area\u00a0and launder the money for the Sinaloa Cartel. Ten thousand fake fentanyl pills were also seized in the operation, according to the DEA. \u201cThese Chinese criminal money laundering networks can move money faster, cheaper and at a fraction of what is usually charged,\u201d DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said at a press conference hosted by the US Court for the Central District of California, which includes Los Angeles. Other recently unsealed federal indictments reveal an intense effort by DEA, IRS and other agencies to investigate and surveil alleged Chinese money launderers in more than a dozen states \u2014\u00a0the\u00a0product of years of investigative work. And interviews with current and former US officials offer glimpses into the tactics used to identify and infiltrate the financial networks supporting the\u00a0vastly lucrative drug trade into the US. A senior DEA official told CNN on Tuesday that the agency had in the last year seen an \u201cuptick\u201d in Chinese money laundering activity in the US. \u201cIn almost every investigation we have that involves the cartels and money laundering, the Chinese (groups) are involved,\u201d the DEA official said in an interview conducted on the condition that the official not be named. For the last decade or more,\u00a0Chinese money laundering groups\u00a0have undercut their competitors in Colombia and elsewhere by charging cheaper fees and tapping into the Chinese diaspora in the US and Latin America, experts say. These\u00a0money laundering rings have washed cash made from the sale of fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s a marriage made in heaven,\u201d Don Im, who spent three decades at the DEA tracking money laundering and other crimes, told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThe world\u2019s global drug markets have now become China\u2019s ad-hoc bank.\u201d Fentanyl has been the driving factor in a surge of deadly drug overdoses in the US in the last decade.\u00a0More than 74,000 people died after using synthetic opioids such as fentanyl in 2023, compared to about 5,500 in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug\u2019s catastrophic toll has sent the Biden administration searching for new tools to cut off fentanyl supplies and their financing. Federal agents continue to seize many tons of fentanyl\u00a0and other drugs\u00a0at the southern border each year. But in recent months there has been a more aggressive effort to put a dent in the cartels\u2019 coffers by seizing its cash. Despite the\u00a0growing use\u00a0of cryptocurrency\u00a0in the drug trade,\u00a0there\u2019s still plenty of cash to move around. One Chinese woman arrested in Oregon in April is accused of overseeing a network of couriers who made more than 100 cash deposits worth $17 million at banks from California to Virginia.\u00a0Another man allegedly part of another laundering network, who was arrested in South Carolina in March, was found with nearly $200,000 in cash in his car after driving from state to state to\u00a0pick up money,\u00a0according to prosecutors. Feds focus on Chinese launderers The DEA and departments of Homeland Security and Treasury have all announced new initiatives to track down and thwart\u00a0Chinese\u00a0money launderers\u00a0working for the cartels in the last year. The Treasury Department is stepping up its use of IRS agents and banking data from Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network bureau to identify Chinese money launderers operating in the US, a senior Treasury official told CNN. Homeland Security Investigations, a DHS agency, set up a\u00a0unit\u00a0in the Washington, DC, area to share intelligence with other law enforcement agencies and banks related to Chinese money laundering and other threats. The unit, known as the Cross-Border Financial Crimes Center, has been trying to thwart a particularly effective tactic used by the money launders: the use of fake, but very convincing, Chinese passports to set up bank accounts in the US, according to Senate testimony in April from senior HSI official Ricardo Mayoral. An HSI spokesperson did not respond to questions about the center\u2019s budget and staffing. The DEA created a new team to track \u201cillicit finance\u201d last year because \u201cwe started to see so much crossover between the cartels when it comes to laundering money,\u201d DEA Chief of Operations William Kimbell told the same Senate panel. The DEA has been able to \u201cidentify money laundering networks that we didn\u2019t know previously existed,\u201d Kimbell said. The senior DEA official told CNN the agency\u2019s new illicit finance team consists of about 25 people, some of whom are drawn from\u00a0preexisting\u00a0units that focus\u00a0exclusively on the cartels The recent intensified effort by federal agents to follow the money is clear to some observers. A US-based lawyer who has represented accused Chinese money launderers said the tempo of law enforcement operations against the alleged launderers has increased in recent weeks as federal agents close in on \u201cbigger fish\u201d among Chinese money launderers in the US. Federal agents have been interviewing accused Chinese money launderers and cross-checking names the witnesses offer in search of more senior people in the money laundering ring, said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. \u2018Money mules\u2019 Federal agents are up against powerful economic forces that bind together Mexican and Chinese criminal syndicates operating throughout North and Central America, according to experts. In China, citizens are allowed to send only $50,000\u00a0of currency outside of the country each year. That creates fierce demand for hard currency among Chinese nationals living abroad. Mexican cartels, on the other hand, are awash in cash but in need of people to move it around for them. and launder it through financial markets. The cartels, experts say, are using networks of \u201cmoney mules,\u201d or couriers who pick up\u00a0large amounts of\u00a0cash earned from drug sales to begin a multistep laundering process.\u00a0Those money mules \u201care opening accounts in banks big and small here in the US,\u201d the senior Treasury official told CNN. Treasury and IRS officials recently began privately briefing US banks and social media companies,\u00a0on whose platforms the drugs are often bought and sold, to try to get a clearer picture of how the cartels are exploiting the financial system, the Treasury official said.\u00a0\u00a0One focus of\u00a0the meetings, the official said, is how to use\u00a0intelligence\u00a0provided by smaller banks that can spot laundering fronts in their communities. But it is an open question among some US senators and outside experts whether there is effective coordination among the numerous federal agencies trying to track and seize drug money. \u201cWe have not put anywhere near the amount of attention that we should into the financial side \u2014 not just the return of the money, but also the illicit finance ecosystem that the money moves into when it exits legitimate US accounts,\u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat who co-chairs a Senate panel focused on US counternarcotics policy. \u201cI would love to say that there\u2019s a central money laundering command that draws together the effort of all of the engaged federal agencies and has excellent intel and law enforcement visibility into the scope of the money laundering and illicit finance problem. And we just don\u2019t,\u201d Whitehouse told CNN. Still, the nascent initiatives at DEA, DHS and Treasury to more aggressively target the cartels\u2019 money launderers are \u201cworking well enough to justify confidence that significantly enlarging them would be a very good strategy,\u201d he said. CNN asked multiple federal agencies\u00a0\u2014 the DEA, Department of Homeland Security, FBI and Treasury\u00a0Department\u00a0\u2014 for a rough estimate of how many Chinese nationals are laundering money for the cartels in the US. No one gave an answer. \u201cI wish I did. If you have a ballpark estimate, we would love to hear it,\u201d the senior Treasury official said.\u00a0The senior DEA official also did not provide an estimate. Whitehouse told CNN: \u201cI have no idea.\u00a0\u2026 Because of the weak and primitive nature of our enforcement structure, I would doubt that anybody has a very good idea.\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray told the US Senate this month that the FBI has more than 350 cases \u201clinked to the cartel leadership\u201d and 91 of those cases are \u201calong the southern border.\u201d CNN asked the FBI how many of these cases were related to Chinese money launderers working with the cartels. The FBI did not answer the question. Instead, the FBI provided a statement that says the bureau \u201cpursues investigations to disrupt all aspects\u201d of the threat from transnational drug cartels, \u201cfrom targeting their command-and-control structure to their key money laundering networks, as well as the local violent gangs that serve as retail distributors of their contraband.\u201d The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which oversees the federal response to the fentanyl epidemic, declined an interview request on the topic of Chinese money laundering, referring questions to the Treasury Department. CNN has also requested comment from the US Secret Service, which also plays a role in money laundering investigations. A lot of the federal work to counter the problem is shrouded in secrecy because it is at the intersection of two delicate subjects: ongoing drug-trafficking investigations and US-China relations. None of the federal law enforcement agencies involved in tracking Chinese money launderers agreed to be interviewed on the record. The Biden administration has implored the Chinese government to crack down on both the production of chemicals used to make fentanyl and money-laundering networks emanating from China. Some Biden officials say China is showing more of a willingness to address these problems after a President Joe Biden discussed them with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in November \u2014\u00a0and they point to China\u2019s arrest of one of the defendants charged on Tuesday as an example of that cooperation. Many Republicans disagree. \u201cNot only is China refusing to cooperate with American efforts to stem the deadly flow of fentanyl in our communities, it\u2019s actively fueling the crisis \u2013 all while the Biden administration sits back and watches,\u201d Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the other co-chair of the Senate drug panel, told CNN. Grassley and Whitehouse have each introduced legislation they say is key to closing loopholes in US law that are actively exploited by the cartels\u2019 money launderers. Elaborate networks Recent court documents illuminate how far-flung and elaborate US-based networks of alleged Chinese money launderers are. In an indictment returned by a grand jury in North Carolina in March, federal prosecutors accused a 37-year-old Chinese woman named Enhua Fang of running\u00a0an \u201cincredibly active cell\u201d for laundering money for the cartels (in this case, court documents did not identify the drug being trafficked).\u00a0Fang\u2019s couriers made more than 100 cash deposits worth $17 million at banks from California to Virginia, according to the indictment. In another case this Spring, DEA agents with drug-sniffing dogs detained a 46-year-old man named Li Pei Tan on the side of the highway in South Carolina and found nearly $200,000 in cash, two cell phones and a laptop in his car, according to an affidavit. It was\u00a0the culmination of a years-long undercover effort by federal agents to penetrate a money-laundering ring stretching from China to Belize that allegedly laundered hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money for the cartels, according to court documents. Tan, a Chinese-born man who lived in Georgia, is one of a pair of men accused of driving across the US to pick up the proceeds of fentanyl sales from affiliates of the cartels, taking a cut for themselves, and then using bank accounts in the US and abroad to launder the cash. Joe Habachy, a lawyer for Tan, declined to comment. Matthew Rothbeind, a lawyer listed in court records for Fang, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. DEA agents used wire taps and cell tower simulators to track Tan and Chaojie Chen from Chicago to Tulsa, and up and down the East Coast. They stopped Chen three times over five years as they built a case, pulling him over in Detroit, Chicago and Ohio. He was communicating with a \u201cmajor international money launderer and drug trafficker based out of mainland China,\u201d according to the affidavit, which did not name or charge that person. Greg Hunter, a lawyer for Chen, declined to comment. Mirror Transactions Experts say the Chinese money launderers have mastered the art of so-called mirror transactions, which involve a series of deposits at multiple bank accounts to conceal the drug money. For example, a money mule working for a Chinese money laundering ring will pick up cash that a cartel operative made from the sale of fentanyl in a given US state. The money launderers will then then transfer a comparable amount of money to a bank account in China held in the name of a front company. Once that is received, members of the money laundering ring based in Mexico will credit cartel-controlled bank accounts with a reciprocal amount of money in pesos. The method means money doesn\u2019t have to physically cross borders or the legitimate banking system. Mirror transactions allow \u201cChinese money launderers to sidestep international monetary rules,\u201d David Luckey, a fentanyl-focused homeland security expert at Rand Corporation, told CNN. \u201cIt creates the ability to move money without moving money.\u201d The tactics used by the Chinese money launderers make it \u201cvery difficult to follow the money and \u2026 to gather intelligence on all of the people involved,\u201d the senior DEA official told CNN. But some of the money laundering activity is allegedly going right through Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks. Fang, the woman indicted in the Western District of North Carolina, and her alleged co-conspirators deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars in accounts at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, according to court documents. Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and Bank of America declined to comment. JPMorgan Chase did not respond to requests for comment. US law enforcement agents will sometimes request that banks leave suspicious accounts open so that they can monitor them for an investigation, one source at a US bank told CNN. Despite Tuesday\u2019s bust, the money laundering rings that US officials say are the financial pulse of the cartels have every incentive to recover and rebound. \u201cWithout the money laundering services provided by the Organization and other similar money laundering organizations, many of the DTOs\u2019 [drug trafficking organizations\u2019] operations would grind to a halt,\u201d prosecutors said in a recent court filing arguing that Fang was a flight risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/us-chinese-money-launderers-drug-cartels/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history", "text": "Former President Donald Trump made\u00a0more than two dozen false claims\u00a0at his Tuesday campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin, including two significant attempts to rewrite Wisconsin history. The\u00a0first\u00a0was a slightly vaguer than usual version of his\u00a0familiar\u00a0lie that he won Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. He lost the state\u00a0by\u00a020,682\u00a0votes. The second was a version of a false claim Trump\u00a0delivered\u00a0in 2020 and again in 2022: his\u00a0assertion\u00a0that he had saved the Wisconsin city of Kenosha from destruction in 2020 when Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, refused to take action to deal with the civil unrest that followed the police shooting of a Black man. \u201cBy the way, you know, Kenosha: I saved Kenosha, do you know that? When I was president. Right? Right? I saved it,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cKenosha was \u2014 Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes and the governor wouldn\u2019t move, he just wouldn\u2019t move, and I moved. You know, I\u2019m not supposed to; it\u2019s supposed to be the governor, is supposed to do it, the mayor and the governor.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that Evers \u201cwouldn\u2019t move\u201d and that Trump was the person who \u201csaved Kenosha\u201d are false, as numerous fact-checkers\u00a0pointed out\u00a0when he made similar claims\u00a0in\u00a02020. Evers, not Trump, deployed the Wisconsin National Guard during the rioting in Kenosha \u2014 and Evers first deployed the\u00a0Guard the day before Trump publicly demanded that Evers do so. In other words, Trump insisted that Evers do something that he was already doing. Trump has repeatedly made a near-identical false claim about another state, Minnesota, that had a Democratic governor and civil unrest in 2020. Though Trump has asserted that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis over the objection of Gov. Tim Walz,\u00a0it was Walz who deployed the\u00a0Guard to Minneapolis hours before Trump demanded that he do so. The 2020\u00a0unrest in Kenosha, which involved both peaceful protests and acts of violence and vandalism, followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake by a White police officer who was\u00a0responding to a domestic disturbance call on August 23, 2020. (State and federal law enforcement later\u00a0decided\u00a0not to file charges against the officer.) On Tuesday, after Trump repeated his false claim, the governor\u2019s office provided CNN with the same\u00a0timeline it had sent to reporters when Trump had made the claim in 2020. The timeline, which is corroborated by public evidence, conclusively debunks Trump\u2019s narrative. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on the night of August 25, 2020, that the\u00a0\u201cgovernor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin.\u201d But the governor had already done so by then.\u00a0Evers authorized the deployment of 125 Wisconsin National Guard troops\u00a0just after 3 a.m.\u00a0the\u00a0day prior to the tweet, then\u00a0doubled\u00a0the deployment to 250 troops on the afternoon of the tweet \u2013 more than four hours before Trump weighed in. Evers continued to deploy more Wisconsin National Guard troops in the coming days, and he also\u00a0accepted\u00a0National Guard troops from three other states; they were never federalized. Evers did accept limited federal assistance from the\u00a0US Marshals Service\u00a0and the FBI, his office said, but that\u2019s no basis for Trump\u2019s claims that he saved the city when Evers wouldn\u2019t. The idea that the city\u2019s very existence was ever threatened is also\u00a0questionable, but we\u2019ll leave that aside here. Other Trump false claims Trump made lots of other false claims during the Racine rally. Here\u2019s a quick fact check on 12 of them: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cthe world was at peace\u201d when he was president in 2020, though there\u00a0were\u00a0numerous ongoing armed conflicts. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Democrats rigged the 2020 election, which did not happen. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0people\u2019s votes \u201ctend to disappear\u201d after they are cast, which is just not true. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0the country is \u201cin the middle of the worst crime wave in modern history,\u201d though preliminary statistics show crime\u00a0declined sharply in 2023 and the\u00a0first quarter of 2024. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he has been indicted more times than notorious gangster Al Capone, who was\u00a0indicted at least six times to Trump\u2019s four. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0somebody left cocaine at the White House \u201cabout a month ago,\u201d though that\u00a0happened about 11 months ago, and\u00a0said\u00a0it was \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine,\u201d though photos show the cocaine was in a\u00a0small bag\u00a0worth nothing even remotely close to that amount. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he went to Washington, DC, the other day for one of his trials, though the trip\u00a0was actually for meetings with congressional Republicans. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down his offer of 10,000 soldiers at the Capitol January 6, 2021; there is\u00a0no evidence she ever received such an offer, and she wouldn\u2019t have had the power to reject it if she did. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0no previous president had taken even 10 cents \u201cout of China\u201d from tariffs; the US\u00a0has had tariffs on China since the 1700s\u00a0and generated billions per year from them under predecessor President Barack Obama \u2014 and study after study has shown that Americans pay the tariffs, not China. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Syria and Turkey have been fighting over their border \u201cfor 2,000 years,\u201d though\u00a0historians have said this is nonsense:\u00a0Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire, and the modern border between them is less than 100 years old. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he thinks cumulative inflation under Biden is \u201c40 or 50 percent\u201d; it\u2019s\u00a0actually about 19%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_louisiana-classrooms-ten-commandments", "text": "Louisiana public schools are now required to display the Ten Commandments in all classrooms, after Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the requirement into law Wednesday. House Bill 71, approved by state lawmakers last month, mandates that a poster-size display of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be in every classroom at schools that receive state funding, from kindergarten through the university level. The legislation specifies the exact language that must be printed on the classroom displays and outlines that the text of the Ten Commandments must be the central focus of the poster or framed document. Before signing the bill, Landry called it \u201cone of (his) favorites.\u201d \u201cIf you want to respect the rule of law, you gotta start from the original law given which was Moses. \u2026 He got his commandments from God,\u201d Landry said. Opponents of the bill have argued that a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms would violate the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says that Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d Civil liberties groups swiftly vowed to challenge the law \u2013 which makes Louisiana the first in the nation to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom that receives state funding \u2013 in court. The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation\ufeff of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said that the law violates longstanding Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment and would result in \u201cunconstitutional religious coercion of students.\u201d \u201cThe First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government. Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,\u201d the groups said in a joint statement. Supporters of the law, in defending the measure, have leaned on the 2022\u00a0US Supreme Court decision in\u00a0Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The Supreme Court ruled that the coach\u2019s prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.\u00a0At the time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the establishment clause by permitting religious expression in public. Louisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the bill, said at the bill signing that \u201cit\u2019s like hope is in the air everywhere.\u201d Horton has dismissed concerns from Democratic opponents of the measure, saying the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \u201cmoral code\u201d in the classroom.

{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_us-pier-gaza-reattached-second-time", "text": "The US military\u2019s temporary pier has been reanchored to the Gaza coast,\u00a0two US officials\u00a0told CNN, several days after it was dismantled for a second time due to high seas and weather conditions. This is the second time the pier has had to be reattached to the beach:\u00a0the first time after it was damaged in heavy seas, and now after it was detached in anticipation of severe weather that could have damaged it again. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that conversation around a maritime corridor to bring aid into Gaza began near the end of October, following Hamas\u2019 invasion of Israel and the resulting offensive by Israeli forces in Gaza. The White House began exploring options\u00a0including\u00a0the feasibility of the temporary pier, which was deemed too risky at the time due to the weather conditions at that time of year and ongoing IDF operations. The idea was revisited in January and February as the need for humanitarian aid in Gaza became more dire. The pier was officially announced in March by President Joe Biden, who said in his State of the Union address that he was directing the military to build a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza. Within days, US Army watercraft had departed the US. The US\u00a0began constructing\u00a0the pier and causeway in April, and it began operating on May 17. Just a week later, however, operations were stalled due to weather; two days after that, high seas resulted in the pier\u00a0breaking apart. Four US Army vessels supporting the pier were beached as a result of the weather conditions, which officials said was unprecedented for that time of year. It took more than two weeks for one such vessel to be recovered on the Gaza beach. The pier was towed back to Ashdod for repairs, and more than a week later was\u00a0reattached to the beach\u00a0on June 7. One week later on June 14, the US said it would be\u00a0temporarily dismantling\u00a0the pier once again and moving it back to Israel in anticipation of heavy seas, to avoid it sustaining more damage. \u201cThe decision to temporarily relocate the pier is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\u201d a statement from US Central Command said. Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday that since the pier was originally anchored on May 17, it has delivered more than 3,500 metric tons of aid to Gaza; roughly 2,500\u00a0metric tons of aid were\u00a0delivered after it was reanchored on June 7. \u201cWe remain committed to working with the international community to get aid into Gaza as quickly as possible,\u201d Singh said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/us-pier-gaza-reattached-second-time/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_amy-coney-barrett-clarence-thomas-originalism", "text": "On a Supreme Court where the conservative supermajority increasingly leans on history as a guide, a dispute may be simmering over how many modern cases can be resolved by looking to the nation\u2019s past. Though Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 decision in a major trademark case last week was unanimous, it prompted a sharp debate led by Justice Amy Coney Barrett over the use of history to decide the case. Barrett, the newest conservative on the court, accused Thomas, the most senior associate justice, of a \u201claser-like focus on the history\u201d that \u201cmisses the forest for the trees.\u201d The back-and-forth could signal a recalibration by some members of the court of how and when\u00a0to apply originalism, the dominant legal doctrine among the court\u2019s conservatives that demands the Constitution be interpreted based on its original meaning. Even a slight change could have enormous consequences for the court\u2019s blockbuster cases, including a pending case that is likely to focus heavily on history to decide whether Americans who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders can be barred from owning guns. \u201cBarrett\u2019s critique of originalism definitely signals what seems to be a growing rift among the originalists on the court about the proper way to use history,\u201d said Tom Wolf, a constitutional law expert with the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cThere definitely is the potential formation here of an alternative or several alternative approaches to history that ultimately draw a majority,\u201d Wolf said. A lewd trademark gets historic treatment When the Supreme Court last week rejected a lawyer\u2019s bid to trademark the phrase \u201cTrump Too Small,\u201d all nine justices agreed on the outcome, but strong disagreements arose over the majority\u2019s decision to invoke the nation\u2019s \u201chistory and tradition\u201d to rebuff the trademark. Barrett, who endorsed the court\u2019s conclusion that a provision of federal trademark law barring the registration of an individual\u2019s name without that person\u2019s consent is constitutional, wrote separately to express her displeasure with the reasoning of Thomas\u2019 decision to rely on \u201chistory and tradition.\u201d That route, Barrett argued in a 15-page concurrence, \u201cis wrong twice over.\u201d The court\u2019s three liberals signed on to parts of Barrett\u2019s opinion. Though Barrett acknowledged in her opinion that \u201ctradition has a legitimate role to play in constitutional adjudication,\u201d the Trump nominee said that \u201cthe court\u2019s laser-like focus on the history of this single restriction misses the forest for the trees\u201d and sought to poke holes in the history and tradition-first route taken by Thomas and the other conservative justices who agreed with his legal rationale. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading proponent of originalism on the Supreme Court, once described his approach to interpreting the Constitution as a \u201cpiece of cake.\u201d But the debate playing out this term may be a recognition from some on the court that history is often messy and nuanced in a way that doesn\u2019t always yield easy answers. \u201cWhat we could be seeing is a more nuanced approach to using that history,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. \u201cIt\u2019s much more complicated than that \u2013 history is much more contested than that,\u201d Wydra said. \u201cAnd so to have this debate between two conservative justices, I think, brings a lot of light to the discussion.\u201d Several court watchers said it is far too early to read too much into the debate between Thomas and Barrett. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Barrett thinks tradition is sometimes relevant \u2013 and that she may have some difference with Thomas about when and exactly how much,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. \u201cBut there\u2019s not really a clear theory here.\u201d The \u2018limits\u2019 of history The court\u2019s approach to history will be closely scrutinized in its blockbuster Second Amendment decision expected in the coming days. In US v. Rahimi, the justices must decide the fate of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence retraining orders from owning guns. While a majority of the justices indicated during arguments in November that they will uphold the law, the real challenge for the conservatives will be how to square that decision with a two-year-old precedent that held gun prohibitions must have historical ties to survive under the Second Amendment. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, Thomas wrote that modern gun laws must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition.\u201d But there were no gun laws on the books at the nation\u2019s founding that dealt explicitly with domestic violence. And so to uphold the federal law, the court will have to likely have to at least explain how that standard applies to modern laws. When Thomas issued his majority decision in Bruen two years ago, Barrett joined Thomas\u2019 opinion in full. But she also penned a brief concurrence to highlight the \u201climits on the permissible use of history\u201d in deciding cases. Among them, she said, was identifying the historical date needed to assess whether a restriction was constitutional. In the months and years following the court\u2019s decision in Bruen, the \u201chistory and tradition\u201d framework has led judges across the US to strike down various gun restrictions while also perplexing some jurists who have noted the obstacles that accompany the new rule. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, too, noted those issues in a concurrence she issued last week in the trademark case. \u201cThe majority attempts to reassure litigants and the lower courts that a \u2018history-focused approac[h]\u2019 here is sensible and workable, by citing \u2026 Bruen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo say that such reassurance is not comforting would be an understatement. One need only read a handful of lower court decisions applying Bruen to appreciate the confusion this Court has caused.\u201d The court\u2019s other two liberals signed on to Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence. Barrett did not. History saves banking watchdog Last month, another split emerged in a case involving the funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal banking watchdog created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown. The payday lending industry sued the agency, claiming that the way Congress set up its funding violated the Constitution\u2019s appropriation clause. Writing for a 7-2 majority, Thomas dived deeply into pre-colonial English history and found that parliament \u2013 even as it tightened its grip on the government\u2019s purse \u2013 did not \u201cmicromanage every aspect of the king\u2019s finances.\u201d The legislature, in other words, gave the king some latitude and that discretion for the executive continued in the early days of the United States. Based on that history, the court upheld the modern agency\u2019s funding. But in a striking concurrence that captured support from both liberal and conservative justices, Justice Elena Kagan asserted that the court\u2019s historic analysis need not end with the late-18th century. Instead, Kagan wrote, the court could look at more modern times \u2013 a \u201ccontinuing tradition\u201d to decide the constitutionality of a government policy. Barrett and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both members of the court\u2019s conservative wing, joined that analysis, along with Sotomayor \u2013 suggesting that there may be different ways of thinking about history and tradition even among the conservatives who have ushered in that approach to deciding cases. \u201cI see this basically as an evolving dialogue amongst all the justices on the court and some of it is certainly being informed by the aftermath of some really ill-informed and deeply damaging opinions from earlier terms,\u201d said Wolf, pointing to Bruen and the court\u2019s decision two years ago overturning Roe v. Wade. \u201cCertain justices clearly understood the substantive problems with those rulings and also the methods problems with relying on history as dispositive in those cases at the time the court was doing it,\u201d he added. Thomas looks to English courts in trademark fight In the trademark dispute, Vidal v. Elster, Thomas\u2019 legal reasoning for upholding the section of the Lanham Act at issue broke new ground: It was, Sotomayor wrote, the first time the court had taken the history and tradition approach to decide a free speech controversy. Training his sights on the nation\u2019s \u201clong history\u201d of maintaining restrictions on trademarking names, Thomas invoked a series of cases dating as far back as the 19th Century and from courts outside the US. \u201cWe see no evidence that the common law afforded protection to a person seeking a trademark of another living person\u2019s name. To the contrary, English courts recognized that selling a product under another person\u2019s name could be actionable fraud,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis recognition carried over to our country.\u201d Thomas\u2019 rationale was joined by Kavanaugh, Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. But Barrett, Kagan, Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson parted ways with those five justices. Barrett\u2019s concurrence said the dispute could have been dealt with based on the court\u2019s past precedent with trademark law and stressed that just leaning on the nation\u2019s trademark history wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cIn my view, the historical record does not alone suffice to demonstrate the clause\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d she wrote. She went on to argue that even though the five-justice majority said it wasn\u2019t creating a new test in its opinion, \u201ca rule rendering tradition dispositive is itself a judge-made test.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/amy-coney-barrett-clarence-thomas-originalism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_immigration-policy-biden-what-matters", "text": "In two weeks, the White House has swerved from taking tough action against asylum-seekers trying to enter the country illegally to taking strong action to show empathy for people who have lived for years in the US immigration shadows. It was in early June that President Joe Biden pulled from former President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook to severely limit protections for asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally, effectively trying to seal the border to them, and addressing a changing mood in the country with regard to asylum-seekers. That move angered many progressives and immigration advocates and drew a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. But those groups will now cheer Biden\u2019s move Tuesday, offering new protection to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants \u2013 specifically some spouses of US citizens and their children \u2013 who are already in the US. The move could grant legal status to about 500,000 American families, according to the White House. Biden promises empathy; Trump promises mass deportation The new executive action offers a major contrast with Trump, who is promising to deport more than 10 million people from the US if he\u2019s elected to a second term. At the White House, Biden argued Trump\u2019s deportation policy would \u201crip spouses and children from their families, homes and communities and place them in detention camps.\u201d From CNN\u2019s report by Michael Williams: Under current federal law, an undocumented person who enters the United States and marries a US citizen must first request parole before applying for legal residency. That process requires them to leave the country if they were there illegally, upending their careers and families and creating uncertainty about whether they would be authorized to reenter.  Tuesday\u2019s action allows those spouses to apply for residency without needing to leave the United States \u2013 a key change that the Biden administration argues will keep families intact. Read Williams\u2019 full report. Undocumented immigrants eligible for the program will have to apply, but they can stay in the US as the process unfolds. The must have been married by June 17, before the new action was announced, and they must have been in the US for at least 10 years. Is this necessary? One Biden critic argued the new policy is unnecessary since few long-standing undocumented immigrants who are married to a US citizen would ever be deported. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the problem that the Biden administration is trying to solve here, and I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d Chad Wolf, an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said on CNN. He did not address Trump\u2019s deportation pledge during the interview. Seeking \u2018balance\u2019 Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who is the first former undocumented immigrant elected to Congress, told CNN\u2019s Brianna \ufeffKeilar that while he does not support the asylum action announced earlier this month, the addition of protection for undocumented spouses and their children \u201cbalances that out in a real smart way.\u201d He argued the immigration debate is too large for one single fix. \u201cJust to do (border) enforcement or just to do what we\u2019re doing today alone is not an answer to the vast majority of the American people that are concerned about this,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cThe immigration debate is very broad,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and these are very specific items within that broader debate that are being addressed.\u201d Legal limbo Biden\u2019s move could also lack permanence. An important caveat to any immigration action is that since Congress continually fails to address the immigration issue, anything a president does with executive power might be reversed by the next administration or invalidated by courts. Look no further than the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program enacted by the Obama administration in June 2012, another strong executive action positioned for effect in an election year. Still proud of that policy, Biden announced his new program in conjunction with the 12th anniversary of DACA. Obama enacted DACA; Trump tried to end it The DACA policy was enacted after bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform efforts failed for the umpteenth time. It was meant to bring people brought to the US illegally as children, frequently referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d out of the shadows and allow them to build lives in the country where they grew up. Nearly 600,000 people have sought protected status under the program, which defers but does not necessarily end any immigration action against them. The Trump administration tried to end the DACA program in 2017, but the effort eventually failed at the Supreme Court in 2020. Instead, Trump hit pause on new applications, something the Biden administration then reversed. Would today\u2019s Supreme Court protect DACA? After the Biden administration tried to formalize the DACA process, a federal judge in 2021 agreed with Texas and other states that the program must be ended, again halting new DACA applications. That case is now under appeal and could land the DACA issue back at the Supreme Court. When a divided 5-4 court prevented the Trump administration from ending DACA in 2020,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal justice, was still on the court. She has been replaced by a conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In 2020, Chief Justice John Roberts infuriated conservatives by joining the liberal block of justices to rule against Trump on technical grounds. The new case and the new makeup of the court mean DACA is far from safe. Congress could, of course, fix all of this with action, but it has failed to pass comprehensive reform despite attempts that go back decades. The much more modest bipartisan effort pushed by Biden earlier this year would not have helped the undocumented spouses of citizens and their children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/immigration-policy-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_election-age-what-matters", "text": "A truism of American politics is that older voters prefer the Republican and younger voters prefer the Democrat. That\u2019s what happened in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won voters under 50 and Republican Donald Trump won voters over 50, according to exit polls. Biden\u2019s margin among younger voters \u2014 he got 65% of voters ages 18-24 \u2014 helped him overcome the fact that Trump got 52% of older voters, who accounted for more than half the electorate. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College even though she got more votes than him, but the pattern of younger voters supporting the Democrat held. Clinton got more votes among voters ages 18-44, and Trump got more votes among voters ages 45 and older, according to exit polls. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney lost the election, but he did better than Democrat Barack Obama among voters 45 and older. Voters under 30 haven\u2019t preferred the Republican since 1988, when George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in a landslide. Voters over the age of 65 haven\u2019t preferred the Democrat since 2000, when Al Gore lost the election despite getting more votes than Republican George W. Bush. But the old rules don\u2019t seem to apply in this year\u2019s presidential election, where both candidates are old men and their fitness to serve is a top issue. Older voters are gravitating to Biden, and younger voters are taking a look at Trump. A new Marist poll in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, for instance, showed a tight race overall with Trump at 47% and Biden at 45%, a within-the-margin-of-error difference. Trump is making inroads with voters of color and is nearly even with Biden among voters under 45 in that poll. But older voters have gone in the opposite direction, and instead of favoring Trump, are nearly split in the Marist poll. It\u2019s a trend that extends to other states. In a nationwide Quinnipiac University poll released in May, Biden and Trump split younger voters, but Biden has an edge among voters 65 and older. Not\u00a0every poll shows the same\u00a0level of shift,\u00a0but\u00a0the general movement among both younger and older voters is\u00a0a departure from past results. Biden is now leaning into questions about his age that have dogged his reelection campaign and worry voters in opinion polls. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d first lady Jill Biden said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin this week, part of a three-day swing designed to boost his support among older voters. Older voters are essentially Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s peers. Both men were born in the 1940s. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Eric Bradner note that older voters were \u201calive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy.\u201d They also write that \u201cin 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country.\u201d In Michigan, Zeleny and Bradner talked to Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who only got active in politics after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen,\u201d she said. Despite the shift of older voters in the direction of Biden (and younger voters away from him), I was surprised to see older voters still have reservations about Biden\u2019s age. In a February New York Times/Siena College poll, nearly three-quarters of registered voters ages 65 and older said Biden was too old to be effective as president compared with less than half who said the same about Trump. Those figures tracked with the population at large. CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein noted last year that older voters were more likely to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance and argued that some of his policy wins, like pushing for lowering drug costs in Medicare, appeal directly to seniors. Whatever the reason, if Biden is to overcome questions about his age to keep his job, it will be with help from people his own age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/election-age-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that.

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial", "text": "A top federal prosecutor handed Sen. Bob Menendez a lifeline at the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s corruption trial Tuesday, telling the court during cross examination that Menendez never asked or pressured him to act improperly on behalf of a political ally. Philip Sellinger, now the US attorney for the District of New Jersey,\u00a0said that\u00a0in late 2020,\u00a0he\u00a0went to Menendez hoping for the senator\u2019s support in his bid to be nominated to the post. During the conversation, Sellinger testified, Menendez mentioned that Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer and co-defendant in the case, \u201cwas being treated unfairly\u201d by prosecutors who had indicted him on bank fraud charges. \u201cSen. Menendez hoped that if I became US attorney, that I would look at (the Daibes case) carefully,\u201d Sellinger said. That testimony came up again Tuesday when Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman pressed Sellinger on the nature of that interaction. \u201cI did not believe that (Menendez) was asking me to do anything other than my official duty,\u201d Sellinger, a longtime friend and political supporter of Menendez, told the court.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t believe he was asking me to do anything.\u201d At that, Weitzman asked Sellinger if it was \u201cfair to say that he didn\u2019t ask you to put your thumb on the scales of justice?\u201d Sellinger nodded in agreement. Now in its sixth week, the trial has shifted its focus from allegations that Menendez, along with his wife, Nadine, accepted bribes\u00a0from a New Jersey businessman to charges that the senator was part of a corrupt deal involving Daibes and the government of Qatar. The trial resumed Tuesday following a three-day delay after Daibes tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The Menendezes, Daibes and Egyptian American businessman Wael Hana are accused of engineering a complex and multifaceted bribery scheme. All four have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. A fifth alleged co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified for the government as a cooperating witness. Sellinger was not initially recommended by Bob Menendez for the US attorney nomination, a decision prosecutors suggest was tied to his unwillingness to entertain the senator\u2019s concerns about the Daibes case. Sellinger testified last week that he told Menendez he would have to recuse himself from any issues relating to Daibes because of a past legal entanglement with the developer. Former Menendez adviser Michael Soliman described the behind-the-scenes push for an alternative to Sellinger in his testimony Tuesday. Ultimately,\u00a0Soliman said,\u00a0Menendez decided to recommend then-Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez to the White House. But that choice faced harsh and immediate blowback centered on Suarez\u2019s handling of a rape accusation a volunteer for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s 2017 campaign made against Murphy staffer Al Alvarez. Suarez did not bring charges against Alvarez, whom she had known for more than a decade. A subsequent probe by then-New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal found that Suarez had not acted inappropriately. (Grewal testified earlier in the trial that Menendez tried to meddle in a separate case,\u00a0although he too said under cross-examination that the senator did not ask him to put his thumb on the scales of justice.) Soliman described to the court in excruciating detail his work to fend off critical press reports about Suarez and manage the public perception of Menendez, who was coming under fire for backing her.\u00a0After a few ham-handed attempts by Suarez to defend herself to local media outlets and, eventually, the Biden administration\u2019s refusal to nominate her, Solimon\u00a0said he\u00a0and Menendez went searching for a \u201cPlan B.\u201d Around that point, in the spring or summer of 2021, Solimon said he had another conversation with Sellinger. This time, Sellinger told Solimon that he would not, after all, need to recuse himself from the Daibes case if he was nominated and confirmed. Sellinger, though, was having difficulty getting an audience with Menendez, so\u00a0he passed the message along to Solimon,\u00a0he testified. \u201cIf you call Sellinger,\u201d Solimon\u00a0said he\u00a0told Menendez after the meeting, \u201cyou\u2019ll be comfortable with what he says.\u201d With Suarez\u2019s chances sunk, Menendez recommended Sellinger for the job he had wanted all along. The White House nominated Sellinger, who was confirmed and took office in December 2021. But in an about-face, Sellinger did recuse himself from the Daibes case. Solimon told the court that Menendez asked him to find out why Sellinger changed his mind, describing the senator as \u201cinquisitive\u201d and \u201cconfused\u201d but not angry when told of the decision. Solimon told Menendez he would contact Sellinger, he testified, but never did. Sellinger and Solimon would, however, eventually get together for a meal. But before they could sit down, Solimon recalled, Sellinger warned him against bringing up any specific, ongoing criminal case, telling him he would have to report anything of the sort to the Justice Department. Solimon said he never raised the Daibes case. Menendez, after being told about the interaction, expressed some regret,\u00a0Solimon said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that,\u201d he told his close aide, then dropped it. Menendez, though, remained frosty toward Sellinger,\u00a0who testified that the senator rejected an invitation to his investiture ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m going to pass,\u201d Menendez said, according to Sellinger, adding:\u00a0\u201cThe only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney \u2013 and you don\u2019t.\u201d Prosecutors said in court Tuesday morning that they plan to rest their case on June 25.\u00a0Defense lawyers said they hope to rest their case in time for the jury to be charged by the week of July 8. There is no court Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday, and the trial will resume Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_us-israel-f-15-jets", "text": "Two key congressional Democrats have given their approval to allow the Biden administration to proceed with what is believed to be the biggest weapons package for Israel,\u00a0expected to be\u00a0worth more than $18 billion and include some 50 F-15 fighter jets. Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, had delayed signing off, telling\u00a0CNN in April\u00a0that he was still looking for \u201cassurances\u201d from the Biden administration over the types of weapons before giving his approval to the sale. In a statement Monday night, Meeks highlighted threats to Israel beyond Hamas in Gaza, saying he remains \u201csupportive of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against the real threats posed by Iran and Hezbollah\u201d and noted that the planes won\u2019t be delivered to Israel for years. \u201cI have been in close touch with the White House and (National Security Council) about this and other arms cases for Israel and have repeatedly urged the administration to continue pushing Israel to make significant and concrete improvements on all fronts when it comes to humanitarian efforts and limiting civilian casualties,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cI continue to support the administration\u2019s pause on certain munitions transfers due to concerns about ongoing civilian casualties in Gaza.\u201d Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave the green light after the sale went through the review process, a spokesman said. \u201cAny issues or concerns Chair Cardin had were addressed through our ongoing consultations with the Administration, and that\u2019s why he felt it appropriate to allow this case to move forward,\u201d committee communications director Eric Harris said. \u201cAs a matter of policy, we do not confirm or comment on proposed cases until they have been formally notified to Congress,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said. The sale comes as President Joe Biden is putting increasing pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza against Hamas and other militant groups following the October 7 attacks in Israel. Biden officials have argued that Hamas has been degraded to the point where it couldn\u2019t carry out another similar attack. Biden threatened to withhold weapons for Israel if it carried out a major offensive in central Rafah. While Israel has steadily increased its operations in Rafah, further displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, the administration has argued those activities didn\u2019t cross the line. More than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to Gaza\u2019s ministry of health. Democrats have increasingly called on the White House to do more to condition aid to Israel. \u201cI say it is enough of the indiscriminate bombing,\u201d Meeks told CNN in April. \u201cI don\u2019t want the kinds of weapons that Israel has to be utilized to have more death. I want to make sure that humanitarian aid gets in. I don\u2019t want people starving to death and I want Hamas to release the hostages.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/us-israel-f-15-jets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_social-security-medicare-election-what-matters", "text": "Unlike most Republicans who have been critical of former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Paul Ryan is not about to make an endorsement or even indicate he\u2019ll grudgingly vote for Trump. Arguing Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d for office, Ryan, a Republican who represented the battleground state of Wisconsin in Congress, said on Fox News this week that he\u2019ll write in some other Republican \u2013 a conservative rather than a populist like Trump. It was a notable moment, particularly since it occurred on Fox News, where opposition to Trump is hard to come by. Ryan, who has turned to a lucrative career on Wall Street since leaving politics, remains on the board of the conservative network\u2019s parent company. \u201cI would prefer a party that is based on principles, not personality or populism,\u201d Ryan said, describing himself as \u201can anti-establishment Republican at this time.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning turn for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, to be so out of whack with his party. Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who selected Ryan as his running mate, is also now effectively a member of the shrinking Republican resistance to Trump. A promise to do nothing Like many Americans, Ryan said he isn\u2019t happy with either of the major-party candidates, but he has a very specific reason for concern. It\u2019s worth taking a closer look at his important point. \u201cThey\u2019re both promising not to tackle the debt,\u201d Ryan said, coming back to the issue that has animated his political career. \u201cAll the First World countries have the same issue we have: baby boomers retiring and unfunded entitlements coming due, and massive amount of debt,\u201d he said, referring to Social Security and Medicare, on which millions of aging Americans rely for their quality of life but which also eat up a growing portion of federal spending. For the record, both President Joe Biden and Trump have sworn they will not cut benefits. When Trump suggested in an interview in March that he might be open to Medicare and Social Security cuts, his campaign quickly made clear that no, he was talking about waste, not touching the programs themselves. He attacked other Republicans during the primary for being open to reforming these programs. $34 trillion and counting The current US national debt exceeds $34 trillion, a figure that has exploded under both parties. Pandemic-era spending had bipartisan support. Republicans passed massive tax cuts under Trump. Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act under Biden and the Affordable Care Act under then-President Barack Obama. Ryan is absolutely correct that neither side, at least at the presidential level, is making action on the debt a political priority. \u201cYou can fix it if you have the political will,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the political will right now. We don\u2019t have serious politics right now.\u201d Whether and exactly how concerned to be with that debt is a matter of intense debate among policy wonks and economists, but the idea that the US is on an unsustainable path is generally accepted. More focus on tax cuts Meanwhile, in the larger political conversation, there\u2019s more focus on how or whether to extend Trump-era tax cuts that will expire next year. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby has a look at the opposing promises from Biden and Trump. Trump wants to extend all of the tax cuts, which could further explode the debt without corresponding spending cuts. Biden, on the other hand, wants to allow the cuts to expire only for those making $400,000 and up. He would also try raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. When Trump and Republicans enacted the current tax structure, they made individual tax cuts temporary and most of the corporate tax cuts permanent. Democrats are also hoping to use the tax debate as leverage to increase social safety net spending. More from Luhby: Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced\u00a0child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous\u00a0Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the\u00a0American Rescue Plan Act\u00a0that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. Her story \u2013 read it here \u2013 outlines more of the looming tax implications and spells out the argument that the Trump tax cuts were a huge success alongside the opposing argument that they were a total failure. What\u2019s not up for debate is that the debt has grown, by trillions of dollars, under both Trump and Biden. Fearing \u2018radical budget surgery\u2019 Ryan fears a future when the Treasury Department can no longer sell the interest-bearing bonds that fund deficit spending, at which point the government would essentially have to print money to cover expenses. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a dollar crisis. That\u2019s when the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency is called into question. That\u2019s a huge privilege we could lose,\u201d he said, arguing it would lead to \u201cradical budget surgery\u201d \u2013 steep, painful cuts \u2013 to get out of the crisis. Solve the problem now or solve the problem later, he is arguing, but solving it now will be less painful. Tough choices could come sooner than you think Social Security won\u2019t be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035 unless Congress acts, according to a government forecast. Spending on the program will balloon, and the trust funds that currently fund it will run dry. At that point, the payroll tax and other income sources that fund Social Security will only be able to pay 83% of benefits. Congress will be forced to do something. It\u2019s a similar story with a slightly different timeline for Medicare. \u201cIf you step ahead of this problem, you can solve the insolvency of these entitlement programs without affecting anyone\u2019s benefits who are on them today,\u201d Ryan said. The broad strokes of what needs to be done are generally known and have been suggested by a variety of commissions, foundations and economic policy groups. The fixes could include incrementally raising the retirement age over the coming years and changing the funding structure for the systems to raise more money. Biden has proposed additional taxes on those making more than $400,000 to address Medicare\u2019s solvency, among other ideas, but does not have a detailed Social Security plan. Ryan has previously endorsed reform Ryan, to his credit, proposed some of the more revolutionary changes earlier in his career. When House Republicans passed versions of those plans, he paid a political price. They arguably contributed to his and Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. \u201cThe problem is, doing what I just said, you lay yourself out there for ridicule,\u201d Ryan said on Fox. \u201cYou lay yourself out there for political shots.\u201d He added: \u201cInvariably, the political demagoguery makes it look like you\u2019re taking something away from people. The dirty little secret in all of this is, Medicare and Social Security are going insolvent on their own. That means they go bankrupt. That means current seniors do get their benefits cut if we do nothing.\u201d But Ryan also deserves some blame He was House speaker, for instance, when Republicans passed those Trump tax cuts in 2017, which cut government income without addressing spending. Ryan suggested a fix to the problem now could be a commission set up to create a path to solvency and which would be able to force a vote in Congress. There are previous examples of such commissions, such as the one helmed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1983. Ryan actually sat on another one during the Obama administration. Chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, it was called the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and it sought a bipartisan menu of tough choices to deal with the unsustainable path it has been clear the US has been on for a long time. When it came time to endorse those proposals, however, Ryan voted no, helping kill the commission.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/social-security-medicare-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_john-roberts-recording-what-matters", "text": "The funny thing about \u201csecret\u201d recordings made of public figures is that they generally confirm what everyone already knew. The propriety of liberal activist Lauren Windsor pretending to be a religious conservative in order to surreptitiously record Supreme Court justices attending a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society can certainly be debated. The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_virginia-primary", "text": "A rancorous Republican congressional primary in Virginia that has been a proxy fight amid larger party divisions remained unresolved Wednesday morning. House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, who angered allies of former President Donald Trump and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, was trailing state Sen. John McGuire by 342 votes as of Wednesday morning in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District \u2013\u00a0a margin small enough for a second-place finisher to call for a recount should it hold. Mail ballots can continue to arrive until Friday. CNN has not made a projection in the race as yet. Good wrote on social media Tuesday night that his team was still waiting on final election results. \u201cWe implemented the best early voting operation that the 5th District has ever seen, and we are still waiting for the results of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. We are doing what we can to ensure we have teams of observers and legal counsel to ensure all the votes are properly counted in the coming days,\u201d the congressman said. McGuire, who had Trump\u2019s and McCarthy\u2019s backing, however, was already looking forward to November. \u201cThere are still a few votes left to count, but it\u2019s clear that all paths end with a victory,\u201d the state senator wrote on social media early Wednesday morning. \u201cI look forward to working with Trump to beat Joe Biden in November & pass Trump\u2019s agenda in Congress.\u201d Good faced a fierce effort to knock him out from a broad swath of the GOP in what became the most expensive House Republican primary of the cycle. As one of the chief architects of the move to oust McCarthy last fall, Good drew the ire of the former speaker\u2019s allies, who spent millions seeking revenge. The congressman also lost Trump\u2019s support after he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. Key Trump impeachment figure will win Democratic primary for open Virginia seat Eugene Vindman, a retired Army colonel and key figure in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, will win the Democratic primary for Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, CNN projects. Vindman is looking to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in what is expected to be a competitive race this fall with the House GOP\u2019s narrow majority on the line. Derrick Anderson, a retired Army Green Beret, is projected to win the Republican nomination to take on Vindman in the 7th District, which includes the Washington, DC, exurbs. Vindman and his twin brother, retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, are best known for their role in the impeachment after both raised concerns about a 2019 phone call between\u00a0Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the call, Trump allegedly asked for an investigation into Hunter Biden, the son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. Alexander Vindman was a star witness during the 2020 impeachment hearing, and the twins \u2013 who both worked for the National Security Council \u2013\u00a0became heroes to Democratic activists opposed to the former president. Eugene Vindman\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s\u00a0impeachment likely made a difference in his campaign. While most of his primary opponents were current and former elected officials, the first-time candidate raised $5 million through May 29, federal records show. That haul was about four times as much as the combined total of the other six Democrats in the race. Spanberger, the retiring congresswoman, is vacating her seat to run for governor next year. A former CIA officer, she won a third term in 2022 by 5 points. Cole\u00a0coasts in Oklahoma primary Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the veteran Republican who chairs the House Appropriations Committee,\u00a0will easily fend off a primary challenge\u00a0in the state\u2019s 4th\u00a0Congressional District, CNN projects. Cole is projected to win a four-way primary that included insurance broker Paul Bondar, who loaned his campaign more than $5 million through May 29 and blanketed the airwaves with ads. Cole, a longtime GOP operative, had Trump\u2019s endorsement. But Bondar cast himself as a more conservative alternative to the veteran congressman. He also sought to undercut ties between Trump and Cole, airing ads highlighting Cole\u2019s donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 GOP primary rivals\u00a0before they ran for president. First elected to Congress in 2002, Cole has maintained close ties to conservatives in the House \u2013 and voted against certifying certain 2020 election results and against impeaching Trump twice. \u201cHe has almost always voted with me, including on both Impeachment Hoaxes,\u201d Trump said in his early May endorsement of Cole. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of Tuesday\u2019s race was how new Bondar\u2019s ties to Oklahoma are. After spending most of his career in Illinois, Bondar moved to Texas in 2020, living outside Dallas \u2013 where he voted in this March\u2019s Republican primary.\u00a0Then, in April, he launched his\u00a0congressional\u00a0campaign in Oklahoma. State voting records show Bondar\u2019s early in-person ballot in his\u00a0primary race is the first time he has voted in Oklahoma.\u00a0Cole\u2019s allies\u00a0aired ads questioning Bondar\u2019s residency. The pro-Cole Americans 4 Security super PAC aired a 30-second spot that compared the primary to the Red River rivalry \u2013 a famously bitter one featuring the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas.

{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_us-allies-nato-membership-debate", "text": "The United States and several key allies, including the United Kingdom, are actively debating how strongly to commit to Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0NATO membership\u00a0at the\u00a0alliance\u2019s\u00a0upcoming 75th anniversary summit\u00a0in Washington, with the US facing criticism from a variety of European countries for not being willing to go as far as several \u2013 especially those close to Russia\u2019s\u00a0border\u00a0\u2013 would like, according to multiple US and European sources familiar with the discussions. US and German officials have proposed that the alliance pledge during next month\u2019s\u00a0summit\u00a0that Ukraine has a \u201cbridge\u201d to NATO membership, rather than an \u201cirreversible path\u201d as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\u00a0said in April\u00a0in language that is favored by the UK and several Eastern and Central European nations,\u00a0multiple\u00a0sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. The eventual language issued by the alliance about Ukraine during July\u2019s summit in Washington is critical. It will be painstakingly debated by the allies in the days leading up and then heavily scrutinized,\u00a0as it will outline to\u00a0the world \u2013 Russia in particular \u2013 what the goals are for Ukraine within NATO. \u201cAt the (Washington) Summit, we\u2019ll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there\u2019s a bridge to membership, a bridge that\u2019s strong and well-lit,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a NATO Foreign Ministerial in Prague in late May. A senior US official said that Biden administration officials do not think the word \u201cirreversible\u201d would get the support of the entire alliance, pointing in particular to Hungary\u00a0as a likely holdout. The official said the US believes they are close to a resolution with all allies on the language but declined to preview the decision. Some NATO members are also reluctant to use the word\u00a0because Ukraine has yet to implement all of the necessary democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership, a separate US official said. With the summit about a month away, the topic remains a central point of tension in ongoing conversations. \u201cMost Central European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration\u2019s ambiguity and procrastination\u201d when it comes to outlining a concrete pathway forward for Ukraine, a Central European diplomat told CNN. A second European official whose country is more aggressive on Ukraine\u2019s membership than the US said that European allies have been directly lobbying the White House to make Ukraine\u2019s pathway as clear as possible. \u201cWe instinctively feel a new path should be laid out,\u201d the second official said. \u201cFast tracking [Ukraine\u2019s membership] should be looked at.\u201d In April, Stoltenberg told Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky in Kyiv that \u201cthe work we are undertaking now puts you on an irreversible path towards NATO membership, so that when the time is right, Ukraine can become a NATO member straightaway.\u201d Still, there is a general recognition that NATO\u2019s position out of the summit needs to have advanced from last year\u2019s meeting in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when the allies declared that \u201cUkraine\u2019s future is in NATO\u201d but didn\u2019t offer a timeline.\u00a0Members of the alliance announced at the time that they would remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine, making it easier for the country to join the alliance, but still\u00a0declined to offer\u00a0a timeline on how long that might take. That was met with fury by Zelensky who posted on X that it was \u201cunprecedented and absurd\u201d not to have been offered a timeline for membership. Vague commitment in 2008 It was back in 2008 at a NATO summit in Budapest that Ukraine was first offered a vague commitment of an invitation to join in the future. Ukrainians often invoke the lack of clarity dating back 16 years as an argument for deserving more, particularly when under attack by Russia. \u201cI\u2019m certain that we will also have language expressing that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance,\u201d Stoltenberg said Tuesday at a news conference at the US State Department. \u201cThe exact language, exactly what we will agree \u2026 are now discussed among allies. But I\u2019m confident we have a good solution, agreement by the summit.\u201d The Biden administration has trumpeted its newly signed ten-year defense pact with Ukraine, which calls itself \u201ca bridge to Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership in the NATO Alliance.\u201d But for many Europeans that doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cOf course we\u2019d be for \u2018irreversible,\u2019\u201d a third Eastern European official said. It\u2019s \u201cnot a big secret we are eager to get more\u201d than the US, the official added, adding they hope the US administration can remain \u201cflexible\u201d ahead of the formal meetings next month. Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin said last week that peace talks would only begin with Ukraine if Kyiv officially gives up on its NATO aspirations. \u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares that it is ready for such a decision,\u201d Putin said on Friday, \u201can order to cease fire and begin negotiations will immediately follow from our side, literally at the same minute.\u201d A key component of NATO membership is a mutual defense pact known as Article V that commits NATO allies to defend any member that is attacked. Ukraine has been intensifying its push to join NATO\u00a0since it was first attacked\u00a0by Russia in 2014. Since the war in Ukraine began in 2022, Ukrainian and European officials have accused the US of being too afraid of provoking Putin and escalating the conflict. Ukraine has both been grateful and frustrated as it watched the US offer bigger and bigger weapons packages, but at a slower pace than it has needed. Last month Stoltenberg\u00a0indirectly\u00a0criticized the Biden administration for not allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to fire into Russia, which Ukrainians have said amounts to them fighting with one hand tied behind their back. \u201cThis is a war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine,\u201d Stoltenberg told The Economist. \u201cUkraine has the right to defend themselves. And that includes striking targets on Russian territory.\u201d On May 30 the Biden administration announced that Ukraine could fire into Russia but only in a limited way: at military targets across the border from the city of Kharkiv and not with the most formidable US weapons, the long-range ATACMS missile. London has often been much more forward-leaning than Washington on weaponry for Ukraine and how it\u2019s used. Generally, throughout the conflict, British officials, the closest US allies in NATO, have consistently hoped the White House would take a more aggressive stance. Officials\u00a0who\u00a0CNN spoke with emphasized that when it comes to the NATO communique that no decisions have been made yet and the language is still actively under discussion ahead of the summit. \u201cWhen the text is on the table and the countries start to negotiate we can see the full picture,\u201d the Eastern European official said. \u201cWe are ready to negotiate; of course we would like to have it be as ambitious as possible.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/us-allies-nato-membership-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_supreme-court-january-6-rioters", "text": "If the Supreme Court\u00a0undermines\u00a0the prosecution of hundreds of people accused of joining the January 6, 2021, US\u00a0Capitol riot, former President Donald Trump and his allies are poised to promote that ruling as a\u00a0rebuke of\u00a0the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to prosecute members of the pro-Trump mob. But even if the court\u2019s conservative majority tosses the felony charge prohibiting individuals from obstructing an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d\u00a0that federal prosecutors have wielded against alleged rioters, the ramifications may be more about politics than about whether people go to jail. The case before the nine\u00a0justices\u00a0grapples with whether the Justice Department went too far when it used a federal obstruction law enacted in response to the\u00a0Enron\u00a0accounting scandal to charge hundreds of people involved in the US Capitol riot. Critics claim the charge, which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years, was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation \u2013 not an insurrection in support of a president who lost reelection. \u201cAttempting to stop a vote count or something like that is a very different act than actually changing a document or altering a document or creating a fake new document,\u201d attorneys for Joseph Fischer, the\u00a0riot defendant\u00a0who brought the case the Supreme Court is considering, argued\u00a0during oral arguments in April. It is not clear how many criminal cases a decision by the justices will affect. Hundreds of people have been charged with obstructing an official proceeding, but most defendants convicted of the charge were also found guilty of additional felony or misdemeanor counts. Only about 50 people have been convicted of and sentenced\u00a0for only obstruction, according to Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. Trump is likely to take any ruling in favor of Fischer to try to further undermine the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of his supporters who stormed the Capitol. The former president has repeatedly asserted that he would consider pardoning those convicted of crimes related to January 6 if reelected, calling them \u201cvictims\u201d who were merely \u201cprotesting a rigged election.\u201d And depending on how the court rules, Trump might also attempt to have that charge thrown out in his own case.\u00a0The former president is facing the same charge as part of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case in Washington, DC. Trump\u2019s allies have already taken to the public stage to call any decision against the Justice Department a win. Before the case was presented to the justices, several Republican lawmakers\u00a0filed a brief to the high court arguing the Justice Department is using the law as an \u201call-purpose weapon against perceived political opponents.\u201d Several of Trump\u2019s vice-presidential hopefuls have called the January 6 prosecutions unjust. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, for example, said last month that rioters are facing the \u201ccomplete weight of the Justice Department \u2026 when, at worst, they are accused of misdemeanors.\u201d The court is expected to rule by the end of the month. Charging decisions and sentences In the January 6 cases, prosecutors have charged people who they believe showed a clear intent to obstruct, or block, Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThat obstruction can often be in terms of talking about voting, talking about ballots, talking about the actual Electoral College and their activities that day, as opposed to just a general \u2018We want Trump to win,\u2019\u201d Louis Manzo, a former federal prosecutor who worked on some of the\u00a0highest-profile cases\u00a0stemming from the January 6 riot, said in an interview with CNN. Manzo said there had to be evidence an individual \u201cknew what was going on inside the Capitol and that they took actions consistent with depriving Congress of their ability to act.\u201d Prelogar articulated that nexus to the justices, saying during oral arguments that prosecutors are required to \u201cshow that the defendants had knowledge that Congress was meeting in the joint session on that day\u201d and \u201cspecifically intended to disrupt the joint proceeding\u201d to secure a conviction on the obstruction charge. Prosecutors have often coupled the obstruction charge with other felonies \u2013 including for assault,\u00a0which also carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, or for civil disorder, which carries a five-year maximum \u2013 against rioters. Any ruling from the justices would not bar prosecutors from continuing to bring those charges, or from advocating for hefty punishments, against Capitol riot defendants. Justice Brett Kavanaugh nodded to this point during the April oral arguments, pushing Prelogar on why other charges levied against defendants alongside obstruction aren\u2019t \u201cgood enough from the Justice Department\u2019s perspective?\u201d \u201cBecause those counts don\u2019t fully reflect the culpability of [defendants\u2019] conduct on January 6,\u201d Prelogar responded. Even in cases in which January 6 defendants were convicted of multiple criminal charges, the average prison sentence was just over four years, a CNN analysis shows \u2013 far less than the 20-year maximum the obstruction count carries. And, according to Prelogar, the average sentence for the defendants convicted of only obstruction has been half that. \u201cAlmost nobody is getting anywhere close to the 20-year statutory maximum that the obstruction charge brings,\u201d Manzo said, adding that the obstruction charge \u201ccarries on paper a lot of weight\u201d but \u201cit doesn\u2019t always carry that much influence as sentencing.\u201d Attorney Carmen Hernandez, who has represented numerous January 6 defendants, said in an interview\u00a0that many defendants who pleaded guilty agreed to waive certain rights about the appeals process, which may bar them from launching extensive challenges to their convictions. Among the most lasting effects of the Supreme Court\u2019s impeding ruling will be that dozens of cases once believed to be settled could return to court to rehash their sentences. \u201cI\u2019m sure the courts are going to be flooded with claims\u201d from defendants who were convicted under the obstruction law, Hernandez said. \u201cThey definitely will have to be heard.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/supreme-court-january-6-rioters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_biden-immigration-executive-action", "text": "The Biden administration on Tuesday announced an executive action allowing certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country \u2013 a sweeping election-year move that could offer deportation protections to hundreds of thousands of people. The action will provide legal status and protections for about 500,000 American families and roughly 50,000 noncitizen children of immigrants under the age of 21 whose parent is married to a US citizen, a senior administration official said. It amounts to one of the federal government\u2019s biggest relief programs for undocumented immigrants since the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was announced by then-President Barack Obama in 2012. The action is aimed at appealing to key Latino constituencies in battleground states, including Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, that will be crucial for Biden\u2019s chances to claim a second term. The move is an olive branch to immigration advocates and progressives, many of whom have sharply criticized Biden for previous restrictive actions, including taking steps this month to limit asylum processing at the US southern border. The president formally announced the action during a White House event Tuesday marking the 12th anniversary of DACA: \u201cToday\u2019s a good day,\u201d Biden said during the event in the White House\u2019s East Room. Under current federal law, an undocumented person who enters the United States and marries a US citizen must first request parole before applying for legal residency. That process requires them to leave the country if they were there illegally, upending their careers and families and creating uncertainty about whether they would be authorized to reenter. Tuesday\u2019s action allows those spouses to apply for residency without needing to leave the United States \u2013 a key change that the Biden administration argues will keep families intact. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on \u201cLaura Coates Live,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas touted Biden\u2019s new executive order. \u201cIt is about family unity. That is an ethic and a value of this country, and we will benefit significantly from it. We will keep families together, families including the undocumented spouses who have contributed so much to this country, in so many different ways,\u201d he said. CNN first reported last week that the administration was considering the move. The executive action is already facing legal challenges, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that the Biden administration believes the action falls \u201csquarely within our legal authorities.\u201d To be eligible for the program, the person must have lived in the United States for at least 10 years and be legally married to a US citizen, according to a White House fact sheet. The application process will open by the end of the summer. Lawful permanent residency, commonly known as obtaining a green card, allows immigrants to live and legally work in the United States. Green card holders cannot vote in federal US elections. Tuesday\u2019s executive action, along with Biden\u2019s immigration policy more b\ufeffroadly, are likely themes in next week\u2019s debate between Biden and his 2024 rival, former President Donald Trump. Biden on Tuesday said he was \u201cnot interested in playing politics\u201d on the border \u2013 but still took an opportunity to slam his predecessor\u2019s policies. \u201cWhen he was president,\u201d Biden said of Trump, \u201che separated families and children at the border. And now he\u2019s proposing to rip spouses and children from their families, homes and communities and place them in detention camps. He\u2019s actually saying these things, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been said, but he\u2019s actually saying these things out loud.\u201d Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement, the Biden campaign sought to contrast Trump\u2019s immigration policies with measures that the Biden administration argues will keep families together. \u201cFamilies belong together \u2013 it\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s why President Biden\u2019s actions today are so important, and it\u2019s also a powerful stark reminder of Donald Trump\u2019s unforgivable legacy of ripping crying children away from their parents when he put in place his family separation policy,\u201d Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. The president teased the move last week while acknowledging many immigration activists have not been happy with some of his actions. \u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you \u2013 be patient,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn the weeks ahead \u2013 and I mean the\u00a0weeks\u00a0ahead \u2013 I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.\u201d Immigration-advocacy groups welcomed news of Biden\u2019s announcement. \u201cBy removing barriers that prevent spouses from staying with their families, he can fulfill his promise to protect those harmed by our broken immigration laws,\u201d Todd Schulte, president of\u00a0immigration-advocacy group FWD.us, said of Biden in a statement. \u201cWe encourage the president to act boldly and with the confidence of knowing Americans across the political spectrum support these responsible protections for individuals who have lived in our communities and proven their contributions to our country for years.\u201d Immigration experts note that individuals affected by the change are already eligible for green cards because of their marital status, but they are now able to apply from inside the US. Previously, individuals had to apply from outside the United States, and \u2013 if they had been in the country unlawfully \u2013 remain outside the US for 10 years. The change in status could impact up to 550,000 individuals, according to the Migration Policy Institute, and allowing those individuals to seek higher-wage jobs could have sizable economic benefit. \u201cWhen you\u2019re unauthorized, it freezes you in the underground economy,\u201d Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, told CNN. \u201cThese are people who have suppressed potential who will be free to work anywhere they want.\u201d Leading Senate Republicans sharply criticized Biden ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement. Republican Whip John Thune accused the administration of creating more \u201cpull factors\u201d with the planned immigration action. \u201cThey are increasing incentive for people to come here illegally,\u201d Thune said. \u201cI am sure they\u2019ll be challenged.\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis, another Republican who has worked on immigration issues in the Senate, told CNN that the better solution would be to find a bipartisan bill. Tillis voted against the bipartisan border security bill earlier this year. Mayorkas\u00a0told CNN that the bipartisan Senate bill \u201cwould have been the most significant transformation of what everyone agrees is a broken immigration system in more than 25 years.\u201d \u201cWe have taken action in the face of congressional inaction repeatedly,\u00a0and that is what is called leadership and that is what the president has exhibited from day one,\u201d Mayorkas added. Some Democrats in the Senate praised Biden\u2019s executive order while those in vulnerable seats tried towing a line. Sen. Elizabeth Warren praised Biden\u2019s decision while conceding his earlier executive order that restricted border crossings was \u201cnot how (I) would have approached it.\u201d \u201cBut I do appreciate that right now what the president is doing is he\u2019s saying families are important to Americans, and that we\u2019re going to do everything we can to protect the spouses of American citizens,\u201d she said. Sen.\u00a0Sherrod Brown, a vulnerable Democrat from Ohio, declined to say if he supports the new executive order. \u201cI do not know enough about this yet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cA good idea is that Congress finally pass the bipartisan border bill to secure the border and to pass an immigration bill. And presidents of both parties have failed and I\u2019m hopeful that we do that and make a real difference,\u201d he added. Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat in a vulnerable seat, also declined to say if he supports Biden\u2019s executive order. \u201cI\u2019ve got to look at what the president \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen the proposal, I\u2019ll wait until I see it,\u201d he told CNN. However, he did praise Biden\u2019s executive order from earlier this month aimed at restricting border crossings. \u201cI think that was the right thing to do, to make that proposal, it\u2019s obviously being challenged,\u201d he said. Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez of Illinois, whose husband is a DACA recipient, said the executive action was welcome news - but added there is still \u201cmore work to do.\u201d \u201cThere are still hundreds of thousands of people still in the shadows who are going to watch the news today and ask themselves does this finally mean that I finally get out of the shadows and for many, not yet,\u201d Ramirez told CNN moments before she joined her husband, Boris, at the White House event for Biden\u2019s announcement. Biden also announced Tuesday that his administration will facilitate the employment-visa process for people who have graduated from college and have a high-skilled job offer.

The twice-impeached 45th president and newly convicted criminal was back on Capitol Hill Thursday for the first time since his supporters beat up police officers and smashed their way through the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. A rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d from House Republicans contrasted with the cries from more than three years ago to \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d from Trump\u2019s mob as they acted on his plea to \u201cfight like hell\u201d after weeks of promoting false claims about election fraud. Keen to please their champion and create an optimistic omen for November, House members paid tribute to the ex-president with a bat and game ball they won after trouncing Democrats in the annual congressional baseball game Wednesday. There was a distinct impression of subordinates paying homage to a strongman leader. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 primary opponent now seen as a potential GOP vice presidential nominee, called it \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d after GOP senators feted Trump a mere two weeks after he became the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. Another 2016 foe of the ex-president, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who endured insults Trump flung at his father and his wife, stood to applaud his vanquisher. But the most striking image from the day was a handshake between McConnell and the ex-president captured in a photo by Doug Mills of The New York Times that sums up an era. The veteran Kentucky senator has never hidden his disdain for Trump, though he has always sought to preserve his own power and didn\u2019t take steps to convict him in Senate trials after his two impeachments. The dislike has been mutual, with the former president blasting McConnell as \u201cthe old crow\u201d at rallies and making racist comments about McConnell\u2019s wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. In January 2021, McConnell said, \u201cThe mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.\u201d He said Trump was morally and practically responsible for the assault on his beloved Capitol. On Thursday, after meeting Trump for the first time since that day of infamy, he lauded their \u201centirely positive\u201d encounter, during which the former president clasped McConnell\u2019s hand in both of his. It would strain credulity that McConnell has shed his private contempt for the ex-president. But he told reporters who asked him about their meeting: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you that was negative.\u201d The exchange between McConnell and Trump was an apt emblem for a day that Trump choreographed to show a coming together in his party \u2013 despite the thousands of votes cast in GOP primaries for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for months after she suspended her campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\u201d the ex-president said. \u201cWe want to see borders. We want to see strong military. We want to see money not wasted all over the world.\u201d How Trump asserts power Trump\u2019s assertion of omnipotence over his party was an example of the power projection he adores, which often requires the subordination of supplicants. And it also showed what Republicans who want their own power are prepared to do to keep it. The pageant of adulation on Capitol Hill was also yet another reminder that there will be no price for Trump to pay in his party for an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power. And it was likely a preview of the deference to Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts and zeal for vengeance that America can expect from Republicans in Washington should he win back the White House \u2013 even from those in a branch of government that is supposed to constrain presidents. Another of Trump\u2019s possible vice-presidential picks, Ohio Sen J.D. Vance, was asked how some senior Republicans who had condemned Trump after January 6 could meet and applaud him now. \u201cNo real Republican with any credibility in the party is still blaming him,\u201d Vance, who had not yet been elected at the time, said, adding that some of Trump\u2019s critics in the room were supportive. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing and the Republican Party is in a good place.\u201d Vance is not wrong. Almost every major Republican who stood up to Trump in 2021 is gone or on the way out of the door. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is retiring. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was driven out of House leadership and then Congress for telling the truth about his election lies. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan harshly criticized Trump this week for breaking his oath of office to uphold the Constitution. But his comments on Fox News came amid a comfortable retirement, all his ambition long gone. Lawmakers who stood alongside Trump on Thursday did not necessarily do it because they like him. His huge popularity in the grassroots GOP means that they know that they can say goodbye to their political futures if they choose not to. This is even the case when Trump\u2019s deportment insults the normal codes of behavior expected of a presidential nominee. Biden speaks of democracy abroad while Trump undermines it at home Trump\u2019s return to Washington came the day before he turned 78, the age at which President Joe Biden \u2014 whom his predecessor says is too old to serve \u2014 took office after beating him in the 2020 election. Their 2024 rematch is neck-and-neck, according to polls, with each seeking to make the contest a referendum on the other\u2019s single term. Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to try to exploit Trump\u2019s return visit to a city he left scarred and traumatized by the Capitol riot, releasing a new campaign video that showed scenes of the assault. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more sacred than our democracy, but Donald Trump\u2019s ready to burn it all down,\u201d a narrator said in the ad, which is airing in battleground states. Biden, 81, was thousands of miles away from Washington when Trump showed up, participating in the G7 summit in Italy. It\u2019s the second foreign trip in two weeks he is using an as allegory for a US presidential season he is trying to cast as a fight to save American democracy. Unveiling a series of new plans to boost Ukraine diplomatically, militarily and economically, the president recalled that the US and its allies had been repeatedly asked whether they\u2019d stand firm for a country that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to wipe off the map. \u201cWe will say it again, yes, again and again and again we\u2019re going to stand with Ukraine,\u201d Biden said, as he stood with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A flurry of initiatives to institutionalize Western support for Ukraine being unveiled at the summit are a clear effort to hedge against the possibility that Trump could return to power on January 20, 2025. The ex-president frequently cozied up to Putin while in office and has said he\u2019d end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours \u2014 a feat that could only be achieved by locking in Russia\u2019s territorial gains after its brutal invasion Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton warned on Thursday that Biden could not guarantee that the 10-year pact that covers military training, intelligence cooperation and other areas that he signed with Zelensky on Thursday would last. \u201cI think it is illusory, though, for anyone to think Trump would be bound by it. If Trump is inaugurated at noon on January 20 next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,\u201d Bolton told Bianna Golodryga on CNN International. If Trump gets elected and does walk away from Ukraine, he will complete the transformation of a Republican Party that once prided itself in standing up for democracy worldwide and that, under President Ronald Reagan, won the Cold War. \u201cYou can\u2019t bind a future president who doesn\u2019t want to be bound,\u201d Bolton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_abortion-eeoc-rule-louisiana-mississippi", "text": "A judge paused in two Southern states a new federal mandate that employers give workers seeking elective abortions time off to obtain and recover from the procedure. US District Judge David C. Joseph in a Monday\u00a0order\u00a0partially halted the new rule being\u00a0implemented by\u00a0the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying\u00a0the agency had exceeded the authority given to it by Congress in putting forward the regulation.\u00a0The rule is set to take effect Tuesday, but Joseph has blocked the agency from enforcing it in Louisiana and Mississippi, while the states\u2019 legal challenge to the regulation plays out. Joseph\u2019s order also halts the enforcement of the rule against four Catholic entities that brought their own lawsuit. In April, the EEOC released the final rule under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which Congress passed as part of a broader federal spending package in 2022. The act, which became law a year ago, requires that workplaces make certain accommodations for pregnant employees \u201crelated to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions\u201d and applies to employers with at least 15 workers unless the accommodations would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d for the employer. The final regulation clarified the provisions of the act, including the controversial measure to include abortion in the act\u2019s definition of \u201cpregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions\u201d \u2013 which sparked a flurry of comments to the commission, with about 54,000 of them urging the agency to exclude abortion and about 40,000 comments asking to include it. \u201cIf Congress had intended to mandate that employers accommodate elective abortions under the PWFA, it would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time (and, indeed, over the past 50 years),\u201d Joseph, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said in his opinion. The judge said his preliminary injunction did not apply to \u201cterminations of pregnancy or abortions stemming from the underlying treatment of a medical condition related to pregnancy.\u201d When it issued the final rule, the EEOC noted that the law cannot be used to require a job-based health plan to pay for any procedure, including an abortion. It specified that the act is a workplace anti-discrimination law. The act provides pregnant and postpartum workers with a variety of protections, including time off for recovery from childbirth, prenatal or postnatal appointments and postpartum depression and accommodations related to seating, light duty, breaks for food, water and restroom needs, breastfeeding and miscarriage. Employers are not required to offer paid time off. \u201cIn its ruling, the court disregarded decades of legal precedent. \u2018Related medical conditions\u2019 to pregnancy have long been interpreted to include abortion,\u201d Dina Bakst, co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization, said in a statement. \u201cIt is important for pregnant and postpartum workers to understand that this ruling does not mean their rights under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act have been taken away, and that the ruling does not affect the rest of the regulations.\u201d Monday\u2019s order comes on the heels of a\u00a0Friday ruling\u00a0by an Arkansas federal judge that dismissed a challenge to the new abortion rule brought by Arkansas and 16 other states. The judge in that case, Obama-appointed US District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr., cited last week\u2019s\u00a0Supreme Court opinion\u00a0in a major challenge to abortion pill access\u00a0and said that the states lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_supreme-court-trump-immunity", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s most closely watched dispute this year \u2013 a case questioning whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges \u2013 also has the potential to be one of the hardest to parse for meaning in real time. In between Trump\u2019s initial demand for total immunity and an appeals court ruling earlier this year that found he\u2019s entitled to no protection at all is a murky gap with massive practical implications for whether he can be tried before the November election. At issue is special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution of Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election, including with his actions on January 6, 2021, though the court\u2019s decision could have implications for other criminal cases against Trump as well. In addition to the bottom line ruling about whether Trump is immune from prosecution could be important clues about how quickly the matter will go to trial. \u201cTrump has already won something,\u201d said Jonathan Entin, a professor at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cAs a practical matter, Trump has gained time here, regardless of how the court decides the case.\u201d  The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is expected by the end of the month. Here\u2019s a look at some possible outcomes and what those decisions could mean for the timing of a trial. Trump\u2019s out of luck: No immunity The simplest outcome would be for the Supreme Court to rule that former presidents are not entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution.  That was the conclusion the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit reached in February in a unanimous opinion. That ruling could allow Trump\u2019s trial to get underway almost immediately. \u201cFor the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,\u201d the three-judge panel of the appeals court wrote. \u201cBut any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\u201d But if the Supreme Court agreed with that approach, it probably wouldn\u2019t have taken up Trump\u2019s appeal in the first place. During oral arguments on April 25, several of the court\u2019s centrist conservatives \u2013 notably Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 made clear that they didn\u2019t agree with the appeals court\u2019s approach. \u201cAs I read it, it says simply a former president can be prosecuted because he\u2019s being prosecuted,\u201d Roberts said derisively during the arguments. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we either send it back to the court of appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that\u2019s not the law?\u201d It\u2019s also clear that many of the court\u2019s conservatives want to address issues that are much broader than the specifics of Trump\u2019s case.  Justice Neil Gorsuch framed the court\u2019s task as \u201cwriting a rule for the ages.\u201d Kavanaugh said the court\u2019s decision would have implications for the \u201cfuture of the presidency\u201d and the \u201cthe future of the country.\u201d Neither of those statements speak to a limited ruling \u2013 or a quick outcome in Trump\u2019s specific case. Nixon and the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of power But the justices could reach more broadly by granting some degree of immunity for \u201cofficial\u201d actions. Based on the oral arguments, it appeared there was support for doing so. That outcome would raise a number of substantial questions, including what counts as an \u201cofficial\u201d action. Trump based most of his argument on a 1982 decision called Nixon v. Fitzgerald in which the Supreme Court ruled that presidents enjoy \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from civil lawsuits for official actions to the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of their duties. The case involved a former Air Force employee,\u00a0A. Ernest Fitzgerald, who was fired after he provided damaging testimony to Congress about production problems with the C-5A transport plane. Fitzgerald tried to sue former President Richard Nixon for damages. Trump now argues that the civil immunity the Supreme Court granted former presidents in the Fitzgerald case should apply to criminal prosecutions of former presidents as well. If the court embraced that approach, it wouldn\u2019t end Smith\u2019s case, but it could seriously delay a trial. It would also refocus attention on another debate: How much of Trump\u2019s post-election actions were official conduct as opposed to private actions. How Trump can \u2018lose by winning\u2019 No matter what the majority of the Supreme Court decides about immunity for official conduct, at least a portion of the charges against Trump could proceed if some of his actions were private \u2013 that is, steps he took as a candidate or private citizen rather than as a president. That official-versus-private debate emerged as a key component of Trump\u2019s immunity battle and will be closely scrutinized once the opinion lands. Trump\u2019s lawyer conceded during the argument that many of the actions his client took were private, such as asking his attorney Rudy Giuliani to spread false election fraud claims. If the court makes clear that some of Trump\u2019s actions were private and not covered by any official act immunity, that could speed the path to a trial. \u201cTrump can win by losing by running out the clock,\u201d said Matthew Seligman, an attorney and a fellow at the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School who co-wrote a piece for\u00a0Just Security\u00a0gaming out potential outcomes in the case and an amicus brief supporting Smith\u2019s position. \u201cBut he can also lose by winning, because even if the court adopts his rule he still goes to trial because a critical set of his conduct is indisputably unofficial.\u201d\u00a0 Sending it back for trial The Supreme Court\u2019s decision could explicitly make clear that some of Trump\u2019s actions were private. Or it could set a standard for lower courts to use to decide what\u2019s official and what\u2019s not. How the justices deal with that will determine how quickly \u2013 or whether \u2013 Smith\u2019s case can proceed. \u201cOne option is the court itself says: \u2018These are official; these are private. These get immunity; these don\u2019t. The end,\u201d said Alison LaCroix, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School who is also a scholar of legal history. \u201cAnother option is the court lays out a standard for immunity \u2026 and tells the trial court, \u2018You figure out whether these were official or unofficial,\u201d she said. Under that scenario, the justices would send the case back to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan so she or a jury could decide which actions are private \u2013 and prosecutable. In terms of timing, a lot would depend on the direction the Supreme Court gives Chutkan in its opinion. If determinations about what counts as private versus public action must be made before a trial begins, that could dash Smith\u2019s timeline. It could also raise the possibility of further pre-trial legal wrangling, unless the Supreme Court explicitly ruled out appeals of those decisions. \u201cMost likely they will send the case back \u2013 probably, ultimately, to the district court \u2013 to resolve which aspects of the charges involve actions that are within the president\u2019s official duties, and which are not,\u201d Entin said. And that, he said, would likely mean no quick answers for Trump or Smith. \u201cA lot of it depends on how they write it,\u201d said LaCroix, who recently published a book that explores historic legal cases influencing modern controversies, including immunity. \u201cNobody likes \u2018we\u2019ll see,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut on some level, that\u2019s where we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_donald-trump-wisconsin-election", "text": "Days after reportedly calling Milwaukee \u201chorrible\u201d behind closed doors, former President Donald Trump will rally with his supporters just south of the city in one of the country\u2019s top battleground states. Trump\u2019s event Tuesday comes less than a month before Republicans gather in Milwaukee for their national convention, where they will nominate the former president for the third time in eight years. At a meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill last week, Trump referred to his party\u2019s chosen convention host city as \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. The Trump campaign pushed back on some of the public characterization of the alleged remark, saying he was referring to crime and \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d As his alleged comment reverberated around the Badger State, Trump clarified to a Fox News reporter, \u201cI love Milwaukee. I have great friends in Milwaukee\u201d before also criticizing crime there and the city\u2019s stewardship of elections. Milwaukee \u2013 in addition to the state capital of Madison \u2013 is a center of Democratic power in Wisconsin and home to more voters than any other city in the state. One in five of the votes for Joe Biden en route to his narrow Wisconsin victory in 2020 were cast in Milwaukee. The city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Cavalier Johnson, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates last week that Trump\u2019s alleged remark could prove to be a tactical error. \u201cIn a state that\u2019s decided on a razor\u2019s edge, that may ultimately cost Donald Trump the election,\u201d Johnson said. Democrats have tried to capitalize on the incident to rally support for Biden around the state\u2019s largest city. The Democratic National Committee said Friday it had launched 10 billboards across Milwaukee featuring Trump\u2019s alleged remark. The Biden campaign has begun selling T-shirts and stickers with Milwaukee on a Wisconsin outline and the words: \u201c(Not) a Horrible City.\u201d \u201cI happen to love Milwaukee,\u201d Biden posted on social media Thursday, along with a picture with the Milwaukee Bucks after the team\u2019s NBA championship win in 2021. A focus on crime Trump made crime in major cities a central pillar of his successful 2016 White House bid, and Milwaukee was a poster child for his \u201claw and order\u201d campaign against urban violence. During an appearance just outside the city that year, Trump asserted to a suburban crowd, \u201cThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t come close to winning Milwaukee, but he trounced Democrat Hillary Clinton in the surrounding suburban counties that have become influential in deciding statewide races in Wisconsin. That success helped him become the first Republican presidential nominee to carry Wisconsin since 1988. Both Biden and Trump aggressively campaigned for votes of Wisconsinites during the 2020 election, which ended with Biden winning the state by less than half a point. This year, Trump has once again made crime a central focus of his campaign. In announcing the trip to Racine, the Trump team blamed Biden\u2019s polices for \u201cspiked crime across Wisconsin\u201d and asserted that Milwaukee was \u201cexperiencing the biggest increase in shootings in the country.\u201d But a recent New York Times/Siena College poll from Wisconsin found that less than 1% of registered voters said crime was a top concern as they weigh their presidential options. Meanwhile, violent crime this year is down and murder rates are plunging nationwide, the FBI said earlier this month. Trump\u2019s appearance in Racine marks his second to southeast Wisconsin in less than two months, underscoring the importance of the region in the battle ahead. Two of Biden\u2019s four trips to Wisconsin this year have also put him in the same corner of the Badger State. One of those included an official White House visit to Racine just 20 minutes from where Trump will hold his rally Tuesday. On that visit, Biden spoke at a site where his predecessor once promoted an investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that later failed. \u201cFoxconn turned out to be just that \u2013 a con,\u201d Biden said. \u201cGo figure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/donald-trump-wisconsin-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In that same meeting,\u00a0US Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew also reiterated to Netanyahu that his comments\u00a0were not correct, walking through all of the arms\u00a0the US has transferred to Israel in recent months, according\u00a0to two senior US officials. A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Israel\u00a0confirmed\u00a0that Lew spoke with Netanyahu on Tuesday. The spokesperson reiterated that \u201cwith the exception of ongoing discussion regarding large diameter munitions, other items are either delivered or in the process of being delivered, or in the normal review process.\u201d Axios first reported on the exchange\u00a0between Hochstein and Netanyahu. The meeting reflected the administration\u2019s\u00a0mounting\u00a0frustration with the Israeli\u00a0leader\u2019s\u00a0comments. Another\u00a0senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0CNN that the public statement from the Israeli prime minister was \u201cperplexing\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d This is not the first time Netanyahu has publicly lambasted the Biden administration\u00a0in the course of the Israel-Hamas war, but this week\u2019s public dispute comes as the stakes around the war in Gaza and a potential further conflict between Israel and Hezbollah remain incredibly high. Both the Israeli\u00a0prime\u00a0minister and the President Joe Biden are facing\u00a0growing political pressure\u00a0at home over their handling of the war. Hochstein\u2019s comments to Netanyahu weren\u2019t the first time US officials have pushed back in private against public comments made by Netanyahu, but some US officials would like the Biden administration to go further, an administration official said. That frustration appears to have led to the US postponing one meeting of the US-Israel\u00a0Strategic Consultative Group (SDG) initially slated for Thursday, where Iran was one of the agenda items,\u00a0according to a senior administration official. But that official and a White House official disputed that the meeting was moved in response to comments made by Netanyahu and\u00a0stressed that it had never been firmed up. Meetings between US and Israeli officials this week,including on Wednesday,\u00a0are set to continue, according to the first official, and the Thursday meeting in question is likely to be rescheduled \u2013 possibly for as early as next week Still, a different senior US official insisted that the Thursday meeting was taken off the schedule to send a message to\u00a0Netanyahu, similar to how the Israeli leader canceled a visit to the US in March by a delegation in protest at a US abstention on a key UN vote, the official said. \u201cWe have been working to find a time to schedule the next SDG that\u00a0accounts for the travel and availability of principals,\u00a0but have not yet fully finalized the details so nothing has been cancelled,\u201d a White House official told CNN. \u201cIn the meantime, meetings with Israeli officials are being held throughout the week at expert and senior levels on a range of topics. As we said in the briefing yesterday, we have no idea what the Prime Minister is talking about, but that\u2019s not a reason for rescheduling a meeting.\u201d Netanyahu publicly claimed the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons\u201d in a video posted to X on Tuesday, claiming that Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cassured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks.\u201d The top US diplomat refused to discuss his conversation with Netanyahu last week, saying he was \u201cnot going to talk about what we said in diplomatic conversations.\u201d \u201cI can just say, again, that we have a commitment to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against a whole variety of threats,\u201d he\u00a0said at a news conference Tuesday. He also confirmed that one shipment of heavy bombs remains on hold. \u201cWe continue to move these different cases through our system on regular order,\u201d Blinken said, noting that \u201cit takes a long time to move these things, and a number of the things that are going to Israel won\u2019t get there for years.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/biden-envoytold-netanyhau-his-commentsabout-us-supplied-weapons-unproductive-andwerecompletely-untrue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_bannon-trump-election-what-matters", "text": "Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist in the White House, used the language of war to fire up a conservative gathering over the weekend, promising to remake the US government and completely deconstruct the FBI. Comparing the presidential campaign to the D-Day invasion, Bannon encouraged a cheering crowd at the Turning Point Action convention in Detroit to see themselves as filling the positions of fallen soldiers in an assault. \u2018War to the knife\u2019 \u201cAre we at war?\u201d he asked the crowd. \u201cIs this a political war to the knife?\u201d I was not familiar with that term \u2013 \u201cwar to the knife\u201d \u2013 but Bannon also recently used it in an interview with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. A Google search yielded a 1998 book by that name about the Bleeding Kansas skirmishes in the years before the Civil War when pro- and anti-slavery settlers flooded into Kansas and feuded over whether Kansas should enter the union as a free or slave state. The book, according to its description, attributes the term to the Atchison Squatter Sovereign, which the Library of Congress describes as a pro-slavery newspaper of the era. It\u2019s not clear where Bannon got the term. \u201cAre you prepared to leave it all on the battlefield in 2024?\u201d he asked of Turning Point activists. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple: victory or death!\u201d he later added. The Trump campaign, which has spent large portions of fundraising on the former president\u2019s legal bills, has indicated it will rely on organizations like Turning Point Action to mobilize young activists, get out the vote in November and also to challenge votes of their opponents.

The stakes of the election must be extremely high from Bannon\u2019s perspective. Already pardoned by Trump for his role in a scheme to allegedly defraud donors of contributions intended to help build a border wall, Bannon was subsequently convicted by a jury in 2022 of the rarely prosecuted crime of contempt of Congress. Bannon refused to cooperate with subpoenas from the committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection when Democrats controlled Congress. After delays, Bannon must begin serving a four-month prison sentence starting next month. While Bannon was not part of Trump\u2019s official world for most of his presidential term, he is influential on the far right. Appearing later at the Turning Point Action event, Trump described Bannon as a \u201csmart cookie\u201d and told the crowd he tries to watch Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d broadcast whenever he can. Ousted from White House role in 2017 Bannon\u2019s tenure in Trump\u2019s White House was relatively short; he was fired in August 2017, part of a major reorganization under then-chief of staff John Kelly, who was brought in to control a chaotic atmosphere. In the years since, Bannon has continued to advocate for Trump \u2013 and Kelly, a retired general, has sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s possible reelection. Bannon, meanwhile, now sounds like a more militant version of Trump, such as when he emphatically accuses Trump\u2019s opponents of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. There\u2019s no evidence for any kind of mass voter fraud, but that will not end this conspiracy theory. \u201cIf they steal this election \u2013 and they fully intend to steal it \u2013 this republic ends,\u201d Bannon said, before going on a riff about how top Department of Justice officials in President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, like Attorney General Merrick Garland, should be prosecuted; the FBI should be completely deconstructed; and anyone convicted in connection to the storming of the Capitol building would be set free. \u2018Purge\u2019 the DOJ, end the FBI \u201cWe are going to purge DOJ. We are going to take apart the FBI. The FBI, the American Gestapo \u2026 there\u2019s not going to be an FBI,\u201d he said. While Trump has only said he would be justified in going after political opponents, Bannon is committed to targeting anyone he views as having opposed Trump. \u201cWe are going to get every single receipt, and to the fullest extension of the law, you are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d he said. Preparing for a second term It is clear Bannon is looking well past Election Day as he rattled off a list of priorities for the MAGA movement. These included cutting off funding to Ukraine, massive cuts to government spending, beginning the process of ending the Federal Reserve, sealing the southern border, deporting 10 million to 15 million people and taking apart the administrative state. As chief strategist at the White House, Bannon was known for large whiteboards full of lists of priorities \u2013 things that still ring true in the priorities he outlined over the weekend. Courts, Congress and mismanagement kept Bannon and Trump from achieving many of these goals in Trump\u2019s first term. Clearly, Bannon is hoping for more success in a round two, particularly since the moderating forces of people like Kelly are unlikely to be involved in the administration. Bannon is not alone in planning for drastic changes if Trump wins in November. Anticipating the potential for a second Trump term, there are any number of supporters who are mapping out how to make the most of it. The conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, for instance, has written up its Project 2025 road map to remaking the civil service by firing large numbers of career servants and replacing them with more political voices. For a good, in-depth look at what Project 2025 would and would not do, listen this recent \u201cIn the Room\u201d podcast from Peter Bergen, CNN\u2019s national security analyst. Bergen talks to one of the authors of the State Department portion of Project 2025. Those plans from groups like Heritage, while plenty scary to an entire class of civil servants, sound relatively anodyne compared with Bannon\u2019s language. \u201cAre you prepared to fight? Are you prepared to give it all?\u201d he asked of young activists, telling them they would have to follow in the footsteps of \u201cthe team around President Trump\u201d \u2013 who he views as Roger Stone, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Alex Jones, people whose fidelity to conspiracy theories has gotten them into legal and financial trouble, but who in Bannon\u2019s mind are political freedom fighters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/bannon-trump-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Trump said it was his choice to have Milwaukee host the Republican National Convention this summer. \u201cI was the one that picked it,\u201d the former president said. \u201cThese lying people. They say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t like Milwaukee.\u2019 I love Milwaukee. I said we\u2019ve got to fix the crime. We all know that. You\u2019ve got to make sure the election is honest, but I\u2019m the one who picked Milwaukee.\u201d Trump accused Democrats of lying because they have a \u201chorrible candidate\u201d who has \u201cno clue\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know where he is,\u201d referring to President Joe Biden. \u201cI think you had about 10 congressmen in a meeting that we had recently where I said how much I like Milwaukee. That\u2019s all what they said,\u201d he said. At a closed-door meeting Thursday with House Republicans on Capitol Hill, the former president called Milwaukee \u201chorrible\u201d during a rant about crime rates and so-called election integrity, according to a source in the room. Several members of Wisconsin\u2019s congressional delegation later confirmed that Trump used the word \u201chorrible\u201d when talking about Milwaukee in the context of crime and elections. Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \u201cspecifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\u201d and not the city itself. The city was a center of Trump and his allies\u2019 election conspiracies in 2020.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/donald-trump-milwaukee-racine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
