{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-trump-rfk", "text": "The public lashing Dr. Anthony Fauci faced on Capitol Hill Monday was illustrative of his enduring unpopularity with the GOP\u2019s conservative base. Yet even as Republicans seek to capitalize on that dislike of the infectious disease expert, former President Donald Trump\u2019s past elevation of Fauci is a potential vulnerability as he fights off an insurgent independent campaign from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Increasingly, Kennedy\u2019s third-party White House bid is gaining traction\u00a0by attacking Trump\u2019s Covid-19\u00a0policies. He has, for example, accused Trump of \u201cinventing lockdowns\u201d and has questioned the safety of the Covid vaccine his administration helped develop. Kennedy\u00a0has also jabbed Trump over his reliance on Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He recently launched a line of merchandise tying Trump and Fauci together. \u201cVote for Trump/Fauci 2024,\u201d the new campaign shirts say, along with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: \u201cGive us another shot!\u201d Trump has attempted to downplay Fauci\u2019s role in his administration. In an interview last month with Tim Pool, a podcaster favored by the far right, Trump claimed Fauci \u201cwasn\u2019t a big player in my administration like he was after I left when Biden made him the king of everything.\u201d At Monday\u2019s House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Republicans didn\u2019t mention Trump in their grilling of Fauci \u2014 his first public testimony on the Hill since retiring. But Trump\u2019s party increasingly has made Fauci an avatar of the retribution they are seeking if the Republican returns to office. At the macro-level, his supporters have proposed ideas that would make it easier to fire federal workers, like Fauci. Trump has repeatedly suggested he couldn\u2019t fire Fauci during his term because of laws that protect career civil servants. At one point during Monday\u2019s hearing, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia asserted that Fauci \u201cbelongs in prison\u201d over his time leading the country\u2019s pandemic response, a sentiment that has been echoed by other members of Congress and online by other Trump supporters. After the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, thanked Fauci for his years of service Monday, Laura Loomer, a conservative provocateur who operates on the edges of Trump\u2019s political operation, posted on social media: \u201cDr. Fauci is a criminal and needs to be treated like one. Not be thanked by the REPUBLICAN CHAIR of the Select subcommittee on coronavirus.\u201d Kennedy has given quarter to these views. In a recent interview, when conservative commentator Glenn Beck asked him, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t (Fauci) in jail?\u201d Kennedy responded, \u201cHe\u2019s not in jail because Joe Biden is president.\u201d Kennedy isn\u2019t the first to use Fauci in an attempt to drive a wedge between Trump and his base. During the GOP primary, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis regularly invoked the longtime public health expert to attack Trump from the right, noting the former president gave Fauci a commendation on his last day in office. Trumped claimed he didn\u2019t know who gave Fauci the commendation, leading DeSantis to joke: \u201cIs this the immaculate commendation or something like that? Did this just happen out of thin air?\u201d But DeSantis\u2019 efforts ultimately failed to make a dent in Trump\u2019s support with the GOP base. While Kennedy faces an uphill climb to get on the ballot in every state, polling suggests he has nevertheless become a problem for Trump as he centers his campaign around vaccines and the coronavirus response. One recent poll from Monmouth University showed support for Kennedy among Republicans grew slightly\u00a0once they learned of his views on vaccines and Covid. It\u2019s just one datapoint, though it explains the urgency of Trump\u2019s recent attacks on Kennedy. David Robertson, a 50-year-old San Antonio\u00a0real estate developer, voted for Trump in 2020, but told CNN he switched to Kennedy after hearing the independent candidate talk about Covid on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. \u201cI just felt like we were misled, you know, and a lot of ways and a lot of stuff that we were told that wasn\u2019t true, we\u2019ve now found out that it is true,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cTowards the end with Covid, the way he handled it, with the lockdowns and everything else, I felt like he just kind of bowed down to what he was told to do.\u201d In the face of this rising threat, Trump has lately stepped up his attacks on Kennedy, labeling him an \u201cextreme liberal\u201d and \u201cfake anti-vaxxer\u201d in a video posted to social media last month.\u00a0Kennedy is a leading purveyor of anti-vaccine misinformation and has long espoused unfounded views of inoculations that doctors and medical authorities have easily debunked. \u201cRFK\u2019s views on vaccines are fake, as is everything else about his candidacy,\u201d the former president said in the video. Trump has long had a fraught relationship with the Covid vaccine, one of the most consequential achievements of his four years in office. As it became less popular among Republicans, Trump stopped mentioning the vaccine. Amid DeSantis\u2019 criticism and Kennedy\u2019s rise, he started telling crowds he would not give \u201cone penny\u201d to a school that requires students to get a Covid vaccine or wear a mask. In a recent interview with Time, Trump both touted the development of the Covid vaccine through Operation Warp Speed while also declining to say if he would push vaccines so aggressively if given the chance again. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a lot of credit for Operation Warp Speed. But most of that credit has come from Democrats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think a big portion of Republicans agree with it, too. But a lot of them don\u2019t want to say it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-trump-rfk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_takeaways-garlands-testimony-judiciary-committee", "text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland appeared defiant Tuesday as he spent hours fielding questions from lawmakers on a range of topics, occasionally sparring with Republican House members seeking to use his testimony to attack the Justice Department. Over the course of a roughly five-hour-long hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Garland defended the department\u2019s work and role in several high-profile criminal cases, including those brought against former President Donald Trump and Hunter Biden. Garland\u2019s testimony comes as Republican lawmakers have argued that the Justice Department is being weaponized against\u00a0conservatives\u00a0and\u00a0just a few weeks after the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee and Oversight Committee voted to\u00a0advance contempt proceedings\u00a0against\u00a0the attorney general\u00a0for his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur. \u201cI view contempt as a serious matter,\u201d Garland said at one point on Tuesday. \u201cBut I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\u201d Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s hearing: \u2018I will not be intimidated\u2019 Garland devoted a considerable part of his opening remarks to making clear that he was unmoved by the \u201cunprecedented\u201d attacks lobbed on his department in recent months. \u201cThese repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented, and they are unfounded,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cI will not be intimidated, and the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs, free from political influence, and we will not back down from defending democracy.\u201d \u201cNothing will deter me from fulfilling my obligation to uphold the rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cFulfilling that obligation includes ensuring that the Justice Department respects Congress\u2019 important role in our democracy.\u201d Garland said that while the department will not provide the audio recordings sought by the GOP lawmakers, it has \u201cgone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the committee gets responses to its legitimate requests for information,\u201d including providing transcripts of the interview with Biden. The DOJ has argued that\u00a0the specific privacy concerns related to\u00a0an audio recording of an interview\u00a0are\u00a0distinct from those of a written transcript, and how the release of such an audio file could dissuade cooperation from future witnesses in criminal investigations. CNN has sued for access to\u00a0recordings of federal investigators\u2019 interview with Biden\u00a0in the now-closed probe over his handling of classified documents. Hush money case looms large Trump\u2019s conviction last week in the New York hush money case loomed large during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Lawmakers repeatedly brought it up, and Garland emphasized that DOJ is \u201ccompletely independent\u201d from the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office. House Republicans have continued to claim without evidence that Biden has used his DOJ to target Trump, including through the New York case. \u201cThe Manhattan District Attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law,\u201d Garland said. \u201cWe do not control the Manhattan District Attorney,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Manhattan District Attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan District Attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\u201d A New York jury convicted Trump last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment scheme he helped facilitate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Defending Jack Smith\u2019s appointment During one particularly tense exchange on Tuesday,\u00a0Committee\u00a0Chairman Jim Jordan pressed Garland on his choice of Jack Smith to serve as special counsel in the Justice Department\u2019s probes into Trump. Those probes eventually led Smith to bring two criminal cases against the former president in Washington, DC, and Florida. \u201cI appointed somebody who is not a political appointee. Somebody who was independent, nonpartisan with a record of career experience as a prosecutor. That seemed to me the perfect resume,\u201d Garland said during the testy back and forth Jordan. \u201cDid he ask for the job?\u201d the Ohio Republican asked at one point. \u201cThis is not a job \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody asks for,\u201d Garland replied with a laugh. Later, Jordan asked Garland if he regretted picking Smith. \u201cNo, I do not regret picking him,\u201d Garland shot back. The Hunter Biden split screen As the hearing unfolded on Capitol Hill, jurors in Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial in Delaware heard opening statements in the case. Appearing to seize on the split screen moment, some lawmakers used their time to bring up the president\u2019s son and his legal woes. When GOP Rep. Ben Cline asked Garland if he spoke with the president\u2019s son when they were both in attendance at a state dinner at the White House in May, Garland said, \u201cI have never spoken to Hunter Biden in my life as far as I know.\u201d Garland also denied various accusations that Cline brought forward about DOJ\u2019s handling of the case into the president\u2019s son and maintained that he cannot discuss ongoing legal cases. When asked if he attempted to obstruct the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, Garland said, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d Democratic push back For their part, Democrats spent much of their time heaping praise on the Justice Department and defending its actions amid attacks on the DOJ from their Republican colleagues. As House Republicans repeatedly accused DOJ of improperly targeting allies of Trump, Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu listed off people around Trump who were prosecuted under the previous Republican administration. Those individuals included Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, former lawyer Michael Cohen, former advisor Roger Stone, fundraiser Elliott Broidy \u2013 all of whom were prosecuted under attorneys general nominated by Trump himself. \u201cIt is not the fault of the Department of Justice that Donald Trump has surrounded himself with criminals,\u201d Lieu said. \u201cTrump brought that upon himself.\u201d Lieu also noted that President Biden\u2019s son Hunter is being prosecuted \u201cin federal court right now\u201d by Garland\u2019s Justice Department.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/takeaways-garlands-testimony-judiciary-committee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_supreme-court-genovese-crime-family-gun-charge-appeal", "text": "The Supreme Court agreed Monday to take up an appeal from Salvatore Delligatti, a Genovese crime family associate who is challenging a 2018 conviction on a gun charge that added five years to his prison sentence. Delligatti was convicted of attempted murder, among other crimes, for hatching a plot to murder a local \u201cbully\u201d who was \u201cterrorizing\u201d a gas station that Delligatti and his associates frequented. Delligatti hired members of the Crips gang through an intermediary to carry out the killing, court records show, and gave them a .38 revolver. Police intercepted the gang members before they were able to carry out the killing. Delligatti was convicted of several crimes and sentenced to 25 years in prison \u2013 including five years for the gun charge. That charge was based on a federal law that prohibits people from possessing a gun as part of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Delligatti, also known as \u201cFat Sal,\u201d argues the underlying crime in his case doesn\u2019t qualify as a crime of violence. Federal appeals courts have split over how to apply the charge in similar circumstances and the Justice Department \u2013 though it opposes Delligatti\u2019s argument in his case \u2013 agreed that the Supreme Court should take up his appeal to provide clarity for lower courts. The Supreme Court in recent years has limited the circumstances under which prosecutors may seek enhanced prison sentences for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d In a decision Delligatti relies on heavily in his appeal, a 7-2 majority of the Supreme Court two years ago ruled in favor of a Virginia defendant who was convicted of the gun charge for using a gun in an attempted robbery. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Delligatti\u2019s conviction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/supreme-court-genovese-crime-family-gun-charge-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_fbi-bob-menendez-steakhouse-dinner", "text": "Steaks, cigars, booze, diplomats and pals \u2013 they were all on the menu at Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s frequent dinners at Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse in Washington DC, according to two FBI investigators who testified Tuesday in the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s federal corruption trial. FBI investigative specialist Terry Williams Thompson, who eavesdropped on one of the meals on May 21, 2019, told the court she heard a woman ask another unidentified diner, \u201cWhat else can the love of my life do for you?\u201d While it wasn\u2019t clear to whom the question was directed, the implication was clear: Nadine Menendez, the senator\u2019s wife, was the person asking. Throughout the trial, she has been heard over voicemail and seen in text messages addressing her husband with similar language. Bob and Nadine Menendez, along with New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. The trial in New York federal court is in its fourth week, and prosecutors have started to piece together different threads of the complex bribery scheme they\u2019ve alleged. The testimony about FBI surveillance adds another dimension to the prosecution\u2019s case, which also includes gold bars seized from the Menendez home, Nadine Menendez\u2019s text messages and other testimony. As he left court Tuesday, Bob Menendez told CNN in an interview that he feels confident his defense attorneys are \u201cshowing the truth\u201d by discrediting prosecution witnesses through cross-examination. A \u2018friendly\u2019 dinner Before the jury was seated Tuesday, Adam Fee, one of Bob Menendez\u2019s attorneys, argued that prosecutors were unfairly attempting to paint the May 2019 dinner as something malign \u2013 as co-conspirators plotting their crimes. According to Fee, the senator was a regular at the steakhouse, going there 250 nights out of the year. \u201cThere is nothing unusual about having dinner there with a diplomat or with a friend,\u201d Fee told Judge Sidney Stein. Prosecutors, in turn, argued that just because the senator had other dinners that were not conspiratorial or criminal in nature, doesn\u2019t mean that some didn\u2019t fit that bill. There were several FBI teams at Morton\u2019s that night who were looking out for other subjects at dinner with the senator. The government\u2019s first witness on Tuesday, Chase Hunter Mills, now an FBI special agent, testified that he saw two men and one woman, with blonde hair and wearing a tan fur overcoat, enter Morton\u2019s steakhouse on the night in question. \u201cThe proximity and the body language would lead me to believe they were friendly together,\u201d he said. Mills testified he did not observe Bob Menendez that night and does not know if the group left the restaurant together or separately. Thompson, the FBI investigative specialist, testified that she saw the senator inside the restaurant. Thompson said she was working with her partner, Damian Bradland, to surveil an individual from New York who would be in Washington that night. They developed a cover story as a married couple out on a dinner date. \u201cIt looked natural,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBecause Morton\u2019s is a high-end restaurant, we made sure we dressed the part.\u201d Thompson told the court they found the senator and others dining in the restaurant\u2019s patio area, where there were only a few people being served. The investigators got themselves a table \u201ctwo arm\u2019s length away,\u201d she said, from the group they were observing. At the dinner table, Thompson observed the senator pour a bottle of wine, and there were also cigarettes and cigars, she testified. \u201cThey appeared to be getting along just fine,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the laughter and what we heard, it made me think they were getting along.\u201d \u201cWe dined just like them,\u201d Thompson said. Bradland took photos of her with the subjects\u2019 table in the background, using their married couple cover to instead document their surveillance. They took no audio surveillance, however, and she jotted notes down to remember what they heard, although not a direct transcript, she testified. Asked by Fee if they observed anything that suggested the subjects of the surveillance were trying to avoid being photographed or observed, both Mills and Thompson said they did not.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/fbi-bob-menendez-steakhouse-dinner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Asked if he\u2019s ever considered not running again because of his age, Biden, 81, said: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d He repeated his exhortation \u2014 \u201cwatch me\u201d \u2014 when pressed on voters\u2019 age-related concerns. \u201cLook, name me a president that\u2019s gotten as much done as I\u2019ve gotten done in my first three and a half years,\u201d he told the outlet.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_can-trump-still-run-for-president-what-matters", "text": "Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president? Definitely. A further question is more complicated: Could Trump, as a felon, vote for himself? Probably. Starting with the easy question \u2026 Can a convict run for president? The US Constitution lays out just three requirements for presidential candidates. They must: Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That\u2019s not happening any time soon. Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump\u2019s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee. It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said most Class E felony convictions, the least serious type of felony in New York, result in non-prison sentences \u2013 often a combination of probation, fines and community service. As a former president, Trump enjoys lifetime Secret Service protection and he will continue to get protection wherever he is, according to Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service. \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the manner in which the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged,\u201d Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN. There is also precedent for presidential campaigns, albeit unsuccessful ones, being mounted from prison cells. Eugene Debs, the Socialist leader, conducted his 1920 presidential campaign from federal prison in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition. He had encouraged Americans to oppose the draft in World War I. The Supreme Court, in that case, had affirmed his conviction, arguing he was convicted not for opposing the draft but for encouraging people not to comply with it. The decision keeping Debs in jail was written by then-Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes just a few months before Holmes did a famous about-face on free speech that put the US on course for the way we view the First Amendment today. Thomas Doherty, an American studies professor at Brandeis University, wrote last year about Debs, noting that he remained in prison as votes were cast and counted \u2013 he got nearly a million, more than 3% of the vote. Even after the Sedition Act was repealed, Debs was kept in prison. Then-President Woodrow Wilson refused to issue a pardon. Wilson\u2019s successor and Debs\u2019 rival in 1920, Warren G. Harding, later commuted Debs\u2019 sentence in 1921. And now to the more difficult question \u2026 Can a convicted felon vote? It depends. Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Each state makes its own rules. Vermont and Maine allow felons to vote from prison. There has been movement in multiple states toward allowing felons on parole to cast ballots. Trump is now a Florida resident \u2013 and Florida voters, in 2018, overwhelmingly backed a referendum to reenfranchise convicted felons. But Republican lawmakers who control the state\u2019s government first delayed and then qualified the reenfranchisement by requiring that felons must pay all fines and fees associated with their sentence. I talked to Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization that works to help reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people. He predicted Trump will have little problem voting since Florida actually defers to the jurisdiction of a felony conviction as to whether a felon can vote. In New York, after a law passed in 2021, any convicted felon who is not incarcerated is eligible to register to vote. Read more from the Campaign Legal Center. Even if the judge ultimately tried to give Trump prison time, it is highly unlikely that Trump\u2019s right to appeal his conviction would be exhausted before Election Day. If, somehow, Trump was convicted in one of the two federal criminal cases against him before Election Day, that might be another story. There are other problems for many post-incarceration felons in Florida, as CNN has reported previously, although they would not apply to Trump. For starters, there is no clearinghouse of data about what fees are required. It has led to confusion and kept many people from voting. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who are confused about their eligibility, and that\u2019s why we continue to work with the state and the election professionals to fix the system,\u201d Volz told me. \u201cBecause people need to know whether they\u2019re eligible or not on the front end of the process.\u201d Volz said his group is making progress with the state to make it much easier for people to confirm their eligibility.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_takeaways-day-1-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "Guns, addiction and politics hung over jury selection at Hunter Biden\u2019s criminal trial Monday, with at-times emotional questioning that resulted in the selection of a diverse 12-member panel. Throughout the day at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, prospective jurors were asked for their thoughts on the politicization of the criminal justice system, the state of US gun laws and their relationships with people struggling with addiction. These topics will weigh heavily in the case against Hunter Biden, who made history Monday by becoming the first child of a sitting US president to go on trial. He pleaded not guilty to unlawfully buying and possessing a firearm while abusing drugs, which is against federal law. Hunter Biden is a recovering alcohol and crack cocaine addict. The final 12-member jury is evenly split between six men and six women. A majority of the panel is Black, according to CNN\u2019s observations. There are also four alternates. Opening statements are set for 9 a.m. ET Tuesday, where prosecutors will spell out their allegations that Hunter Biden was an active drug user when he bought a revolver at a Wilmington gun shop in October 2018. They have contemporaneous texts and testimony from three of his romantic partners who, they say, can back up their case. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys take issue with the case itself \u2013 they claim special counsel David Weiss was motivated by political bias against the president. But Judge Maryellen Noreika blocked them from arguing this to the jury. So, their defense will likely focus on narrower questions about the definition of \u201caddict\u201d and the forms involved in the gun purchase. Here are\u00a0takeaways\u00a0from the first day of Hunter Biden\u2019s long-awaited trial: Pain of addiction takes center stage Throughout the day, prospective jurors opened up about their loved ones who struggled with addiction, in front of a fully packed courtroom with reporters from around the world. Several of those jurors, who all hail from Delaware, made it onto the final jury panel. One woman on the jury said her sister was a \u201crecovering addict\u201d who was previously convicted of drug crimes and credit card fraud and did time in Delaware state prison. Another woman who is on the jury said her best friend from childhood died from a heroin overdose. One man who wasn\u2019t picked for the jury had trouble getting the words out when he talked about his nephew\u2019s multiple stints in and out of rehab. This all ties into the case because prosecutors will need to zero in on Hunter Biden\u2019s long-acknowledged struggles with addiction to win a conviction. They plan to highlight deeply personal and traumatic messages that he exchanged with family, where he fought about his sobriety, and said drugs \u201cruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished.\u201d How the jurors interpret Hunter\u2019s addiction may determine the verdict. Jurors were also pressed on another key aspects of the case: guns The jury pool included a wide range of views on gun rights in the US, with some saying certain firearms \u2013 like so-called assault weapons \u2013 should be banned and others praising the Second Amendment. Several jurors selected said they owned a firearm, one of whom had a concealed carry license and said\u00a0he believed \u201cour Second Amendment right is very important, and I stand with it.\u201d When asked about her views on drugs and gun ownership, a woman selected said people who smoke marijuana should be allowed to own firearms, saying that \u201cweed, to me, isn\u2019t as bad as\u201d other drugs, like heroin. Another juror selected as an alternate said she believed that mental health evaluations should be part of the process to possess a firearm, citing school shootings and saying that gun laws should be \u201cmore strict.\u201d A family affair This is personal for the Bidens. President Biden issued a rare statement about his son\u2019s case. And first lady Jill Biden was in the courtroom throughout the day, sitting in the pews, a few feet from Hunter, as she celebrated her 73rd birthday. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad,\u201d President Biden\u2019s statement said. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\u201d The president was clear to say that \u201cI don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases,\u201d and didn\u2019t say anything about the prosecutors or their motivations in going after his son. As president, if Biden wanted to shut down this case, he could do so today, by issuing a full pardon to Hunter. But the White House has repeatedly and explicitly ruled that out. In the courtroom in Wilmington, the first lady was flanked her daughter Ashley Biden and by Hunter\u2019s current wife Sandi Cohen. Also sitting in the same row was Kevin Morris, the Hollywood lawyer who has bankrolled Hunter Biden\u2019s lofty legal bills over the past several years.

Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19", "text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified on Monday at a House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the origins of the virus. The hearing was Fauci\u2019s first public testimony on Capitol Hill since his retirement from government service. It turned contentious at times as Republicans grilled Fauci over a wide range of topics, including the basis for public health recommendations during the pandemic and email use by public health officials. Here are key takeaways from the hearing: US still needs to close communication gaps to be better prepared for next pandemic Fauci said there are still some things the US needs to work on to be more prepared for another pandemic in the aftermath of Covid-19, saying in \u201csome respects\u201d the country is better prepared to deal with a health crisis than in 2020, \u201cbut in others, I am still disappointed.\u201d One thing that he hopes the US will do better moving forward is tightening communication between the federal response and local public health officials. Fauci said there was a \u201cdisconnect between the health-care system and the public health system\u201d during Covid-19 in the US. Specifically, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not demand information from local agencies, which caused a lag in sharing data. \u201cWe were at a disadvantage,\u201d Fauci said, adding that the CDC is working on ways to fix this pain point. Republicans grill Fauci over public health official\u2019s use of email Fauci testified Monday that he has not used his personal email to conduct business, and he was not aware before a congressional investigation that a former senior adviser at the National Institutes of Health had used unofficial email. \u201cWhat you saw, I believe, with Dr. Morens was an aberrancy and an outlier,\u201d Fauci testified on Monday, referring to a former senior adviser at NIH. \u201cThe individuals at the NIH and NIAID are a very committed group of individuals and this one instance that you point out is an aberrancy and an outlier.\u201d The House Oversight select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic previously released a series of private emails that Republicans argue show that some NIH officials deleted emails and tried to get around requirements to disclose information through public records laws. In a memo published at the end of May, committee members said Dr. David Morens, a former senior adviser to Fauci, engaged in \u201cnefarious behavior.\u201d Fauci said he had worked on research publications with Morens in his role as a senior adviser, but Morens\u2019 role did not include advising Fauci on any department policy. The committee points to email that Morens sent another colleague that suggests he would send email to Fauci\u2019s private account and \u201cthere is no worry about FOIAs.\u201d FOIA is the Freedom of Information Act, the law that gives the public the right to obtain federal records, including emails sent within government agencies. Morens\u2019 email goes on to say that he can also hand information to Fauci to avoid it being a part of the public record. Fauci testifies about possible origins of virus that caused Covid-19 In Fauci\u2019s testimony, he addressed what he said were \u201ccertain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,\u201d particularly around the origin of the virus that led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fauci testified that in early 2020, he was informed through phone calls with two scientists \u2014 Jeremy Farrar, then the director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK and Kristian Andersen, a scientist at Scripps Research \u2014 that they and others were concerned that the virus that causes Covid-19 could have been manipulated in the lab. The day after those calls, Fauci said he participated in a conference call with several international virologists to discuss manipulation in the lab or possible spillover from animals to humans. He characterized the discussion as \u201clively,\u201d with arguments on both sides. Fauci said he did not try to steer the discussion in any direction. Fauci said the virologists on the joint call decided to more carefully examine the genomic sequence and after further examination, and said, \u201cseveral who at first were concerned about lab manipulation became convinced that the virus was not deliberately manipulated.\u201d Scientists found the most likely scenario, Fauci said, was a virus that transferred from an animal to a human, \u201calthough they still kept an open mind.\u201d \u201cThe accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous,\u201d Fauci said, noting he had no input into the content on a paper published in March 2020 that discussed the possible origins of the virus. Some of the world\u2019s leading scientists have investigated the origins of the virus, including a committee of experts from the World Health Organization. Most scientists believe that the virus spread from animals to humans in China. Some studies have also said that the theory that the virus escaped from a Chinese lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, cannot be ruled out. Most US intelligence agencies say the virus was not genetically engineered, but it is still not totally clear how the pandemic started. A US intelligence analysis released last year said either origin was possible, and the community remains split on the issue. The US Department of Energy assessed last year that it had \u201clow confidence\u201d in the lab leak theory. No US federal agency believes that the virus that causes Covid-19 was created as a bioweapon. \u201cI cannot account nor can anyone account for other things that might be going on in China, which is the reason why I have always said and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin is,\u201d Fauci said Monday. Fauci details threats he and his family have received Fauci detailed the threats he received during his time as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describing death threats against him and threats against his wife and daughters. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell asked Fauci to explain what some of the threats were and he replied: \u201cEverything from harassments from emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrest of two individuals \u2013 and credible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me. And it\u2019s required my having protective services essentially all the time.\u201d Fauci said he feared that the threats against public health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic would serve as a \u201cpowerful disincentive\u201d for the best and brightest candidates to take up the profession. \u201cThey say to themselves, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go there. Why should I get involved in that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re reluctant to put themselves and their family through what they see their colleagues being put through,\u201d he testified. The 6-foot social distance guideline came from the CDC, Fauci clarifies Fauci clarified that the 6-foot guidance for social distancing given during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic did not come from him, but from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIt actually came from the CDC. The CDC was responsible for those kinds of guidelines to schools, not me,\u201d Fauci said. Fauci, who repeated the guidance during the pandemic, once said that there was no science behind it \u2014 but he meant that there were no clinical trials to back it up. \u201cIt had little to do with me since I didn\u2019t make the recommendation and my saying \u2018there was no science behind it\u2019 meant there was no clinical trial behind that,\u201d Fauci said. He added that he believed the CDC used studies about droplets years ago as reasoning for the 6-foot guidelines. When the CDC first promoted the idea of 6-foot \u201csocial distancing\u201d for people who had to be around others during the pandemic, scientists thought that larger contaminated droplets would fall out of the air quickly and couldn\u2019t travel farther than 6 feet. At the time, the World Health Organization recommended that people keep a meter, or 3.3 feet, between them. But even as early as 2021, scientists were starting to understand that the coronavirus is airborne, meaning it could spread through droplets\u00a0and aerosols, smaller particles that could travel\u00a0even farther\u00a0and float in the air. That\u2019s in large part why public health agencies emphasized the importance of people wearing masks to reduce the number of germs that could float in the air and make people sick.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Menendez, who is facing federal corruption charges and is on trial in New York City, had announced in March that he would not run for a fourth full term as a Democrat, but left open the possibility of an independent bid if exonerated. He faces a Tuesday deadline to file as an independent. New Jersey\u2019s deadline for independent candidates to withdraw from the ballot is August 16. His presence in the race could make the Senate contest in New Jersey more unpredictable, with control of the chamber hanging in the balance.

It marks a sharp reversal from Trump\u2019s repeated calls to end the practice of mail-in voting altogether and his discouragement of Republicans from voting any other way but at the polls on Election Day. \u201cRepublicans must win and we will use every appropriate tool to beat the Democrats because they are destroying our country.\u00a0Whether you vote absentee, by mail, early in-person or on election day, we are going to protect the vote.\u00a0We make sure your ballot is secure and your voice is heard,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement Tuesday. After being projected the winner of the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump had declared in his victory speech: \u201cWe\u00a0have\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0rid\u00a0of\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballots\u00a0because\u00a0once\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballots,\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0crooked\u00a0elections.\u201d And Trump, after becoming the presumptive nominee, said in an interview with Britain\u2019s GB News in March that \u201cany time the mail is involved, you\u2019re going to have cheating.\u201d But as Republican officials urge the former president to embrace the voting methods ahead of November, Trump has made conflicting statements on the voting practices, oscillating between casting doubt and encouraging them. Trump posted on his social media site Truth Social last month, \u201cABSENTEE VOTING, EARLY VOTING, AND ELECTION DAY VOTING ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS. REPUBLICANS MUST MAKE A PLAN, REGISTER, AND VOTE!\u201d The Trump-backed chairman of the RNC, Michael\u00a0Whatley,\u00a0has said encouraging Republican voters to vote early and by mail are \u201ctop priorities\u201d this election cycle.\u00a0Lara Trump, the co-chair of the RNC and Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, has also publicly advocated for the GOP to embrace the practices. The new program builds on the RNC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cBank Your Vote\u201d campaign that was launched last year. The video announcing the initiative at the time included comments from Trump in support of it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/trump-mail-in-early-voting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}

But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_joe-manchin-independent-not-running", "text": "West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said Monday he\u2019s \u201cnot running for any office\u201d after registering as an independent over the Memorial Day recess, but he didn\u2019t completely rule out the possibility. \u201cI\u2019m not running for any office, political office. I\u2019ve been very clear about that,\u201d the senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, insisting that his decision to become an independent had nothing to do with running for Senate or governor ahead of the\u00a0August 1\u00a0filing deadline. But pressed on whether he was closing the door on a future run, he added, \u201cI have not \u2013 I never leave any, you never leave any political opportunity and walk away from that, so you always have options, because life is full of surprises. But I have no intention of running for political office.\u201d Manchin, whose announcement last year that he wasn\u2019t seeking reelection was a political gift to Republicans hoping to flip the Senate, noted that he had informed President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of his decision to leave the party before he did so. The retiring senator said that he decided to become an independent now so he could \u201chave time under [his] belt\u201d with the label before he leaves the Senate, noting that having the letter \u201cD\u201d by his name had become \u201ctoxic\u201d in his home state, which President Donald Trump carried by nearly 40 points in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go back home with the brands being so toxic as they are. My state\u2019s flipped so much as it has, even having a D brand \u2014 knowing that Joe is just Joe Manchin from West Virginia, they don\u2019t look at me as a Democrat or a Republican \u2014 but on that, by having a D brand, they still label you and it makes it a little bit more challenging to get through,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking and planning this for a long time. I thought the time was right, now as I\u2019m going to transition into private life, I wanted to make sure I could be an honest broker. And say \u2018Oh, he just did it because you\u2019re moving into something else.\u2019 No, I did it while I\u2019m still a senator.\u201d Manchin said it would be easier for him to focus on his post-Senate goals as an independent, like empowering the middle of the political spectrum. \u201cLet\u2019s open up some of these primaries in these states, let people have better candidates to choose from. We\u2019re getting kind of a controlled movement to where the primaries are controlled to the point that when you get to the general election, you\u2019re choices aren\u2019t what you might want, whether they be on the national level from president all the way down,\u201d he argued. Manchin, who still plans to caucus with Democrats in the Senate, said his colleagues were only \u201csurprised it took this long,\u201d and that the president \u201cunderstood\u201d why he was making this choice. \u201cI explained the dynamics of my state and the people I represent do not connect today with the Democratic Party and especially the policies of the National Democrat Party,\u201d he said. The senator said he\u2019s still not prepared to say if he\u2019ll support Biden in November and that he\u2019s hoping he can push the president more toward the political center. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten involved in the presidential election to this point. There will be a time, there\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I want to see, I want to see the Joe Biden I\u2019ve known for 37 years come back to where the Joe Biden had started from: always in the center, center-left, maybe, but always in the center to make a deal. I think he\u2019s been pulled too far by his staff to the far left. And I\u2019m hoping and praying I can push him back.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/joe-manchin-independent-not-running/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_takeaways-day-2-hunter-biden-federal-gun-trial", "text": "The second day of Hunter Biden\u2019s trial laid the groundwork for both sides of the case, as prosecutors and defense attorneys battled over the fundamental issue at play: whether Biden purchased a gun while addicted to drugs. In opening statements Tuesday, prosecutor Derek Hines made clear that President Joe Biden\u2019s son \u201cisn\u2019t charged with possessing drugs,\u201d but rather because he allegedly lied on a federal background check form. \u201cAddiction may not be a choice,\u201d Hines said, but it is a choice to illegally buy a gun. Hines continued: \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the defendant\u2019s lies and choices. \u2026 No one is above the law. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what your name is.\u201d Melissa Cohen Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s wife, vigorously shook her head in disapproval when Hines argued that Biden knew he was an addict when he bought the gun. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell repeatedly highlighted during his opening statement that prosecutors needed \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law.\u201d Lowell emphasized that Biden\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d when he purchased the gun was instrumental in the case. He also tried to humanize his client, saying that he abused alcohol and drugs \u201clike literally millions of people in this country\u201d and was plagued by various \u201ctraumas,\u201d including the 1972 car crash in Wilmington that killed his mother and gave him a brain injury when he was a child. At one point while Lowell was speaking, one juror appeared to become emotional, reaching for tissues in her bag and dabbed her eyes and her nose several times. Lowell, well into his statement, had explained how despite claims from prosecutors, the evidence doesn\u2019t show Biden was using drugs the day he bought the gun. Lowell was also discussing the tumultuous days when Hallie Biden found the gun and threw it in a trash can outside a supermarket. Here\u2019s what to know from Tuesday in court: Biden speaks \u2013 through his audiobook The first hour of witness testimony was consumed by prosecutors playing several long passages of the audiobook Biden narrated for his 2021 memoir, \u201cBeautiful Things.\u201d It droned on at times, but was also filled with gripping first-person storytelling about the depths of his addiction, spurring some jurors to listen closely and take notes. Many of those jurors said during the selection process Monday that they lost loved ones to drug overdoses and alcoholism, so Biden\u2019s personal struggles could strike a chord. In the excerpts played aloud in court Tuesday, chosen by the special counsel\u2019s office, Biden described intense \u201cfeelings of shame and guilt\u201d while crack plunged him into the \u201cdarkest recesses of your soul.\u201d He said he had a \u201climitless appetite for debasement\u201d that led to near-death experiences while he drove high in Arizona and bought drugs from homeless people in Los Angeles. Prosecutors highlighted a part of the book where Biden said he had \u201cfour years of active addiction\u201d from 2015 to 2019, which, importantly, would cover the time period when he bought a gun in October 2018. It\u2019s against the law for a drug user or addict to buy or possess a gun \u2013 which is the basis of the three felonies Biden is facing. First lady Jill Biden sat stoically while she listened to the recordings of her son airing out the worst moments of his life. She looked straight ahead at the FBI special agent on the witness stand, whom prosecutors used to introduce evidence from the memoir. Under cross-examination by Biden\u2019s lawyer, the FBI agent, Erika Jensen, conceded that Biden might not have been abusing drugs during the entire five-year period. Defense strategy Lowell laid out his version of the case and strategy moving forward in the morning opening statements and during cross-examination of the FBI agent in the afternoon. Not only did Lowell say that prosecutors must prove Biden knowingly violated the law when he bought the gun, but the attorney also argued that many of the text messages prosecutors had cited about the attempts to get drugs were months apart from when he purchased the firearm. During cross examination, Lowell noted that scores of the messages and pictures introduced to the jury through the FBI agent were in early 2019, months after Biden purchased the gun in October 2018. He also pointed out several discrepancies between Biden\u2019s memoir and text messages and travel logs presented by the FBI agent, indicating that not everything in the book \u2013 which is heavily cited by the government in its case \u2013 was completely factually accurate. Lowell said during his opening that text messages sent around the time Biden bought the weapon \u2013 including one where Biden said he was smoking crack \u2013 were actually about him trying to avoid Hallie Biden, who he was with at the time, and not doing drugs. In court, there were a few moments when Biden turned to his mom, his wife and his sister Ashley in the front row behind him. He mouthed words to his wife, who smiled. Jury sees lurid texts and photos Prosecutors also introduced a tranche of evidence that investigators obtained from Biden\u2019s electronics, including his infamous laptop. Their goal is to illustrate Biden abused drugs in 2018. They tried to accomplish this by playing a shirtless video of him holding what looked like a crack pipe, reading texts where he haphazardly tried to meet drug dealers in California and Massachusetts and showing his angry exchanges with his loved ones about his many personal failures. One exchange showed a drug dealer in Los Angeles trying to cut ties with Biden, complaining that he was going \u201cout of my way\u201d to get him drugs, at the cost of spending time with his own family. The dealer ended the text with, \u201cWe will always be friends, bro.\u201d In other messages, Biden said he was \u201csleeping on a car smoking crack\u201d at a street corner in downtown Wilmington that\u2019s only a few blocks away from the federal courthouse where the trial is under way. His defense attorneys claimed that he might not have really been doing drugs but rather was trying to avoid his ex-partner, Hallie Biden. Biden\u2019s laptop has been at the center of a yearslong political saga, with his team claiming it may have contained fake emails concocted by Russia, while many Republicans heralded it as ironclad proof that he and his father got rich from corrupt overseas deals. Prosecutors used the laptop much more narrowly, to try and prove that Biden used drugs in 2018. It was still a major moment when prosecutors unveiled the physical laptop for all in the courtroom to see. The silver MacBook has been bandied about in right-wing media for years, and the public saw it for the very first time on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s ex-wife likely to testify next Lowell will continue to cross-examine Jensen, who will then go through one last round of questions from prosecutors. During their opening arguments, prosecutors read the witnesses they expect to call during the trial in order, signaling that they would call Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, to the stand second. In filings, prosecutors say that Biden\u2019s ex-wife will testify about finding drugs or paraphernalia on multiple occasions in his car.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_felon-trump-rights-what-matters", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s conviction by a New York jury on 34 felony counts is historic and unprecedented. No former president or major party presidential candidate has also been a felon. When CNN asked readers for their questions, a flood came in. Some of the more interesting and most-asked questions are below. And if there\u2019s something we didn\u2019t get to, ask us here. It varies by state. In New York, where Trump was convicted, there are \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of being convicted of a felony. Importantly, felons in New York cannot hold many public offices, including elected positions. But Trump is no longer a New York resident. In Florida, felons lose civil rights, including the ability to hold public office and serve on a jury. While he can\u2019t hold office in Florida or New York, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution to bar him from running for president. In New York, a felon can apply for a Certificate of Good Conduct to restore all rights after a certain period of time. The charges against Trump are Class E felonies, for which the period is three years. Florida requires felons to apply for clemency through a special board, but in the case of out-of-state convictions like Trump\u2019s, it defers to the state where the person was convicted. Not in this case. Presidents have the power to issue pardons for federal offenses. Trump has been convicted of a felony in New York state court. That would require the pardon of New York\u2019s governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, who has praised his conviction. Most likely. Trump is a Florida resident, and Florida defers to New York law on the question of felons voting. New York allows felons to vote as long as they are not incarcerated. His sentencing is set for July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Judge Juan Merchan could technically impose prison time \u2013 felony falsifying business records can be punished with up to four years in prison. But Trump has been convicted of Class E felonies, the lowest level in New York law. He is also a first-time offender. That said, Merchan could take into account that Trump has repeatedly violated a gag order. Here\u2019s what Secret Service chief of communications Anthony Guglielmi told CNN after the jury reached the guilty verdict: \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the\u00a0manner in which\u00a0the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged.\u201d No one knows exactly. Time in prison still seems relatively unlikely for this offense. One can imagine the US Supreme Court getting involved or the sentence being delayed until after his term, or even a pardon by the New York governor in the interest of the country. But these are all just possibilities. Yes. A survey of past cases by the legal website Just Security  found numerous examples of prison time being imposed for this offense. These types of convictions do not usually lead to jail time. Trump\u2019s conviction does not automatically prevent him from holding a US passport. But it could make it difficult to travel to some countries. Thirty-eight countries don\u2019t allow felons to enter their borders, according to World Population Review, which says that some of those countries deny entry to felons \u201cup front\u201d while others do so only after such a conviction is \u201cdiscovered.\u201d That list includes Canada and Mexico, as well as Australia, China and South Africa. Federal law bars individuals convicted of a felony from possessing a firearm, and most states have analogous prohibitions. A case challenging the federal prohibition has been appealed to the US Supreme Court, but the justices have not yet said whether they will hear the challenge. In New York, convicted felons cannot obtain a permit to possess a firearm. It\u2019s possible for Trump to later petition a state judge to have his firearm possession rights restored. In Florida, where Trump is a resident, the Sunshine State has a similar felon disarmament law on the books. That law bars people convicted of a felony in Florida courts from possessing a firearm and also extends that prohibition to individuals found guilty of a felony in another state. But under Florida law, the state\u2019s Clemency Board \u201cwill not consider requests for firearm authority from individuals convicted in federal or out-of-state courts,\u201d according to the state. Technically. But not likely. The Supreme Court ruled this year that Congress could keep Trump off ballots if it passed a special measure determining he took part in an insurrection. That\u2019s not at issue in this New York case, and it\u2019s not going to happen when Republicans control the House as they currently do. The Constitution also allows for people who are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate to be barred from federal office. Trump was impeached twice as president but acquitted twice in the Senate. Yes. Appeals and the sentencing process are ongoing, so the gag order remains in effect. That means every time Trump criticizes a key witness like Michael Cohen, he dances up to the line of violating the gag order, which could lead to penalties like fines or even jail time. The trial has been delayed by allegations of impropriety against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for her relationship with a former prosecutor on the case. As a result, a trial date has not been set. Trump\u2019s two federal trials are also on ice. The judge in Florida overseeing the case in which federal prosecutors allege he mishandled classified documents and tried to hide them from the National Archives has proceeded very slowly and has allowed procedural questions to pile up. The trial is currently postponed indefinitely. In the federal election subversion case in Washington, DC, the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on whether Trump should enjoy immunity from prosecution as a former president. The hush money payoff took place just before the 2016 election. The fact of the payments was discovered in 2018. Federal prosecutors ultimately decided not to pursue charges against Trump related to the payments and so did a previous Manhattan DA, Cy Vance Jr. It was seen as a gamble when current Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg ultimately announced charges in April 2023. It would be difficult for anyone with a felony conviction to get security clearance. But presidents do not need to obtain security clearance. The voters have essentially given them access to all the country\u2019s secrets. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor in New York unless the crime is committed with intent to commit another crime. In this case, the other crimes were federal campaign violations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/felon-trump-rights-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_hunter-biden-exes-addiction-gun-trial", "text": "Special counsel David Weiss plans to present extremely personal testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s drug addiction from three of his former romantic partners, according to a new filing in the felony gun case against the president\u2019s son. In a filing Monday evening, prosecutors laid out their case against Hunter Biden, which is scheduled to go to trial on June 3 in Delaware. Prosecutors described some of their key witnesses\u00a0and\u00a0what they plan to say on the stand, and they also released text messages and photos that they plan to show to the jury. The president\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to three crimes\u00a0in the gun case, all stemming from Weiss\u2019 claim that he was abusing drugs while he purchased and briefly possessed a revolver in 2018, which is against federal law. These revelations about Weiss\u2019 trial strategy and witness list underscore the extremely personal nature of this case, which will shine a national spotlight on what Hunter Biden has said was his rock bottom. Hunter Biden has been very open about\u00a0his\u00a0lifelong struggle\u00a0with alcohol and drug addiction. But to win a conviction, Weiss will need to bring that addiction to life for the jury, with compelling witnesses and photographic evidence, to prove in court that Hunter Biden was abusing drugs when he owned the gun. The expected prosecution witnesses include Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and\u00a0his late brother\u2019s widow, whom he later also dated,\u00a0Hallie Biden. The filings don\u2019t identify the women by name, but Weiss\u2019 description of their testimony matches other public details and court filings from related cases. Prosecutors say one witness,\u00a0who CNN has identified as Hallie Biden, will testify that Hunter Biden possessed the revolver in 2018 and that she took it from his car and threw it in a dumpster near a grocery store in Wilmington, Delaware. She would search \u201chis bags, backpacks, and vehicle in an effort to help him get sober, and discovered drug paraphernalia and drugs in his possessions on multiple occasions\u201d in 2018, prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors said in the filing that a third expected witness will testify that she \u201cobserved the defendant using crack cocaine frequently \u2014 every 20 minutes except when he slept.\u201d The filing from prosecutors also includes scores of text messages they say are from Hunter Biden, including images of drugs,\u00a0as well as\u00a0messages about sobriety and meeting with drug dealers. \u201cThe government intends to show videos and photographs of the defendant smoking crack, or of crack or drug paraphernalia in videos/photographs backed up to the defendant\u2019s Apple iCloud account or laptop, or sent in the defendant\u2019s messages,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Other witnesses prosecutors will call include federal agents and\u00a0the gun store\u00a0employee\u00a0who allegedly sold Hunter Biden the pistol in 2018. One Drug Enforcement Administration agent, prosecutors say, will discuss coded terms and drug language they say Hunter Biden used in text messages with others, \u201csuch as \u2018baby powder,\u2019 \u2018Party Favor,\u2019 \u201810grams,\u2019 (and) \u2018chore boy.\u2019\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/hunter-biden-exes-addiction-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_hunter-biden-trial-preview", "text": "Hunter Biden is set to stand trial Monday on felony gun charges in a historic case that could impact President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. This is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes. Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. The trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware. What are the charges? The first two charges in the\u00a0three-count indictment\u00a0are tied to the gun purchase itself. When a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms. These questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly\u00a0checked the box\u00a0that said, \u201cNo.\u201d Count 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It\u2019s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings. \u201cGuns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that\u2019s the impetus behind these laws,\u201d Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \u201cThe evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter \u2026 but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\u201d Who are the witnesses? Prosecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case. Most notably, they\u2019ve\u00a0lined up testimony\u00a0from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife,\u00a0Kathleen Buhle and his late brother\u2019s widow,\u00a0Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated. Their testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019. \u201cHe\u2019s going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\u201d said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \u201cIt depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It\u2019s a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers\u00a0wanted to\u00a0call an expert who\u00a0could\u00a0tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles.\u00a0But in a ruling Sunday, the judge blocked the defense attorneys from using that witness because of procedural defects with their disclosures to prosecutors about what the expert might say. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023. Who are the prosecutors? The case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland\u00a0elevated\u00a0Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden\u00a0blew up\u00a0in spectacular fashion. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss\u00a0panned\u00a0this theory as a \u201cfiction designed for a Hollywood script,\u201d and the judge overseeing the gun case\u00a0concluded the allegations were \u201cnonsensical under the facts here.\u201d But many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d last year that would have\u00a0resolved\u00a0the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts\u00a0told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.) Who is the judge? District Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware\u2019s two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate\u00a0confirmed her nomination\u00a0with a unanimous voice vote in 2018. She oversaw last summer\u2019s dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That\u2019s when Garland named Weiss as special counsel. Noreika\u2019s no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key\u00a0evidentiary questions. Could Hunter Biden go to prison? If convicted on all three counts, the president\u2019s son could face up to 25 years in prison. However, he doesn\u2019t have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika. These are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment. The White House has\u00a0explicitly ruled out\u00a0the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election. Has this ever happened before? This is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial. Over the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush\u2019s son\u00a0faced civil penalties\u00a0for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. \u00a0Jimmy Carter\u2019s\u00a0brother\u00a0was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial. CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \u201cthere\u2019s always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\u201d but that Hunter Biden\u2019s sprawling legal issues \u201ccut unusually close to the bone because it\u2019s the president\u2019s son.\u201d \u201cThis trial is an albatross around President Biden\u2019s neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cFor any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it\u2019s harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\u201d The family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son. There is a\u00a0separate court battle\u00a0over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden\u2019s team argued in his case \u2013\u00a0unsuccessfully\u00a0\u2013 that the law violates the Second Amendment. The jury pool Approximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They\u2019ll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates. Delaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large. As part of the selection process \u2013 called voir dire \u2013 prospective jurors\u00a0will be asked\u00a0whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They\u2019ll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they\u2019ve been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971. Other questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \u201cDo you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\u201d or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \u201cis not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\u201d What has Hunter Biden said? Since his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn\u2019t said much about his legal cases. He\u00a0spoke out in December\u00a0amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \u201cmade mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\u201d But he slammed the \u201cMAGA right\u201d lawmakers who \u201cridiculed my struggle with addiction\u201d and \u201cbelittled my recovery.\u201d \u201cThey have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\u201d he said. Previously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his\u00a02021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \u201chad no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\u201d The laptop, texts and emails One of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \u201cis real\u201d and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president\u2019s son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation. Republican officials\u00a0and\u00a0right-wing outlets\u00a0have seized on the laptop\u2019s embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files\u00a0were manipulated and\u00a0sued a repair-shop owner\u00a0who helped make the materials public. Many on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn\u2019t verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently\u00a0took a victory lap\u00a0on its front cover. In a ruling last month, Noreika said she\u2019ll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse. \u201cI\u2019m a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I\u2019m delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I\u2019ve ruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished,\u201d he texted Hallie Biden in\u00a0November\u00a02018, according to Weiss\u2019 filings. Prosecutors plan to use the laptop to\u00a0specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss\u00a0has not addressed \u2013 and the case is not about \u2013 Republicans\u2019\u00a0unproven allegation\u00a0that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals. What about the tax charges? This is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year. The second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0troubled finances. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time. Originally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who\u00a0agreed to postpone\u00a0that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness. It has also been updated to correct when Hunter Biden sent Hallie Biden a 2018 text.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_border-biden-trump-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is pulling from former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration playbook as he tries to stop a flow of asylum-seekers from around the world who are crossing into the US at the border with Mexico. Unveiled at the White House on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s new plan to all but shut down the US border to asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally uses executive authority Trump once used to bar people from mostly-Muslim countries from entering the US in 2017 and also to bar most asylum-seekers in 2018 \u2013 days after Republicans suffered huge setbacks in midterm elections that year. It\u2019s an odd, election-year twist, since Biden actually ran his 2020 campaign in part on a promise to revoke those actions, which he did in the months after taking office. Trump\u2019s asylum policy was also blocked by federal courts before Biden revoked it. In addition to slowing the flow of asylum-seekers, Biden\u2019s action could have the political effect of chipping away at Trump\u2019s lead on the immigration issue and triangulating some middle-ground support, even if it leaves progressives angry. Read the full story on Biden\u2019s announcement from CNN\u2019s White House team. Trump and Biden remain very far apart It\u2019s still very true that their rhetoric on immigrants remains very different. Biden expresses openness to immigrants as an important segment of American society. He wants to protect the children of undocumented immigrants who have grown up in the US and to create a pathway to citizenship for those already here. Trump routinely employs over-the-top rhetoric to demonize migrants and asylum-seekers as being from a criminal class or part of a coordinated invasion of the US, although there\u2019s no evidence to support those claims. Trump has promised a militaristic approach to the border and a massive deportation program if he\u2019s elected in November. Biden, meanwhile, has been pivoting to the middle on immigration all year. The decision to invoke executive authority comes months after a bipartisan border proposal in Congress failed to yield a new permanent law to reform the asylum process. Republican lawmakers, bowing to Trump, refused to work with the White House. Trump had said he wanted to run on the issue of immigration in this election year. Announcing the new action at the White House, Biden said he was trying \u201cto do what the Republicans in Congress refused to do.\u201d Even if he\u2019s adopting the authority behind Trump\u2019s policy, he promised not to adopt Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country,\u201d Biden said at the White House. Biden argued that exceptions in his action make it more humane than Trump\u2019s proposals. Asylum-seekers can still try to make an appointment with border officials and seek asylum at a port of entry. Expect challenges The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged Trump\u2019s border actions when he was president, now plans to challenge Biden. \u201cIt was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,\u201d Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement. But today\u2019s Supreme Court, which has a majority of conservative appointees, could be more friendly to Biden\u2019s action. Border crossings are actually down CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores reported from Hidalgo, Texas, on Tuesday and noted the decline in crossings. Whereas last December, there were around 250,000 border apprehensions, figures in recent months are less than 140,000, and Flores reported the figures dropped even further in May. The Biden plan would bar migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met, with some exemptions. The measure would stay in place until encounters drop below an average of 1,500 per day. Officials in Hidalgo County told Flores that any measures to address the influx of asylum-seekers would need to take into account the cross-border traffic that generates economic activity in the area. A top official in Hidalgo County, Judge Richard Cortez, told Flores that Biden\u2019s action, while welcome, was a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d and not a permanent solution. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform remains the sole solution and Congress remains the sole venue to achieve this reform,\u201d Cortez said in a statement to Flores. Flores described her interviews with women who became victims of sexual violence while waiting on the Mexico side of the border for asylum claims to be processed and pointed to the vulnerable position today\u2019s action could force migrants into if they wait on the Mexico side of the border. Why now? CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, reporting from the White House, said part of the administration\u2019s calculus had been to wait until after Mexico\u2019s presidential election, which took place over the weekend, to announce this new action. Americans\u2019 ability to cut border crossings will rest, she said, in part on Mexico\u2019s ability to stop the flow of asylum-seekers within its borders. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our Mexican neighbors instead of attacking Mexico,\u201d Biden said at the White House, drawing a distinction between his approach and Trump\u2019s. Biden said he spoke with Mexico\u2019s president-elect on Monday. Trump holds an advantage on immigration CNN\u2019s Harry Enten notes that in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration has taken on increasing importance in the minds of voters. Troubling for Biden is that Trump is favored by 27 percentage points on the issue, according to polling from CNBC. Watch more from Enten: Long-standing authority Presidents have been using the authority to act on the border for decades; it is based in a 1950s immigration law. Here\u2019s the specific language: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The authority has routinely been used, according to the Congressional Research Service, by all recent presidents to restrict entry to the US for specific groups of people, like Europeans at one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, suspected terrorists or officials from countries like Iran. A fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security outlines the specific changes in how noncitizens will be processed at the border. People apprehended and slated for expedited removal would need to express fear of returning to their home country in order to be interviewed about their situation. Otherwise, they will quickly be returned to either Mexico or their home country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/border-biden-trump-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The possibility that the disqualification fight could stretch to October, as well as an ongoing question about how the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming ruling on presidential immunity could impact the prosecution, makes it\u00a0extremely unlikely Trump will go on trial for election subversion in Georgia before Election Day.

Briefs from defense attorneys in the case are due in 20 days. While the court tentatively set an oral argument day, it is not guaranteed. A party to the case has to request an oral argument and the court then decides whether to grant that request. The panel could also decide to forgo oral arguments and rule on the matter based on filed briefs. A panel of three judges \u2013 Todd Markle, Trenton Brown and Benjamin Land \u2013 is set to consider the case.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_2024-election-legal-entanglement", "text": "The political spotlight of a presidential election entangled in unprecedented legal drama will shift this week from the criminal trial of a former president to one of a sitting president\u2019s son as the campaign enters an intense new phase. Four days after presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump was convicted on 34 counts in his hush money trial in New York, President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter will be called to answer for federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. The trial promises to be a moment of searing personal anguish for the president and comes as he\u2019s seeking to find a political opening after weeks of coverage of Trump\u2019s case. Later this week, the president is expected to issue a sweeping executive action that would dramatically limit migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the southern border. The move, a pivotal moment of Biden\u2019s term and the campaign, will be seen as an effort to blunt Trump\u2019s advantage on an issue that is a foundation of his political career. But it could also risk angering progressive voters who are vital to the president\u2019s hopes of victory in November but have soured on some of his policies, including his support for Israel. Democrats will also seek this week to highlight what they warn are extreme right-wing policies on abortion as the heat of the campaign ratchets up ahead of the first presidential debate, on CNN, at the end of the month. Biden\u2019s effort to seize the initiative in a too-close-to-call campaign will come as the reverberations multiply over the first conviction of a former president and major party nominee. Republicans have mostly closed rank around Trump, claiming that he is a victim of weaponized justice, and the former president\u2019s team and the Republican National Committee are boasting about what they say is a $70 million fundraising spurt following the verdict. Democrats are, meanwhile, debating how to leverage Trump\u2019s conviction, with some calling for a sharper effort to blast Biden\u2019s foe as a convicted felon. It\u2019s too early to tell whether the guilty verdict will have a significant political impact in a nation long polarized by attitudes toward the former president. But a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday showed that Americans believe 57% to 43% that the Manhattan jury reached the right verdict. And in a new ABC/Ipsos poll, Americans said by a roughly 2-to-1 margin that the verdict was right; however, views of Trump were barely changed from before the jury\u2019s decision. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. He had pleaded not guilty and plans to appeal. While the charges in the New York hush money case are considered the least politically damaging of four criminal cases against Trump, the conviction represents an ignominious moment for a twice-impeached former president who had previously enjoyed a lifetime of impunity. The trial will resonate throughout the campaign, since Trump\u2019s sentencing is set for July 11, just four days before the opening of the Republican National Convention, and the former president is vowing to turn November\u2019s election into personal vindication over what he inaccurately claims is political persecution by the Biden administration. Trump compares the US to South American dictatorships The Republican embrace of the party\u2019s presumptive nominee \u2014 despite his conviction by a jury of his own peers \u2014 is a remarkable spectacle as one of the country\u2019s two major parties effectively turns its back on the rule of law. The move suggests that in a possible second term that Trump has vowed to use as \u201cretribution\u201d against his political foes, he would be unconstrained by his party and potentially the law. Trump told Fox News in an interview aired Sunday morning that he was a victim. \u201cIt\u2019s weaponization, and it\u2019s a very dangerous thing. We\u2019ve never had that in this country. They do have it in other countries, in South American countries,\u201d he said. His inflammatory remarks did not reflect the fact that his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss and his demagoguery are far more reflective of developing-world banana republics than a fair jury trial. Lara Trump, the ex-president\u2019s daughter-in-law and the RNC co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Trump had been treated unfairly. \u201cIf his name had been anything other than Donald Trump, this case would have never seen the light of day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system. (People) are very worried about the America that we are facing if this is the precedent we are setting in the United States.\u201d Democrats are rejecting the GOP claim that Trump could never get a fair trial in New York because it\u2019s a liberal city. Some key party figures are also seeking to exploit the guilty verdict politically, even as Biden has stayed largely above the fray after saying the verdict showed no one was above the law. California Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for the Senate, had a simple answer for Trump\u2019s complaints about the jury pool in the city where the former president made his name. \u201cThat jury was selected in part by Donald Trump and his attorneys. They vetted each of the jurors. He had every right that every other criminal defendant has in that courtroom,\u201d Schiff said, also on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThis ordinary jury of peers found him guilty on every single count. So, if you don\u2019t want to be tried in New York, don\u2019t commit crimes in New York.\u201d Biden spotted with son ahead of his trial The start of jury selection in the first-ever trial of a child of a sitting president could blunt claims by the GOP that the Justice Department targets only Republicans at a time when a Democratic senator, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, is also on trial in New York. The indictment of Hunter Biden was brought by Trump-appointed prosecutor David Weiss, who was elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland last year to oversee the probe.\u00a0The president\u2019s only living son is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He has pleaded not guilty to the three charges. The White House has ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but the president has said his son did nothing wrong and that he has turned his life around after struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. Hunter Biden is entitled to the same presumption of innocence and a trial by a jury of his peers that Trump was. In a symbolic show of support, the president was seen with his son on a bike ride near his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home Saturday. While Democrats hope to use Trump\u2019s conviction in their quest to win over independent and moderate voters in the swing states that decide the election, they will also try this week to get more political oxygen for their key campaign themes after the ex-president\u2019s trial dominated headlines since mid-April. As well as Biden\u2019s big immigration announcement, Democrats will seek to train attention on hardline Republican policies on abortion. The Democratic National Committee is, for instance, planning to highlight on Monday a Texas Supreme Court ruling last week that said a medical exemption in the state\u2019s new abortion law applies only when there is a risk of death or serious physical impairment. Democrats say the law is the kind of measure Republicans would seek to implement nationwide if Trump, who built the Supreme Court majority that overturned Roe v. Wade, wins a second term. The ex-president insists, however, abortion policy should be left to the states. Democrats line up abortion attacks In another sign of a widening Democratic offensive on reproductive rights, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York announced he will hold a vote on a \u201cright to contraception\u201d bill Wednesday as Democrats mark two years this month since the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. \u201cDonald Trump and MAGA Republicans will not be able to outrun their anti-abortion records, because the American people know that if given the chance, extremist Republicans will not stop in their campaign to strip away fundamental liberties in this country,\u201d Schumer said in a letter to his Democratic caucus. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday previewed how his party is seeking to simultaneously stress Trump\u2019s conviction and autocratic rhetoric while trying to get attention for its own agenda. The New York Democrat said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a jury had delivered justice in an \u201caffirmation of the American judicial system,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is America. We are not a system that is occupied by a monarch or a king or a dictator. We are a democracy, and in a democracy, no one is above the law.\u201d Jeffries also pivoted to a broader campaign message, arguing that Democrats would lower housing costs and tackle high prices, which are souring many people on the president\u2019s economic agenda. Jeffries said while Republicans were lying for Trump, Democrats would deal with the issues most voters find important. \u201cI\u2019d rather be on President Biden\u2019s side of that contrast than on the extreme MAGA Republican side,\u201d he said. Trump, after complaining bitterly nearly every day that the trial kept him off the campaign trail, is not leaping back into the fray immediately. He is, however, expected to embark on a fundraising swing this week that will include a stop in Beverly Hills, California, on Friday and a rally Sunday in the battleground state of Nevada. In the press release previewing the rally, Trump\u2019s team did not mention his conviction but instead hit an economic message. \u201cWeak Joe Biden and his woke Democrat friends have declared a war on the middle class.\u202fNevadans are suffering under Bidenomics\u202fwith inflation in Nevada,\u201d the release said, also highlighting high gasoline prices. Sen. Tom Cotton, who has drawn buzz as a potential Trump running mate, leaned into the former president\u2019s economic pitch on NBC. \u201cThe real verdict is going to come on Election Day, and it\u2019s going to come from the American people,\u201d the Arkansas Republican said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be based on things like they can\u2019t pay for their rent and put food on the table for their kids; the border is chaos; we\u2019ve got war all around the world.\u201d The emerging economic argument between the two campaigns shows that Trump\u2019s legal quagmire, despite dominating campaign coverage for months and drawing core Republican voters around the ex-president, may not, in the end, be the issue that decides who will serve as president after January.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/2024-election-legal-entanglement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_middle-east-gaza-ceasefire-deal-biden-officials", "text": "Top Biden administration officials are traveling to the Middle East this week to engage in ongoing talks on a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, as well as the dire situation in the Gazan city of Rafah, US officials told CNN. CIA Director Bill Burns, who has served as the administration\u2019s primary interlocutor in ceasefire negotiations, is expected to travel to Doha, according to one US official. Qatar is acting as an intermediary in talks between Israel and Hamas. Middle East Coordinator Brett\u00a0McGurk\u00a0is also headed back to the region this week, a separate official said. Although both regularly travel to the Middle East, their visits come amid a furious diplomatic push by President Joe Biden and his administration to get Hamas and Israel to accept the latest ceasefire proposal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made a flurry of calls since Biden outlined the proposal in a speech last Friday, discussing the ambitious deal with partners and urging them to pressure Hamas to support it. The top US diplomat has spoken twice with the Saudi foreign minister, as well as with his counterparts from Jordan, Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Algeria. He also spoke with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The United States on Monday circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution to support the proposal and calling for it to insist that Hamas accept the deal. Biden on Friday laid out a three-phase proposal that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire,\u201d a plan he said presented the best hope to bring peace to Gaza. The president characterized it as an Israeli proposal. But less than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas. The United States has not seen any response yet from Hamas to the latest ceasefire proposal, a State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any response yet from Hamas, but we do think it is important that the international community and, I think quite importantly, countries in the Arab world have spoken out to call on this deal to be finalized and Hamas to accept it,\u201d State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing. Hamas released a statement last week saying that it viewed the proposal \u201cpositively.\u201d Miller did not know if the proposal itself has reached Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019 leader in Gaza. Miller also said that the Israeli government has communicated to the US that they are ready to implement the ceasefire deal should Hamas accept. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t voices inside Israel, and voices even inside the Israeli government are opposed to it, but the government, speaking on behalf of the government, has said they support this proposal and are ready to stand behind that,\u201d Miller said.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_menendez-new-jersey-primary", "text": "The verdict in Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial is weeks away, but voters on Tuesday will deliver their judgment on the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s political dynasty. Menendez is not on the primary ballot, though he has filed for reelection as an independent. His son, Rep. Rob Menendez Jr., however, is facing a tough challenge from a fellow Democrat as he seeks a second term representing New Jersey\u2019s 8th Congressional District. Menendez Jr. ran all but unopposed for the New Jersey seat in 2022 following the retirement of Democrat Albio Sires, an ally of his father\u2019s. Progressives grumbled over the county Democratic machine\u2019s work to clear the field for Menendez Jr., but he cruised to the nomination and a first term in the House. The indictment of Bob Menendez and Democratic Rep. Andy Kim\u2019s campaign for his Senate seat stoked that progressive frustration again and opened the door for Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla to challenge Menendez Jr. Local politicos now expect a close primary election, with Bhalla, though outspent, well-positioned to capitalize on a growing sense of Menendez fatigue among the electorate. Menendez Jr. has sought to turn the tables on Bhalla by highlighting unrelated corruption allegations against the mayor. Bhalla, a former civil rights attorney, has never been charged. But he is facing a lawsuit from a former city administration member, was censured by the New Jersey Supreme Court for unethical conduct and temporarily lost his license to practice law in New York. Bhalla is counting on a boost from his base in Hoboken and allies in neighboring Jersey City, whose mayor, Steven Fulop, is running for governor in 2025 on a similar, anti-party machine message. The Menendez campaign, while hammering the challenger with voluminous mailers and online attack ads, has walked a fine line to rally support for the incumbent. One prominent street sign urges voters to check the box for \u201cJoe Biden\u201d in the presidential primary and for \u201cRob,\u201d with his last name printed in small text below, in the congressional race. On Monday, the senior Menendez filed to run in for his Senate seat on an independent ballot line in the fall. While he had announced in March that he would not seek reelection in the Democratic primary, he had left the door open to running as an independent if exonerated at his trial. The senator had until Tuesday to file as an independent, though he can withdraw from the ballot by August 16. Menendez\u2019s decision met with immediate backlash from Democrats worried that he could play the spoiler in a general election with Kim and the GOP nominee and also further complicate Menendez Jr.\u2019s efforts to keep his father\u2019s drama in the background. Kim, the heavy front-runner for the Democratic Senate nomination, slammed the senator\u2019s move Monday. \u201cAmericans are fed up with politicians putting their own personal benefit ahead of what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d the South Jersey congressman said in a statement. \u201cEveryone knows Bob Menendez isn\u2019t running for the people of New Jersey, he\u2019s doing it for himself.\u201d Kim and Bhalla made common cause earlier in the primary when they faced similar obstacles \u2013 confronting machine-backed candidates who would benefit from a favorable ballot design. New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy launched her bid for Senate in November and quickly racked up early endorsements from state party leaders. But after Murphy dropped out and a court ordered revisions to the ballot, Kim has mostly kept his distance from other, internally divisive races. As his son stumped through the final hours of the primary campaign, Bob Menendez\u2019s defense lawyers in a federal courtroom on the other side of the Hudson River cross-examined a former top US Department of Agriculture official who has accused the senator of trying to pressure him to back off scrutiny of an ally\u2019s New Jersey-based food industry monopoly. Menendez\u2019s team has argued that, rather than pressing the USDA for any inappropriate or corrupt reason, the senator was simply advocating on a constituent\u2019s behalf. In fact, the defense in their opening statements acknowledged that their client\u2019s behavior could be seen as unsavory or corrupt but that Menendez\u2019s advocacy was not illegal. That line of defense, while perhaps effective in court, paints a damning political picture on the trail. Bhalla, in a video announcing his challenge to Menendez Jr. last year, said, \u201cI believe that America is better than the demagogues who seek to divide us or the politicians who strive only to serve themselves.\u201d The message did not directly mention the congressman\u2019s father, but the implication was clear. The candidates have been less coy as the race heated up. Menendez Jr. hammered Bhalla over an alleged quid pro quo deal around the opening of a marijuana dispensary in Hoboken, frequently demanding that the mayor \u201cstop hiding, stop lying, and immediately be transparent with the public\u201d about the approval process around the contract. Bhalla\u2019s campaign has continued to tie the congressman to his father. \u201cRob Menendez Jr. has yet to commit to endorse Andy Kim for US Senate or even to commit to endorse the Democratic nominee because his father is\u00a0mounting an Independent bid for the same seat. With the US Senate in the balance, his father\u2019s bid could put NJ in play,\u201d Bhalla campaign spokesman Rob Horowitz said in a statement. Bhalla got a late-but-welcome boost last week, with an endorsement from The Jersey Journal editorial board. \u201cAs a freshman in the minority party on the Hill, Menendez has undoubtedly done as well as he could, but voters have an opportunity now to correct the wrong that was done to them two years ago,\u201d the editorial board wrote. To prevail Tuesday, Bhalla, who endorsed Menendez Jr.\u2019s bid in 2022, must also see off another opponent. Businessman Kyle Jasey is on the Democratic ballot too and could draw anti-Menendez support from voters either unfamiliar or distrustful of the Hoboken mayor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/menendez-new-jersey-primary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_fact-check-trump-post-conviction-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he was going to hold a \u201cpress conference\u201d on Friday in the wake of his Thursday conviction in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records. Instead, Trump delivered a rambling monologue that was filled with false claims on subjects ranging from the Manhattan trial to immigration to tax policy. Here is a fact check of some of the inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims he made. Crime in New York City Trump repeated his familiar claim that, while Manhattan prosecutors have been focusing on him, New York City has been experiencing record-high violent crime. He said this time that \u201cyou have violent crime all over this city at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to true. Violent crime in New York City \u2013 and violent crime in Manhattan in particular \u2013 has plummeted since the early 1990s and is today nowhere near record levels. New York City recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990. Michael Cohen\u2019s crimes Criticizing key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump repeated a claim he made during the trial in April. He asserted that Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, \u201cgot into trouble not because of me\u201d but because of \u201coutside deals\u201d and \u201csomething to do with taxicabs and medallions, and he borrowed money, and that\u2019s why he went.\u201d He added that Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations to try to get himself a lighter penalty. Trump continued: \u201cHe got in trouble for a very simple reason: because he was involved with borrowing a lot of money and he did something with the banks \u2013 I don\u2019t know, defrauded the banks, but something happened.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Cohen got into trouble simply because of his non-Trump-related activities, such as those related to taxis and loans, is not true. First, Cohen\u2019s case was referred to federal prosecutors in New York by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate any connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Second, Cohen\u2019s three-year prison sentence in 2018 was for\u00a0multiple\u00a0crimes, some of which were directly related to Trump.\u00a0 Most notably, Cohen was sentenced for\u00a0campaign finance offenses\u00a0connected to a hush money scheme\u00a0during the 2016 presidential campaign to conceal Trump\u2019s alleged extramarital relationships \u2013 the same hush money scheme that was central to this prosecution against Trump. Cohen was\u00a0also sentenced to two months in prison, to run concurrently with the three-year sentence, for\u00a0lying to Congress in 2017 in relation to previous talks about the possibility of building a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia, including about the\u00a0extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the aborted Moscow initiative\u00a0and about when in 2016 the discussions ended.\u00a0(The discussions continued into June 2016, the month after Trump\u00a0became the presumptive Republican nominee, and did not conclude in January 2016 before the first votes were cast, as Cohen had claimed.) Referring to Trump as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d Cohen\u00a0said\u00a0at the time of his 2018 guilty plea for making false statements to the US\u00a0Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: \u201cI made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual-1.\u201d When Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to the campaign finance violations, he\u00a0said\u00a0he broke the law \u201cin coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\u201d\u00a0Trump. Biden and the case Trump repeated his frequent claim that the Manhattan case in which Trump was convicted \u201cis all done by Biden and his people\u201d and \u201cin total conjunction with white house and the DOJ,\u201d the federal Department of Justice. Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that President Joe Biden, his White House aides or the federal Justice Department had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and Bragg, a Democrat, is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration. The judge and an expert in election law Trump claimed that, because of Judge Juan Merchan, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances.\u201d He claimed that this expert on election law was ready to testify \u201cand the judge knocked him out, said you can\u2019t testify.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Merchan refused to allow Trump\u2019s team to use this witness \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d is false. Merchan did not prohibit the potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. Merchan\u00a0decided\u00a0in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan\u00a0refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump, offering a hint of a clarification, did proceed to say on Friday that Smith \u201cessentially\u201d was not able to testify. But his earlier comments made it sound like Merchan had imposed a total ban on Smith\u2019s testimony. Immigration and \u2018the Congo\u2019 Trump repeated a claim he has made before about \u201cthe Congo\u201d and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo. He said: \u201cThe Congo has just released a lot of people from jail \u2013 Congo, Africa \u2013 just released a lot of people, a lot of people, from their prisons and jails, and brought them into the United States of America.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN they have not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having \u201cbrought\u201d ex-prisoners into the US. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. And federal figures show that there is no \u201cvery big\u201d influx of Congolese migrants of any kind, let alone former prisoners in particular. \u201cEverything he is saying isn\u2019t true,\u201d Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trump\u2019s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, \u201cNever ever, it\u2019s not true.\u201d And, he said, \u201cwe want him to stop\u201d telling these stories, since \u201cit\u2019s very bad for the country.\u201d Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo\u2019s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March:\u00a0\u201cThere is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.\u201d You can read more\u00a0here. Trump and Nord Stream 2 Trump repeated his claim that he had ended a key Russian project \u2013 the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. He said: \u201cYou know, I ended the Russian pipeline. It was dead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. He did not \u201cend\u201d Nord Stream nor render it \u201cdead.\u201d While he did\u00a0approve sanctions\u00a0on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already\u00a0around 90% complete\u00a0\u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project\u00a0said\u00a0shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany\u00a0announced\u00a0that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up\u00a0halting the project\u00a0as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been\u00a0described as a likely act of sabotage. Biden\u2019s tax policy Trump claimed while denouncing the Biden administration: \u201cThey want to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. Biden has not proposed to quadruple Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN on Friday that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_wisconsin-2020-fake-electors-scheme", "text": "The Wisconsin attorney general on Tuesday filed charges against three allies of Donald Trump accused of taking part in the effort to put forth a slate of fake electors and usurp the 2020 presidential election, according to online court records. The men \u2013 Kenneth Chesebro, a right-wing attorney who helped devise the fake elector plot; Jim Troupis, a former Trump lawyer; and Michael Roman, a former Trump campaign official \u2013 are each facing a single forgery charge. Wisconsin is the latest state to bring charges against people connected to the former president involved in the broad effort to overturn the presidential election results. State prosecutors in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia also have brought charges against a swath of Trump\u2019s allies. An attorney for Chesebro declined to comment. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Troupis and Roman. Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issued a one word response to the charges Tuesday: \u201cGood.\u201d CNN previously reported that Chesebro was helping investigators in at least four states, including Wisconsin, who were looking into the\u00a0fake electors scheme. Chesebro\u2019s lawyers had believed that his cooperation would be enough for him to stave off charges. The criminal complaint, however, suggests that Chesebro made false statements to investigators about his use of social media, which may have played a role in prosecutors bringing charges against him despite his earlier cooperation. The charging document specifically points to an investigation by CNN\u2019s KFile revealing Chesebro\u2019s secret Twitter account. Last year, the 10 fake electors from Wisconsin disavowed their attempt to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020, recognized the legitimacy of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory, and pledged\u00a0not to serve as real electors in 2024 or any election when Trump is on the ballot \u2013 or to act as sham electors in any future election, as part of a civil lawsuit settlement. The 10 fake electors issued a statement acknowledging that the phony certificates they signed in December 2020 were \u201cused as part of an attempt to improperly overturn\u201d the lawful election results. \u201cWe hereby reaffirm that Joseph R. Biden, Jr. won the 2020 presidential election and that we were not the duly elected presidential electors for the State of Wisconsin for the 2020 presidential election,\u201d a portion of their statement said. \u201cWe oppose any attempt to undermine the public\u2019s faith in the ultimate results of the 2020 presidential election.\u201d Chesebro was previously charged, and pleaded guilty, in the Georgia probe. He has also been identified as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Arizona state-level criminal probe focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s federal election case against Trump. Roman was charged in both the Georgia and Arizona cases. Troupis has not been charged in any other criminal cases stemming from the 2020 election but evidence has emerged in connection with the fake electors plot in Wisconsin and other key battleground states. A tranche of emails and text messages made public as the result of a lawsuit earlier this year offered additional evidence that Chesebro pushed for the electors plot to move forward regardless of whether Trump won any lawsuits challenging the election results. This undercut his testimony to state prosecutors in which he said the fake electors were contingent on winning the litigation. Chesebro wrote\u00a0a series of memos\u00a0in 2020 spelling out what the pro-Trump electors should do in their respective states, including one memo in early December that Troupis claimed he sent directly to the White House, according to the newly released messages. Charging documents released Tuesday lean heavily on the communications, which were previously reported by CNN and others. Prosecutors cite text messages detailing how Chesebro, Troupis and Roman were involved in a last-minute scramble to fly the fake elector documents from Wisconsin and Michigan to Washington, DC, in the immediate lead-up to January 6, 2021. The goal, according to those messages, was to hand deliver the fake elector certificates to then-Vice President Mike Pence, which is vaguely referenced in Smith\u2019s federal indictment. Chesebro discussed the episode with Wisconsin investigators when he sat for an interview as part of the attorney general\u2019s probe into the fake electors plot. Wisconsin prosecutors asked about the episode \u201cextensively,\u201d a source familiar with the matter said at the time, noting Chesebro discussed how a Wisconsin GOP staffer flew the certificate from Milwaukee to Washington and then handed it off to Chesebro.

Garland\u2019s forceful defense of the department and federal law enforcement will begin what is likely to be a tense, hours-long hearing before members of the House Judiciary Committee. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 am ET. In his most explicit comments since his confirmation in 2020, Garland will tell members of the House Judiciary Committee that recent attacks on the Justice Department \u201care unprecedented and unfounded.\u201d \u201cCertain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining \u2013 for no legitimate purpose \u2013 sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\u201d Garland will say, according to the prepared remarks. The attorney general was called to Capitol Hill for a hearing on the department\u2019s work under his leadership, including efforts to combat violent crime and investigate potential threats to the US stemming from conflicts abroad. But Garland, who is at the center of Republican-led contempt proceedings, is prepared to forcefully push back against his critics. Republicans are moving to try to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio tapes of the president\u2019s interview with special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated his handling of classified material and declined to bring charges. The contempt proceedings come \u201calongside false\u00a0claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\u201d Garland will say according to his remarks,\u00a0referring to the New York state trial in which Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records. \u201cThat conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\u201d\u00a0Garland is expected to say. In a letter to Garland ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, House GOP Reps. Chip Roy, Andy Biggs and Thomas Massie accused the Justice Department of \u201caggressive prosecutions of American citizens who were present\u201d at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and demanded a briefing on the matter. The attorney general will also allude to other threats stemming from the federal Trump investigations, including \u201cextremely dangerous falsehoods\u201d being spread about the FBI\u2019s law enforcement operations and \u201cthreats to defund particular Department investigations\u201d like that of special counsel Jack Smith. \u201cIt comes at a time when we are seeing\u00a0heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department\u2019s career public servants,\u201d Garland is expected to say. But the long line of attacks \u201chave not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\u201d \u201cI view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations,\u201d Garland\u2019s remarks say. \u201cI will not be intimidated.\u00a0And the Justice Department will not be intimidated.\u00a0We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence.\u00a0And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_biden-immigration-executive-order", "text": "President Joe Biden is expected to announce\u00a0an executive order as early as Tuesday\u00a0that would effectively shut down the US-Mexico border to asylum-seekers crossing illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded\u00a0\u2013 a sweeping and controversial proposal\u00a0that is likely to receive fierce pushback from progressives\u00a0and immigration advocates. The executive action, described to CNN by multiple people briefed on the order, would mark a significant attempt by Biden to address head on one of his biggest political vulnerabilities, just\u00a0weeks before the first presidential debate with former President Donald Trump. Trump\u00a0has made hard-line\u00a0immigration policies\u00a0a cornerstone of his campaign. The executive order uses an authority known as \u201c212(f)\u201d \u2013 a regulation used under the Trump administration and widely denounced at the time by Democrats. The executive action, which has been in the works for months, would severely restrict migrants from seeking asylum at the US southern border\u00a0if they crossed the border unlawfully\u00a0once daily encounters between\u00a0ports of entry reached 2,500,\u00a0meaning\u00a0that the measure is likely to\u00a0almost\u00a0immediately take effect.\u00a0Migrants could still request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. Unaccompanied children would be exempt \u2013 a key piece of the executive order that would worry immigration advocates who have said such an exemption could encourage some families to send children to the border on their own. The executive action would allow authorities to turn away migrants while in effect either to Mexico or their origin country.\u00a0The US previously worked with Mexico when a Covid-19-era border restriction, known as Title 42, also resulted in certain migrants being returned to Mexico. Sources who described the order to CNN cautioned that changes could still be made to the text before it was expected to be publicly unveiled this week. The action would mark a significant policy shift for the Biden administration, which has taken a more aggressive approach to border security after years of grappling with border crises fueled by record migration\u00a0as it has attempted\u00a0to blunt Republican attacks during a heated election year. Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt slammed Biden\u2019s expected order on Tuesday, saying the president is \u201ccontrolled by radical left Democrats.\u201d Trump sought to use a similar authority to clamp down on border crossings while in office, but was ultimately blocked by a federal appeals court. Border authorities have recently been apprehending just under 4,000 migrants unlawfully crossing the border, according to a Homeland Security official, and there have been\u00a0roughly 1,500 appointments per day through the US Customs and Border Protection mobile app. Under the executive order, the border would reopen once daily illegal crossings drop, according to one of the sources. Senior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients,\u00a0have been calling lawmakers and other stakeholders over the weekend to brief them on the plans, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. CNN first reported that the White House began outreach to border mayors to have them attend the announcement. Edinburg Mayor\u00a0Ramiro\u00a0Garza confirmed to CNN that the administration contacted him on Saturday to attend a Tuesday event at the White House. Brownsville Mayor John Cowen said he was invited as well and will attend.\u00a0Harlingen Mayor Norma Sepulveda and Laredo Mayor Dr. Victor D. Trevino have also confirmed that they are expected to attend the event.\u00a0McAllen Mayor Javier Villalobos also said he was invited but will be unable to attend.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-covid-19-pandemic-hearing-threats-cnntv", "text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci said he sees a direct link between the rise in death threats made against him and his family and public figures connecting him to Covid-19 conspiracy theories, which he noted happened earlier Monday during a contentious House hearing about the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source,\u201d adding that when someone in the media or in Congress \u201cgets up and makes a public statement that I\u2019m responsible for the deaths of X number of people because of policies or some crazy idea that I created the virus \u2013 immediately you can, it\u2019s like clockwork \u2013 the death threats go way up.\u201d The former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was grilled by Republicans on the House Oversight Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic about the US\u2019 handling of Covid-19, the origins of the virus and the use of unofficial emails by some officials at the National Institutes of Health. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in heated remarks during the hearing criticized mask mandates, called for Fauci to be prosecuted for \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and refused to call the former NIAID director \u201cdoctor.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m still getting death threats. When you have performances like that unusual performance by Marjorie Taylor Greene in today\u2019s hearing, those are the kinds of things that drive up the death threats because there are a segment of the population out there that believe that kind of nonsense,\u201d Fauci said. CNN has reached out to Greene\u2019s office for comment. In an emotional moment at Monday\u2019s hearing, Fauci detailed the threats he received during his time as the director of the NIAID. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan asked Fauci to explain what some of the threats were and he replied: \u201cEverything from harassments from emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters.

Andy Kim will win the Democratic nomination for Senate in New Jersey, CNN projects, setting him up as the favorite to succeed indicted\u00a0Sen. Bob Menendez in this deep-blue state. Kim, a three-term congressman from South Jersey, entered the race in September, the day after Menendez was indicted on bribery and corruption charges. He\u00a0quickly emerged as the favorite even with\u00a0New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy launching her campaign later that fall. But in the face of\u00a0mounting nepotism charges and a grassroots progressive\u00a0backlash, Murphy dropped out of the race in March. With Murphy\u2019s exit, Kim\u00a0appeared to be on a glide path to the Senate in a state that last elected a Republican to the chamber in 1972. Menendez, who is on trial in New York City, announced in March that he would not seek reelection in the Democratic primary. But on Monday, he filed to run as an independent \u2013 a move that could make the race more unpredictable, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance. Democrats hold a narrow majority in the chamber but face a difficult landscape this fall. A 41-year-old former diplomat and the son of Korean immigrants, Kim was the first Asian American elected to Congress from\u00a0New Jersey. His\u00a0anti-corruption message and the success of his high-profile legal challenge to New Jersey Democrats\u2019 unbalanced ballot design \u2013 which favored party machine-backed candidates \u2013 quickly made the congressman a hero to progressives.

Pascrell, 87, first entered Congress in 1997 and had\u00a0rarely been faced with a serious primary contest. A staunch supporter of Israel for decades, he had long\u00a0benefited from a place atop the ballot under New Jersey\u2019s arcane \u201ccounty line\u201d system \u2013 which was discarded this year\u00a0after a court battle. Khairullah, who is Muslim, made headlines last year after he was turned away from an Eid reception at the White House to mark the end of Ramadan. During the campaign, he charged Pascrell with turning his back on the district\u2019s Muslim community by failing to respond more forcefully to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The district is home to a large population of Palestinian and Jewish voters, which has further elevated the issue. Pascrell in March called for a \u201cconditional ceasefire\u201d but held back in criticizing the Israeli government. \u201cThe scale of suffering in Gaza is ghastly and unacceptable, and my heart aches for those affected,\u201d Pascrell said\u00a0in a statement at the time. \u201cOnly with a ceasefire of hostilities can we provide the robust support and medical care necessary to address this crisis of historic proportion.\u201d Three months later, the\u00a0Israeli offensive continues, with humanitarian aid only trickling into the besieged enclave\u00a0as the civilian death toll rises.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/new-jersey-primary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The bill, known as the Secure the Border Act, passed the Republican-controlled Arizona House by a party-line 31-29 vote. Arizona will play a key role this election year, as both a battleground state in the presidential race and home to a Senate race that could help determine the balance of power in the US Senate. Immigration has been a central campaign issue for former President Donald Trump and Republicans in the border state and could drive voters to the polls. If voters approve the measure in November, law enforcement would be enabled to arrest migrants who cross into the US without going through official ports of entry. Judges could order the deportation of those convicted of violating the law. Under the proposal, a person who enters the US illegally cannot be arrested unless there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d \u2013 a law enforcement officer has witnessed the violation, there is a recording of the violation or there is \u201cany other constitutionally sufficient\u201d sign of probable cause. Proponents say the measure would curb illegal immigration and cut down on crime perpetrated by migrants, stepping in where the federal government has failed. Meanwhile, critics argue that the proposal would result in racial profiling and unlawful policing, be costly for the state and strain law enforcement resources. The proposal is similar to Texas\u2019 controversial immigration law known as SB 4, which has been blocked from going into effect as a legal challenge plays out in court. If Arizona voters approve the ballot measure, the part of the proposal that would allow local law enforcement to make arrests for illegal entry cannot be enforced until the Texas immigration law or another state\u2019s law has been in effect for 60 days. The Arizona measure would also create criminal offenses for migrants unlawfully in the US who \u201cknowingly\u201d present false documents to receive public benefits or get around the state\u2019s e-verify program. It would increase punishments for fentanyl sales that result in the death of another.

{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_judge-blocks-evidence-hunter-biden-gun-trial", "text": "The federal judge overseeing\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial\u00a0dealt his defense two setbacks Sunday, on the eve of jury selection, by blocking one of his expert witnesses and excluding a key piece of evidence the president\u2019s son hoped to use. The rulings from Judge Maryellen Noreika resolved some of the sticking points that were still simmering before the trial begins Monday. Taken together, these decisions could make a tough case for Hunter Biden even more challenging to win. President Joe Biden\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to illegally buying and owning a gun while abusing illicit drugs. Noreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden\u2019s expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would\u2019ve tried to poke holes in prosecutors\u2019 assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment. \u201cThe inadequacy of Defendant\u2019s expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\u201d Noreika wrote in her ruling. The judge also blocked Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers from using what they thought was a key piece of exculpatory evidence: an altered version of the federal firearms form he filled out when he bought the gun in 2018 that was tweaked in 2021 by the gun store employees. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers\u00a0recently argued in court\u00a0that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically \u201cbiased.\u201d But Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was \u201cirrelevant and inadmissible,\u201d and she went on to blast Hunter Biden\u2019s team for pushing \u201cconspiratorial\u201d theories and \u201cunsupported rhetoric\u201d about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees. \u201cAny probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,\u201d she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees\u2019 alleged political bias would have been \u201cunduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.\u201d Only\u00a0the original form\u00a0\u2013 known as ATF Form 4473 \u2013 will be shown to the jury. On that form, Hunter Biden is accused of falsely swearing that he wasn\u2019t using or addicted to drugs, which allowed him to purchase the gun. Prosecutors contend he was still addicted to crack cocaine at that time, as he has described in\u00a0his memoir.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_republicans-justice-system-what-matters", "text": "Last week, President Joe Biden was defending the justice system as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of society. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Republicans tried to undercut the process that led to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York on state charges. This week, the president will have to remember those words while his son Hunter faces federal gun charges at a trial in Delaware, the first of two separate cases this year that could lead to jail time. The Biden family must be frustrated that a plea deal fell apart last year when it was rejected by the Trump-appointed judge in the case, Maryellen Noreika. Plus, these particular gun charges are rarely prosecuted on their own, perhaps evidence of the enhanced scrutiny placed on a president\u2019s son. Very different trials Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial is very different than Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, even if they both come in an election year, feature the public airing of painful, personal details and essentially boil down to allegations of lying on paperwork. Trump had to endure the detailed, public testimony of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleged an affair with Trump nearly 20 years ago. Hunter Biden will have to endure a public recounting of his affair with his brother Beau\u2019s widow, their tortured text messages and his drug addiction. But Trump\u2019s legal problems all revolve around his own campaigns and actions during and after his presidency. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments meant to cover up the alleged affair from voters in 2016. He also faces federal charges of mishandling classified information in Florida and trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, DC, as well as Georgia. Hunter Biden faces trial in Delaware starting this week for lying on a firearm background check application. He checked the box that said \u201cno\u201d he was not abusing or addicted to drugs. He also faces trial in California later this year for tax evasion. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed special counsel prosecuting the case, has never made allegations to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s tax problems to his father, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried, unsuccessfully, to connect the dots. I\u2019ve written before about how the Department of Justice ends up prosecuting similar numbers of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In New York this week, for instance, the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 his second distinct corruption trial in recent years \u2013 is underway. Trump may ultimately avoid federal prosecution. There is a very real possibility that Trump, while found guilty in a New York courtroom, will face neither set of the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith before Election Day in November. The US Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, and the judge in his classified documents case has delayed proceedings indefinitely. The Georgia case is also delayed, and an appeals court may not consider whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case until October. A chorus of bias allegations But while Joe Biden\u2019s son and the senior senator from New Jersey are both in major legal peril, it is quickly becoming an article of faith among Republicans that they are a targeted species by the justice system. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system,\u201d Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The justice system \u201chunts Republicans while\u00a0protecting Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, reacting to the Trump guilty verdict. In a fundraising pitch on X, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida encouraged supporters angry about the \u201ctravesty\u201d to \u201cget even.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took the conspiracy theorizing much further, arguing that the Department of Justice is only prosecuting Menendez and, separately, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas (who is also charged with bribery) because they have been critical of Biden on foreign relations and immigration policy \u2013 an allegation for which there is no evidence. Cotton predicted Biden would ultimately pardon his son. The White House has said there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden. Even Republicans who opposed Trump during the 2024 primary season are critical of Trump\u2019s New York conviction. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu complained that Trump will face sentencing days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThat is a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to do nothing but rile everybody up. It\u2019s going to look even more political than it is now, and just cast a shadow of a doubt on this entire case.\u201d \u2018I may feel differently about it\u2019 The irony here is that Trump in 2020 actually did pressure the Department of Justice to investigate Hunter Biden. He also pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to open an investigation, hoping to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company to his father. In 2016, Trump\u2019s supporters would launch into \u201clock her up\u201d chants targeting Hillary Clinton \u2013 behavior Trump encouraged at the time even though the FBI, in the form of then-director James Comey, announced before the election that there was not a strong enough case to prosecute Clinton over her private email server. Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that if elected again, he might feel differently about pushing for charges against Clinton. \u201cThey all said \u2018lock her up.\u2019 But I felt \u2013 and I could have done it \u2013 but I thought it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me. So I may feel differently about it,\u201d Trump said. Democrats promise to let the process play out against Hunter Biden Don\u2019t expect Democrats to show the same level of support for Hunter Biden that Republicans have shown for Trump. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised Democrats would respect the process as it plays out against the president\u2019s son. \u201cDemocrats are not out there saying that Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is a farce, it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s rigged.

She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue.

The ICC\u2019s targeting of Netanyahu has sparked widespread backlash from Republicans and Democrats in Congress. President Joe Biden has also forcefully denounced the ICC move, saying \u201cthere is no equivalence\u201d between Israel and Hamas, but the administration has said it does not support the GOP-led effort to sanction the court. It is unlikely that the Senate will take up the sanctions bill. The House passed the bill in a 247 to 155 vote, with 42 Democrats joining Republicans in support.\u00a0Two GOP members voted present. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview last month that the court is seeking arrest warrants for the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. According to the legislative text, the bill would impose sanctions on individuals \u201cengaged in any effort to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies.\u201d The sanctions include prohibiting US property transactions and blocking and revoking visas. Headquartered at The Hague in the Netherlands, the ICC was established in 2002 and is tasked with prosecuting individuals for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The ICC does not have its own enforcement mechanism and has relied on countries\u2019 support for arrests. A decision to seek arrest warrants doesn\u2019t immediately mean an individual is guilty, but is the first stage in a process that could lead to a lengthy trial. Both Hamas and Israeli politicians denounced the ICC\u2019s move. House Speaker Mike Johnson has condemned the ICC over its move to seek warrants for top Israeli officials, saying at the end of last month that Congress would take action \u201cto punish the ICC and ensure its leadership faces consequences if they proceed.\u201d The move against the Israeli politicians mark the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. A panel of ICC judges will consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. A Biden administration statement of policy on the bill states that the administration \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the legislation. \u201cThe Administration is deeply concerned about the ICC Prosecutor\u2019s heedless rush to apply for arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials. At the same time, the Administration opposes the imposition of sanctions against the ICC, its personnel, its judges, or those who assist its work. There are more effective ways to defend Israel, preserve U.S. positions on the ICC, and promote international justice and accountability, and the Administration stands ready to work with the Congress on those options,\u201d the statement reads. Congressional Democrats and Biden continue to face intense pressure from different constituencies over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful to see 42 Democrats in the House vote with Republicans to undermine human rights around the world by sanctioning the ICC, all to shield Netanyahu from arrest,\u201d Josh Ruebner, the policy director for the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project, a pro-Palestinian advocacy group, said in a statement.

These new patterns are creating challenges for each party.

For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_mexico-woman-president-what-matters", "text": "While American voters are looking at the same old options in their coming election, Mexican voters will choose between two women as the major-party candidates in their presidential election this weekend. Women in Mexico did not enjoy universal suffrage until 1953, a full 33 years after women gained the right in the US, but the country is almost sure to have its first female leader before the US does. CNN\u2019s Tara John points out in an analysis for CNN International that Mexico\u2019s likely election of a woman as president is \u201ca remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day.\u201d But the breaking of Mexico\u2019s glass ceiling will also be overshadowed by the multifaceted problems of gang violence, targeted politicians and rampant crime. Read more. The influence of women in Mexican politics is evident in other branches of government. Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court elected its first female chief justice in January 2023. Her court also decriminalized abortion in Mexico, an inverse of the US, where five conservatives on the US Supreme Court (four men and one woman) overruled the court\u2019s liberals (two women and one man at that time) to take nationwide abortion rights away from American women in June 2022. Some of the reasons for Mexico\u2019s move toward political gender parity are structural. Mexican law requires political parties there to put equal numbers of women and men up for election. That\u2019s not going to happen in the US. There are also one-term limits on presidents, forcing more turnover. The current front-runner in Mexico\u2019s presidential election, Claudia Sheinbaum, is on the ballot because her party\u2019s popular president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, must step aside. The Supreme Court has a woman as chief justice in part because justices in Mexico serve 15-year terms. I talked to Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, about obstacles American women face in politics. She noted that the progress American women had been making for decades at the state level, beginning in the 1970s, had stalled until after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, when a new generation of American women got active. Since the 2018 midterms\ufeff, though, progress has slowed. Now, according to CAWP\u2019s tally for 2024: Those figures continue to slowly grow, but they are nowhere near gender parity. By comparison, half of the legislators in Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress are women, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In countries with quota systems, the move toward parity has been much quicker, but Walsh said we shouldn\u2019t expect such a system in the US. \u201cThe concept of quotas, as you well know, is sort of antithetical to the American image of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the best candidates will rise to the top,\u201d Walsh said. When I asked what obstacles women face in US politics, she rattled off a list. Republicans elect fewer women First, Walsh said, there is an obvious partisan element. More elected women are Democrats, which might seem obvious. But the imbalance is amplified at the state level and in legislatures, where most elected representatives serve. Just picking one state, Georgia, she pointed out that 59% of Democratic legislators are women compared with 16% of Republican legislators. In Florida, two-thirds of Democratic legislators are women compared with less than a third of Republicans. See data for all the states here. Walsh argued that both parties must do a better job of recruiting and supporting women who run for office, and she said it\u2019s important to make sure women are running in seats where they can win, as opposed to seats where they have no chance. Part of the reason for the imbalance is due to policy, but it\u2019s also a matter of priorities in how Republicans recruit candidates, Walsh argued. \u201cThe philosophy of the party generally is the best candidate will rise to the top, and whether it\u2019s a man or a woman or a person of color or a White person, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. Campaign finance is a problem for female candidates The way campaigns are funded is an obstacle, according to Walsh, because women are less likely to be able to fund their own campaigns. \u201cWe know that parties love self-funders, because a self-funding candidate is less of a strain on the party itself in terms of providing support,\u201d she said. She argued that women also tend to raise money in smaller amounts, less than $200, which makes the process of fundraising much more arduous. Politics feels more dangerous \u201cPolitics has gotten particularly ugly, fraught and dangerous,\u201d Walsh said, pointing to the 2020 kidnapping plot against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Walsh argued that online threats seem to disproportionately affect female officeholders and candidates. That perception could have a chilling effect on women seeking office. Walsh does think the US will ultimately elect a woman as president. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating process to see how slow it can be,\u201d she said. Hillary Clinton was the first woman to be a major-party presidential nominee in 2016, and Kamala Harris became the first woman to be elected to nationwide office when she shared the Democratic presidential ticket with Joe Biden in 2020. Notably, Democrats selected Biden from a field that included six women, including Harris, that cycle. Trump could also choose a woman as his running mate for this November\u2019s election. But it seems unlikely that he will pick the only Republican woman to ever win a presidential primary, Nikki Haley, who won contests in Vermont and the District of Columbia this year. When I noted Haley\u2019s success to Walsh as a sign of progress, she countered: \u201cShe\u2019s not the nominee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/mexico-woman-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to call out his predecessor Donald Trump as a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d for the first time represents a significant hardening of his rhetoric against his Republican general election foe. Biden\u2019s escalation at an off-camera fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday evening came as some Democrats pressed for a more robust political attack on the presumptive Republican nominee following his guilty verdict in his New York hush money trial last week. \u201cFor the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\u201d Other Democratic officials have used such rhetoric. But the phrase took on greater force coming from the mouth of the president himself. While Republicans have rallied around Trump since his conviction, it remains unclear how the verdict will go down in swing states where the shift in a few thousand votes could decide November\u2019s election. Biden\u2019s remark was yet another stunning turn in an election entangled in Trump\u2019s multiple legal threats. It came on a day when the first family was embroiled in its own extraordinary courtroom drama as Biden\u2019s son Hunter became the first child of a sitting president to go on trial. The younger Biden has pleaded not guilty to charges of buying and possessing a gun illegally while addicted to or abusing drugs. He also faces a tax trial in September. Last week, Biden noted that Trump had been convicted on 34 felony counts and said it was \u201creckless \u2026 dangerous \u2026 and irresponsible\u201d for his opponent to say the verdict was rigged. Presidential remarks in off-camera fundraisers can often serve as a test bed for rhetoric that later emerges in public events. But Biden\u2019s sharpened tone will certainly lead to accusations by the Trump campaign that the former president\u2019s conviction came after a process of political weaponization of the justice system. In another significant legal development Monday, Trump got good news from Georgia, where he is among multiple defendants in a racketeering case over his attempt to steal the swing state from Biden\u2019s column in the 2020 election. The Georgia Court of Appeals set oral arguments for October 4 over an effort to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. It was just the latest blow to prosecutors pursuing Trump over his election interference case. The timing of the arguments \u2014 only a month before Election Day \u2014 makes for an impossibly short timeframe for a trial. The Georgia case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been delayed by defendants\u2019 attempt to disqualify Willis after she employed a prosecutor with whom she was in a relationship. Other Trump cases are in suspended animation Two federal cases against Trump, in which he\u2019s also pleaded not guilty, are in a holding pattern. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on Trump\u2019s sweeping demand for immunity for actions he undertook while president. The justices could still deliver a definitive ruling, but any decision that requires further litigation in lower courts could mean time runs out in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case with only five months to go before Election Day. At the same time, multiple disputes in pre-trial motions have put the looming federal trial in Florida over Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents into suspended animation. Democrats have accused Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon of showing political bias in her rulings. The logjam on multiple fronts means that it may prove impossible for the US legal system to account for the alleged attempt by a former president to stay in power against the will of voters before he has the chance to win another mandate. In itself, the delay represents a significant threat to American democracy\u2019s bid to save itself since it suggests that a future president who acted the same way Trump did might expect impunity. Trump\u2019s avoidance of accountability over 2020 election interference \u2014 through a mixture of skilled litigation by his lawyers, some backfiring decisions by prosecutors and luck \u2014 would also hugely raise the stakes of November\u2019s election. If Trump loses, his future after already losing one criminal case looks incredibly grim, with three cases that are likely to eventually get to trials that will entail massive legal fees. But if Trump wins, he could appoint an attorney general who could halt the federal cases in their tracks. And his Justice Department would be sure to make every effort to delay or defray any negative outcome he faces in the Georgia case as well as the New York hush money conviction that is due to proceed to sentencing on July 11. Given the personal stakes, it\u2019s reasonable to assume Trump will not stop at anything to regain power at a time when he\u2019s refusing to guarantee accepting the result of the 2024 election. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House counsel, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday that the date set in Georgia in October means there is \u201cno possibility of this case going to trial before the election.\u201d\u00a0And he added that the chances were rising that Trump could avoid any legal accountability for his actions in 2020 if he wins in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s very real if he wins the election, it\u2019s not real at all if he loses,\u201d Cobb said. Referring to the federal election interference case and the classified documents matter, Cobb said, \u201cBoth of those will end up going at some point if Trump loses in early to mid next year and the Georgia case will likely follow that along.\u201d History made in Delaware The sluggish pace of Trump\u2019s criminal trials contrasts with the efficiency of those facing Hunter Biden, who\u2019s also due to face trial on tax charges in September. The cases of the former president and the current president\u2019s son are not analogous, and those surrounding Trump are hugely complicated. But they are sure to leave many Democrats marveling at the prospect that the only federal trial entangled with this year\u2019s election could be one that is targeting Hunter Biden and not Trump, whose actions after the 2020 election stretched US democracy to its limit. Joe Biden pledged on Monday not to comment on the outcome of a federal trial, but in a statement, he expressed boundless love for his son and his respect for his success in overcoming addiction to crack cocaine. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a dad,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s cranked up rhetoric at the Monday fundraiser follows a warning by Trump in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday of the consequences if Judge Juan Merchan imposed any jail term following the guilty verdict last week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the public would stand for it,\u201d the former president said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there\u2019s a breaking point.\u201d Some senior Democrats accused Trump of inciting violence in his remarks, which took on a more ominous complexion given his past invocation to supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \u201cThis is clearly Donald Trump once again inciting violence, potential violence, when he is sentenced,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff told Kasie Hunt on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\u00a0 The California Democrat accused Trump of issuing \u201cyet another dangerous appeal to violence.\u201d The extraordinary tangling of the 2024 election and legal cases weighing on both Trump and Biden is likely to dominate a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday when Attorney General Merrick Garland will brave a new grilling by Republicans. Garland vowed to restore trust in the legal system when he took office following the tumultuous Trump years by making sure everyone plays by the same rules. Three years on, he\u2019s frustrated much of Washington with a quest that looks quaint in an era when judges, prosecutors and juries in a proliferating wave of politically loaded cases are under almost constant attack. But hostility toward Garland has not come just from Republicans, who will be looking for vengeance on Tuesday following Trump\u2019s conviction. Democrats fret over the slow pace of the federal investigations. And the White House complained to Garland after special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report on Joe Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents portrayed the president\u2019s memory as significantly degraded in a report that unleashed weeks of political reverberations, CNN reported. Garland is also likely to face scrutiny over the Hunter Biden trial. House Republicans have seized on the case to try to damage the president politically, especially after failing to provide any evidence that he profited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in their misfiring impeachment investigation.

And so it\u2019s an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence,\u201d Biden said, referring to Netanyahu\u2019s proposed judicial overhaul that had drawn angry protests before the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas that sparked the current conflict. \u201cWhether he would change his position or not, it\u2019s hard to say, but it has not been helpful,\u201d Biden said. The president made the comments last week as he was preparing to deliver a speech laying out what he said was an Israeli proposal to end the war and secure the release of hostages. The speech was intended to apply pressure on Hamas and Israel to end the war, but the effect of his remarks was to put Netanyahu on the spot as the war in Gaza grinds ahead. So far, Netanyahu has yet to publicly endorse the plan, despite it being an Israeli proposal, and members of his far-right government have threatened to quit should the plan be adopted. The president\u2019s decision to spell out in detail Israel\u2019s plan underscored his growing impatience at the logjam in talks to secure the release of hostages. \u201cBibi is under enormous pressure on the hostages \u2026 and so he\u2019s prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back,\u201d Biden said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname. Speaking on Tuesday after the interview was published, Biden again acknowledged the pressures facing Netanyahu when asked if the prime minister was \u201cplaying politics\u201d with the war in Gaza. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s trying to work out a serious problem he has,\u201d Biden told reporters after a speech on immigration. Relations between Biden and Netanyahu have become strained in recent months as the war drags on. The US has grown frustrated at some of Israel\u2019s war tactics, which officials believe do not include stringent enough protections for civilians. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby downplayed Biden\u2019s comments to Time on Tuesday, telling reporters,\u00a0\u201cI think the president was very clear in his answer on that, and we\u2019ll let the prime minister speak to his own politics and to what his critics are saying, and the president was referencing what many critics have said.\u201d Biden said in the interview it wasn\u2019t clear whether Israel\u2019s actions constitute war crimes, an allegation made by the International Criminal Court when it issued arrest warrants for some Israeli leaders. But he did say Israel had engaged in \u201cin activity that is inappropriate.\u201d \u201cThe answer is it\u2019s uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t recognize,\u201d Biden said when asked whether he believed Israel had committed war crimes in Gaza. \u201cBut one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed. But it is \u2013 and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak. Hamas is intimidating that population.\u201d Inside the White House, many view Netanyahu\u2019s unwillingness to end the war as reflective of his fragile political standing. That precarious position could become even shakier once investigations into potential missed signals ahead of the October 7 attacks begin. In the interview, Biden declined to place blame directly on Netanyahu for any security failings. \u201cI don\u2019t know how any one person has that responsibility. He was the leader of the country, so therefore, it happened. But he wasn\u2019t the only one that didn\u2019t pick it up,\u201d Biden said. Instead, he said his principal disagreement with the Israeli leader was his refusal to begin planning for post-war Gaza and his rejection of an eventual Palestinian state. \u201cMy major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza\u2019s over? What, what does it go back to?\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cThere needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that\u2019s my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\u201d Kirby acknowledged that Biden and Netanyahu have clashed in the past, including on the viability of a two-state solution, \u201cbut for our part, we\u2019re going to make sure that Israel has what it needs to continue to eliminate the threat by Hamas, and that we\u2019re going to continue to work with the prime minister and the war cabinet to try to get this proposal over the finish line \u2013 a proposal, I would add that was an Israeli proposal that they crafted after some diplomatic conversations with us, and which they\u2019ve acknowledged is their proposal, so that\u2019s what our focus is going to be on.\u201d CNN\u2019s Donald Judd contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-hints-netanyahu-is-dragging-out-gaza-war-for-political-survival/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_trump-conviction-consequences-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s first act on becoming a convicted criminal was to launch a raging new attack on the rule of law, laying bare the gravity of the choice awaiting America\u2019s voters. In one sense, Trump\u2019s conviction on all counts in his first criminal trial affirmed the principle on which the United States is founded \u2014 that everyone is equal and that no one, not even a billionaire and former and possibly future president, enjoys impunity. But Trump\u2019s authoritarian outburst minutes after the guilty verdict in New York and a race by top Republicans to join his assault on the justice system underscore how threatened those bedrock values now are. \u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said minutes after a jury foreperson announced he was guilty on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star. After returning to Trump Tower and greeting supporters with a clenched fist, Trump issued a written statement that made clear that he views his own fate and the nation\u2019s as indistinguishable \u2014 a familiar hallmark of a dictatorial leader. \u201cI\u2019m a very innocent man, and it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fighting for our country. I\u2019m fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now,\u201d Trump wrote. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign echoed his opponent\u2019s belief that the ultimate judgment on the former president will come in the general election. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality,\u201d said campaign communications director Michael Tyler. \u201cThere is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater.\u201d A moment of personal anguish with national consequences Trump\u2019s conviction by a unanimous New York jury was the most painful low of a tumultuous life of denying accountability that has seen financial boom and bust, three marriages, television stardom, frequent brushes with the law, the triumph of his outsider 2016 election win, a norm-shattering presidency and an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power after losing in 2020. Judging by his red-faced shock outside the courtroom, the verdict was a moment of personal anguish. Given that he\u2019s got a good chance of being the next president, it is sure to become a grave national test as well. Trump had pleaded not guilty in a trial that is one of four criminal cases entangled with the 2024 presidential election and the only one likely to see a jury before the election. Responses to any motions from the defense in the hush money case are due by June 27 \u2014 the day of the first presidential debate, hosted by CNN. Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is set for July 11, just days before he\u2019ll secure the nomination at the Republican National Convention and around when he\u2019s said he\u2019d announce his vice presidential pick. Already, his legal defenses have morphed with his political strategy in a narrative of political persecution, and he is vowing that he will devote a possible second term to \u201cretribution\u201d against his foes. Among an electorate that Trump has constantly polarized, the verdict is likely to be greeted with fury by his supporters and jubilation by his critics. But in truth, this is a somber and even tragic passage of US history. Americans have never seen an ex-president convicted of a crime, and a country already torn apart by bitter political and cultural polarization is likely in for a rocky time. The implications are enormous. They begin with the potential consequences for an election in five months that could be decided by the shift of just a few thousand votes in a few states. Trump has been preparing voters for months for the possibility that he would be found guilty in a case that prosecutors said centered around a bid to mislead voters in 2016. He\u2019s claimed his four criminal indictments are a plot by Biden to destroy him. In essence, he\u2019s been working to shatter his greatest norm yet \u2014 the idea that it would be unthinkable for a felon to serve as president. No one can know how voters will react to Trump\u2019s latest moment of ignominy. His conviction will certainly energize his loyal base and his campaign will try to create a backlash to the verdict among more moderate voters. If they succeed, Thursday could come to be remembered as the day Biden lost the election. Or, the guilty verdict could play into Biden\u2019s campaign theme that his predecessor is too corrupt and extreme to serve as president again. Moderate and suburban voters whom Trump has always struggled to attract could be further alienated. But Trump\u2019s tactics and his capacity to shape the views of his supporters \u2014 with the aid of the conservative media machine \u2014 will inevitably mean that the legal system will join the electoral system as another essential institution of American governance that is now viewed as illegitimate by millions of citizens. And if it is Trump who raises his hand to swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution on January 20 as the 47th president, America will be led by a criminal whose duties will include being the symbolic head of the justice system. The danger is acute because with his attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election, Trump has already shown he will do what it takes to save himself, even if his actions catastrophically hurt democratic institutions. Profound reverberations of the Trump trial verdict CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali said Thursday that Trump\u2019s call to arms for a campaign against the legal system will mean that every Republican will be forced to put it at the center of their 2024 campaigns. \u201cThat is going to create, in my view, a torrent of poison that will be likely worse than we saw in the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign that preceded January 6. And that is going to further unsettle an already sensitive country,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cI worry about it because the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign created widespread doubt about the honesty of our electoral system and led many people to believe that fraud had been committed in 2020.\u201d A question that long hovered over this trial is whether the crime \u2014 falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to mislead voters in 2016 \u2014 was sufficiently serious for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to risk the extraordinary political consequences of indicting an ex-president. Prosecutors\u2019 use of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen as their star witness, despite his own conviction on tax charges and for lying to Congress, was deeply controversial. Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday that the timing of the trial \u2014 in the middle of an election campaign \u2014 was unfair to the ex-president. But the charges were not just cooked up by prosecutors as Trump claimed. They were brought by a grand jury. The ex-president was offered the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and he was judged by a jury of his peers. Even now, the Constitution he claims has been hijacked will protect him with a full array of appeals, as in all of his other criminal cases. But once a jury has delivered a verdict, justice is considered served. So the immediate Republican attacks on the judge, the court and the verdict represent an extraordinary effort by one of the country\u2019s two major political parties to turn against the integrity of the legal system. The GOP is showing \u2014 after failing to convict Trump in two impeachments and after many of its most prominent members repeated his lies about the 2020 election \u2014 that there is nothing that he can do that will sever the party\u2019s cult-like embrace of its leader. This suggests that any Trump second term would feature even fewer constraints than his wild first one. And it raises questions about his claim to be running a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign. One of the first Republicans to react was New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair who is seen as a possible Trump vice presidential pick. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict shows how corrupt, rigged, and un-American the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cFrom the start, the weaponized scales of justice were stacked against President Trump.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, who traveled to support Trump during his trial and helped to fuel false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, brought the symbolic weight of his office to support Trump and attack the legal system. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history. Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon. This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one,\u201d the Louisiana Republican claimed. Another top Trump ally, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said there was never a chance of a fair trial in a city which drew its jury pool from one of the most liberal areas in America. \u201cThis verdict says more about the system than the allegations. It will be seen as politically motivated and unfair, and it will backfire tremendously on the political Left,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is a mockery of justice.\u201d Graham\u2019s comment promoted an idea that\u2019s taken hold among conservatives that a Republican leader can only get a fair trial if they are judged in a jurisdiction where they are popular \u2014 a proposition that would effectively permanently politicize justice. One Republican who refused to join the rush to trash the verdict is former \ufeffMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who\u2019s running for Senate. \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders\u2014regardless of party\u2014must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\u201d Hogan said in a statement ahead of the verdict being announced. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign wrote on X: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d Hogan\u2019s comment would once have been a standard Republican reaction to the conviction of a top-level politician. In another age, a guilty verdict would have immediately ended Trump\u2019s campaign. The fact that the newly convicted criminal is already using it as a springboard to power speaks to volatile days ahead. \u201cThis verdict shows two different things,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe first is that the former president can be indicted and found guilty by a group of his peers. And that shows the strength of our system. The other verdict, though, hasn\u2019t come in and the other verdict is, can the powerful use our political system to escape the consequences of being found guilty? And that verdict is in November.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/trump-conviction-consequences-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_supreme-court-trump-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite Supreme Court justices might not even be the three he nominated. Trump congratulated Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush, after the jurist on Wednesday refused to recuse himself from cases related to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol or the 2020 election. Alito said in a letter to lawmakers that he didn\u2019t know that his wife had raised an upside-down flag in the days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021. In any event, the deeds of his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, don\u2019t meet his threshold for recusal. Alito\u00a0also\u00a0addressed\u00a0the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag \u2013 which some interpret as pushing for more religion in the public space and has also become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 that was flown at the justice\u2019s New Jersey beach house last summer.\u00a0He said his wife flew the flag, which dates back to the American Revolution, and neither was aware of its current connotation. But Trump was doing the social media equivalent of a fist pump at Alito\u2019s declaration when he said this on his social media platform: Congratulations to United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for showing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u201cGUTS\u201d to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related. All U.S. Judges, Justices, and Leaders should have such GRIT - Our Country would be far more advanced than its current status as A BADLY FAILING NATION, headed by the Worst President in American History, Crooked Joe Biden! The Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether Trump, as a former president, should enjoy some level of super immunity from prosecution. It\u2019s a complicated case, but certainly Alito was one of the justices most open to immunity claims during oral arguments in April. Alito is also the justice who wrote the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the landmark opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion for American women. While Trump has waffled on how to handle the abortion issue now that there is a patchwork of laws across the country, his latest position is to leave the matter up to states, not unlike what Alito suggested in writing the opinion. The actions of Alito\u2019s wife, flying an upside-down flag as part of a neighborhood dispute over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, are well within someone\u2019s First Amendment rights. It\u2019s also true that the Alitos\u2019  judgment in how a Supreme Court justice should appear objective is suspect. These relatively innocuous, political expressions pale in comparison to the actions of another Supreme Court spouse: Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, who in addition to being married to Justice Clarence Thomas (who was nominated in 1991 by George H.W. Bush) is a conservative activist featured prominently in the House January 6 report. She was actively strategizing around the fake elector scheme by which Trump\u2019s allies wanted to upend Biden\u2019s victory. In text messages with Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Ginni Thomas referred to the 2020 election as a \u201cheist.\u201d She later told the January 6 committee she regretted the messages. Unlike Alito, who responded to lawmakers\u2019 calls for his recusal, Thomas has stayed silent on the matter, although it is clear at this point he will not be recusing himself from any January 6-related cases. Read more from CNN\u2019s Devan Cole. The perception of political bias among Supreme Court spouses does not necessarily mean anything about the political leanings of their powerful husbands, although Alito and Thomas form the core of the conservative majority that currently dominates the Supreme Court.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_immigration-biden-border-authority", "text": "The Biden administration is quickly invoking an authority to shut off access to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally,\u00a0a significant attempt by President Joe Biden to address head on one of his biggest political vulnerabilities. Biden unveiled the sweeping executive action Tuesday afternoon at the White House, attempting to use executive action to affect the situation on the border after a bipartisan measure failed earlier this year. The action marks the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border as Biden tries to gain the upper hand on immigration just weeks from the first presidential debate \u2013 by using the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. The White House announced the action would take effect at midnight. In a speech at the White House, Biden said Republicans in Congress who blocked a bipartisan border deal left him no choice but to take executive action. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0moving past Republican\u00a0obstruction and using the\u00a0executive authorities available to\u00a0me as president to do what I\u00a0can on my own to address the\u00a0border,\u201d Biden said. The new executive action bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum \u2013 a departure from decades-long protocol \u2013 once a daily threshold is met. Unless they meet certain exemptions, migrants will be turned away to Mexico or returned to their origin country. Border authorities encountered around 3,500 migrants crossing the border unlawfully on Monday, according to a Homeland Security official, above the threshold needed for the executive action to take effect. Homeland Security officials have recently been arresting just under 4,000 migrants daily at the US-Mexico border, a brief reprieve from record numbers late last year. The number of people crossing the US southern border has consistently been a challenge for the Biden administration as officials grapple with record migration across the Western Hemisphere. The measure could be turned on and off. Senior administration officials told reporters Tuesday it would be lifted when there\u2019s a daily average of less than 1,500 encounters in between ports of entry. Unaccompanied children, victims of a severe form of trafficking, those who present an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life and safety \u2013 among select others \u2013 are exempt. Migrants can also still request an appointment through the Customs and Border Protection mobile application, known as CBP One, to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. Biden and his administration made clear that they would have rather had bipartisan legislation to sign that addressed the crisis at the border. \u201cFrankly, I would have preferred to address this issue through bipartisan legislation because that\u2019s the only way to actually get the kind of system we have now that\u2019s broken, fixed. To hire more Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, more judges. But Republicans have left me no choice,\u201d Biden said in the speech from the East Room of the White House. Critics have blasted the move as akin to steps taken under Trump. As a candidate, Biden blasted the Trump administration as \u201cinhumane\u201d on the border. On a call with reporters Tuesday previewing the new action, one official defended the steps as separate and apart from Trump\u2019s, while acknowledging they\u2019re prepared for legal challenges, \u201cfrankly, from both sides of the political spectrum.\u201d \u201cThe Trump administration attacked almost every facet of the immigration system, and did so in a shameful and inhumane way,\u201d one official said Tuesday. \u201cThe action will not ban people based on their religion, it will not separate kids from their mothers. There\u2019re also narrow humanitarian exceptions to the bar on asylum, including for those facing an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life or safety \u2013 the Trump administration\u2019s actions did not include these exceptions.\u201d The president responded to criticism from progressives and others who have likened the move as similar to steps taken under Trump. \u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you that be patient and the good will of the American people is wearing thin right now. Doing nothing is not an option. We have to act. We must act consistent with both our law and our values. Our values as Americans. I take these steps today, not to walk away from who we are as Americans, to make sure we preserve who we are for future generations to come,\u201d he said. Biden also directly repudiated the former president. \u201cI will never demonize immigrants, I will never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country. And further I\u2019ll never separate children from their families at the border. I will not ban people from this country because of their religious beliefs. I will not use the US military to go into neighborhoods all across the country to pull millions of people out of their homes and away from their families, to put detention camps while awaiting deportation, as my predecessor says he\u2019ll do if he occupies this office again,\u201d Biden said. Senior administration officials acknowledged that federal resources are strained, which could pose a challenge, but they maintain that the measure will help them remove people more quickly. Migrants who don\u2019t claim a fear may be removed within days or hours, while those that do will be screened and, if found ineligible, removed. Homeland Security officials have been preparing for an anticipated rise in border crossings, consistent with previous years when numbers tick up in the summer, including shifting resources to meet a potential surge and getting personnel in place. Senior administration officials Tuesday cited the measure as a tool to help head off that potential increase. The action also relies heavily on cooperation from Mexico, who previously agreed to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela as part of an effort to cut down on illegal migration in the hemisphere and has significantly ramped up immigration enforcement as part of ongoing efforts. Officials declined to say Tuesday if any new agreement had been reached with Mexico around Tuesday\u2019s executive action.

Instead, Hunter Biden was seen at the White House and in Delaware at his father\u2019s side amid what the president\u2019s allies acknowledge is a difficult moment for both men. They attended a White House state dinner for Kenya last month; marked the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president\u2019s eldest son, at church last week; and cycled together along a trail in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday. The president also planned to spend most of Monday in Wilmington, where jury selection for the trial \u2013 the first of a sitting US president\u2019s child \u2013 is underway. He traveled there\u00a0Sunday evening, arriving earlier than originally planned. As proceedings were getting underway, first lady Jill Biden \u2014 who, like her husband, has remained supportive and protective of Hunter amid his addiction and legal problems \u2014 was seen arriving at the courthouse. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d the president said in a statement Monday. \u201cHunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\u201d he went on. \u201cAs the President, I don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. For the president, the legal problems facing his son have been reason to pull him close, rather than push him away. Joe Biden has paid little mind to some of his allies who question the approach. Instead, his concern for his son\u2019s well-being surpasses any potential political fallout, advisers have said. That concern has appeared at moments to be all-consuming, including in the darkest moments of Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, when the president and his family desperately sought to head off a self-destructive cycle. Joe Biden still speaks with or texts with his son almost daily, particularly as his legal issues mounted. The president told an interviewer last year his son had done \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d and that the only way Hunter Biden\u2019s legal issues were affecting his presidency was in creating a surge of fatherly pride. \u201cIt impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\u201d he said on MSNBC. As the gun trial gets underway, Biden will be heading overseas to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. There is little question he will remain in regular touch with his son while abroad and will keep abreast of the trial amid a heavy schedule of commemorations, speeches and a state visit in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron. But neither he nor the White House is expected to speak proactively about the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team generally operates separately from the president and his campaign, and there are few who believe there would be much benefit in the president weighing in publicly. Prosecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case. Most notably, they\u2019ve\u00a0lined up testimony\u00a0from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife,\u00a0Kathleen Buhle, and his late brother\u2019s widow,\u00a0Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated. Their testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019. There was a time last summer when the president and his orbit believed Hunter Biden\u2019s legal ordeal would end with a plea deal and that the family would be able to close a dark chapter. Those hopes were dashed when the agreement fell apart and, weeks later, a special counsel was appointed to oversee the investigation into the president\u2019s son, opening the prospect of prolonged legal battles overlapping with Joe Biden\u2019s run for reelection. But many in Biden\u2019s orbit suggest his son\u2019s legal issues will not be a driving concern for voters heading into November\u2019s election. Still, few issues are more sensitive inside the Biden White House than the president\u2019s son, from his addiction battles to his legal woes. That has largely left Hunter Biden and his team to go on their own offense, accusing Republicans and others of trying to use his addiction issues for political profit. \u201cThey are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they\u2019re trying to destroy a presidency,\u201d\u00a0Hunter\u00a0Biden said in a podcast released late last year. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s not about me, and \u2026 what they\u2019re trying to do is they\u2019re trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/president-biden-hunter-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_netanyahu-scheduled-speech-congress", "text": "A date for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress remains uncertain after one date initially floated was ruled out because it fell on a Jewish holiday. A US congressional leadership aide initially said Monday that Netanyahu was scheduled to speak on June 13, which falls on\u00a0Shavuot. It also coincides with President Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Italy for a Group of 7 summit. House Speaker Mike Johnson said congressional leaders are looking at various options for Netanyahu to address Congress in light of the scheduling issue. \u201cWe are trying to get this done in the next couple of weeks, and there is a sense of urgency on our side and the prime minister\u2019s, so I hope we can get it done,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told reporters Monday evening. Johnson added, \u201cWe have a couple different options we are looking at \u2014 his staff and mine \u2014 so we will figure it out.\u201d A source familiar with the planning of the visit said Netanyahu is likely to come to Washington in July to address Congress. The top four congressional Republican and Democratic leaders\u00a0extended the invitation\u00a0to Netanyahu last week, but it wasn\u2019t clear at the time whether the prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington would also include a meeting at the White House. Scheduling the speech while Biden is on another continent would have skirted that question. Biden is planning to attend a summit of Group of 7 leaders in Puglia, Italy, which runs from June 13 to 15. The dates have been set for several months. Biden and Netanyahu have spoken by phone regularly since the October 7 attacks by Hamas that set off the current grinding conflict in Gaza, and they last met in person when the president flew to Tel Aviv in the days immediately following the attack. The leaders\u2019 relationship, however, has become strained over Israel\u2019s war plans and over efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in the Palestinian enclave. The decision this year to invite Netanyahu to speak to a joint meeting of Congress was not met with unanimous approval among Democrats, some of whom have vowed to boycott the speech. The war in Gaza has divided Democrats; many in the party say Netanyahu has become an obstacle to peace. Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called earlier this year for new elections in Israel, with the implication Netanyahu leave power. But the New York Democrat nonetheless signed on to the letter inviting the prime minister to speak to Congress. \u201cWe join the State of Israel in your struggle against terror, especially as Hamas continues to hold American and Israeli citizens captive and its leaders jeopardize regional stability,\u201d stated the letter from Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Last week, Biden laid out an Israeli proposal to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a ceasefire, hoping to break a logjam in the stalled negotiations. The move, which was unusual in the level of detail being revealed about another government\u2019s proposal, seemed designed to put Netanyahu on the spot to either support the framework or reject what Biden said was the Israeli government\u2019s own plan. Israel has declined to formally endorse the proposal, however, and Netanyahu told the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that \u201cthe claim that we agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met is not true.\u201d He appeared to be referring to the permanent ceasefire outlined in the second phase of the Israeli proposal. Speaking to reporters Monday, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby repeated Biden\u2019s assertion that the proposal the president spelled out was an Israeli plan. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that it represents fairly and honestly an Israeli proposal \u2013 a very forward-leaning Israeli proposal, and we\u2019re confident that Hamas needs to take it,\u201d he said.

In the letter sent Monday and made public Tuesday, Trump\u2019s attorneys said the justification for the gag order was \u201cto protect the integrity of this criminal proceeding and avoid prejudice to the jury.\u201d The argument to lift the gag order is \u201ceven stronger\u201d since President Joe Biden has publicly commented on the guilty verdict against Trump, certain witnesses have commented and a presidential debate is scheduled for later this month, the letter states. When asked about the status of the gag order, a court spokesman said, \u201cthe order is part of the court record that has been made publicly available and it speaks for itself.\u201d In March, just before the trial started\u00a0Merchan\u00a0granted prosecutors\u2019 request for a gag order that precluded Trump from making public statements about any witnesses in the case, jurors, prosecutors, court staff, or members of their family.

Circuit case (which resulted in the D.C Circuit issuing an order restricting his speech), and given that the eve of trial is upon us, it is without question that the imminency of the risk of harm is now paramount.\u201c Merchan\u00a0fined Trump $10,000 and found him in criminal contempt for violating the gag order 10 times early in the trial and raised the prospect that he might have to jail Trump if he continued to do so.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "politics"}}
