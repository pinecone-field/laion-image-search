The dramatic move in a committee known for bipartisan cooperation \u2013 which was first reported by Punchbowl News \u2013 speaks to Republican Sen. Jim Risch\u2019s frustration\u00a0with the inability\u00a0to reach a deal, especially after a similar bill passed the House last week that had the support of 42 Democrats. \u201cThere were numerous phone calls between a bipartisan group of senators who were galvanized to work on legislation regarding doing something on the ICC, but over the course of the last three weeks that motivation seems to have gone away,\u201d according\u00a0to source familiar\u00a0with the dynamics. Suzanne Wrasse, a Risch spokesperson, said the senator from Idaho \u201cis willing to pursue multiple avenues for the Senate to work on ICC legislation, but despite several offers made by Risch and his colleagues to negotiate, Democrats have not responded substantively and we haven\u2019t made progress.\u201d Republicans believe the fastest way to pass a sanctions bill would be for the Senate to take up one that passed the House, especially as the number of legislative days before the August recess are shrinking. But Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, criticized the House measure as a \u201cdivisive partisan bill\u201d and said he is trying to reach a deal with Republicans to move bipartisan sanctions legislation. \u201cDefending Israel from this flawed and biased prosecution deserves the same united support we share for the entire US-Israel relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitical maneuvering by Republicans have made a bipartisan bill more difficult, but I have continued talks with those Republicans who are genuinely interested in a bipartisan path forward.\u201d Cardin met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday afternoon. Cardin departed Schumer\u2019s office without a clear resolution in sight, but he vowed to continue working\u00a0with Risch and other Republicans to find a bipartisan solution to the standoff and that would get the support of President Joe Biden. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get to the finish line, we\u2019re going to need a bipartisan bill,\u201d he said. \u201cSen. Risch and I have a good relationship and we will continue that. I\u2019ve heard this before,\u201d he added about Risch\u2019s concerns.\u00a0\u201dIt\u2019s not something new.\u00a0We work well together.\u201d Risch posted of X that he looks forward to the ICC legislation being on the agenda of the committee\u2019s next meeting.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-charges", "text": "The federal judge overseeing the federal criminal classified documents case against Donald Trump and his two co-defendants in Florida has denied efforts to dismiss nearly 10 of the 41 charges in the indictment against them on several technical issues. District Judge Aileen Cannon did, however, agree with the defendants that some of the language in the indictment was \u201clegally unnecessary\u201d and ruled that one of the paragraphs would be removed from the indictment. In the small win for the defense, Cannon rejected prosecutors\u2019 rationale for including a paragraph in the charges that laid out an episode in which Trump allegedly showed an unnamed representative of his political organization a classified map and commented that he should not be showing the map to the individual. Prosecutors had pointed to a procedural rule that allows the admission of evidence that relates to uncharged conduct. However, Cannon said Monday that such evidence should be subjected to certain pretrial litigation before it is allowed to come into a case. In explaining that narrow ruling, she took swipes at the prosecutors for their use of a so-called speaking indictment, meaning an indictment that goes beyond the sparse legal requirements for charging someone and gives a fuller narrative of the allegations. Cannon noted in her order that \u201cthe risks that can flow from a prosecutor\u2019s decision to include in a charging document an extensive narrative account of his or her view of the facts, especially in cases of significant public interest.\u201d While Trump and his co-defendants raised several other technical issues they saw with charges in the indictment, including duplicity issues, the judge ultimately found those \u201cidentified deficiencies, even if generating some arguable confusion, are either permitted by law, raise evidentiary challenges not appropriate for disposition at this juncture.\u201d Cannon also said that as long as the jury was \u201cinstructed appropriately and presented with adequate verdict forms as to each Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct\u201d there wasn\u2019t an issue.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_supreme-court-recordings-alito-wife-roberts", "text": "A left-wing activist on Monday released secret recordings of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and his wife, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, discussing a range of politically sensitive topics. In conversation with the activist,\u00a0who\u00a0represented herself as a religious conservative and did not disclose\u00a0in the recordings she released\u00a0that she was producing\u00a0them\u00a0and would make them public, Justice Alito endorses her suggestion that \u201cpeople in this country who believe in God have got to keep fighting for that \u2013 to return our country to a place of Godliness.\u201d \u201cWell, I agree with you, I agree with you,\u201d Alito says. At another point, the activist represents herself as a devout Catholic, telling the justice, \u201cI don\u2019t know that we can negotiate with the left in the way that, like, needs to happen for the polarization to end. I think that it\u2019s a matter of, like, winning.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re probably right,\u201d Alito responds. \u201cOn one side or the other \u2014 one side or the other is going to win. I don\u2019t know. I mean, there can be a way of working, \u00a0a way of living together peacefully, but it\u2019s difficult, you know, because there are differences on fundamental things that really can\u2019t be compromised. They really can\u2019t be compromised. So, it\u2019s not like you are going to split the difference.\u201d\u00a0 The recordings were made by Lauren Windsor, a self-described documentary filmmaker who said she made the recordings during a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society last week.\u00a0The subjects appear to be unaware that they were being recorded by Windsor, who called the clips \u201cundercover audio\u201d on X. Rolling Stone first reported on the recordings. During last week\u2019s event, Windsor also secretly recorded a conservation she had with Chief Justice John Roberts. In that exchange, the chief can be heard on tape rebuffing some of Windsor\u2019s comments, including her position that the Supreme Court should be \u201cguiding\u201d the US as a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know that we live in a Christian nation. I know a lot of Jewish and Muslim friends who would say maybe not,\u201d Roberts says in the recording. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not our job to do that. It\u2019s our job to decide the cases as best we can.\u201d CNN has not independently obtained the full audio of the comments made by Alito or his wife, and the portions that were posted by Windsor on X were part of a larger recording she made during the event. Alito did not respond to questions from CNN about his comments or those of his wife, Martha-Ann. Roberts also did not respond to CNN about the secret recordings. The Alitos in particular have been embroiled in recent controversy following media reporting about two provocative flags raised at the conservative jurist\u2019s properties. The incident added to a growing list of ethics controversies that has plagued the court in recent years and drawn scrutiny from politicians and pundits across the aisle. In a separate clip during which Windsor again represented herself as a religious conservative,\u00a0Martha-Ann Alito can be heard bemoaning a Washington Post style reporter who wrote critically about her, and goes on to complain about \u201cfemnazis,\u201d who she says \u201cbelieve (Justice Alito) should control\u201d her. The comment came after Windsor brought up the flag controversy, in which Justice Alito said his wife was responsible for\u00a0raising two provocative flags seen at Alito\u2019s properties,\u00a0an upside-down US flag hoisted at his home in Virginia in early 2021 and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his New Jersey home last summer. \u201cSo they\u2019ll go to hell,\u201d Martha-Ann Alito says in the recording. \u201cHe never controls me.\u201d Later in her conversation with Windsor, Martha-Ann Alito says she wants to\u00a0raise \u201ca Sacred Heart of Jesus flag because I have to look across the lagoon at the Pride flag for the next month.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, please don\u2019t put up a flag,\u2019\u201d she said\u00a0in apparent reference to the justice. \u201cI said, \u2018I won\u2019t do it, because I\u2019m deferring to you. But when you are free of this nonsense, I\u2019m putting it up and I\u2019m going to send them a message every day, maybe every week I\u2019ll be changing the flags.\u2019\u201d At another point during their conversation, Windsor says that Martha-Ann Alito\u2019s critics are \u201cpersecuting\u201d her and that she\u2019s serving as a \u201cconvenient stand-in for anybody who\u2019s religious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m German. I\u2019m German. My heritage is German. You come after me, I\u2019m going to give it back to you,\u201d Martha-Ann Alito said. \u201cAnd there will be a way. It doesn\u2019t have to be now. But there will be a way \u2013 they will know.\u201d James Duff, the executive director of the Supreme Court Historical Society, slammed the recordings in a statement on\u00a0Monday. \u201cWe condemn the surreptitious recording of Justices at the event, which is inconsistent with the entire spirit of the evening,\u201d Duff said. \u201cAttendees are advised that discussion of current cases, cases decided by current sitting Justices, or a Justice\u2019s jurisprudence is strictly prohibited and may result in forfeiture of membership in the Society.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/supreme-court-recordings-alito-wife-roberts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_us-intelligence-sinwar-gaza", "text": "American intelligence officials believe that Yahya Sinwar, the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza who is thought to be the group\u2019s key decision-maker on any potential ceasefire deal, likely believes the group can survive Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy it and feels confident it is well-positioned to approach negotiations from a place of strength, according to US officials familiar with recent assessments. The goal for Hamas is to survive, these sources say \u2014\u00a0that would be victory for\u00a0the group. Sinwar likely believes\u00a0Hamas\u00a0can hold out while Israel\u2019s global standing deteriorates as the war in Gaza, which\u00a0has killed thousands of civilians,\u00a0continues. A senior Biden administration official put it bluntly: \u201cHe believes he\u2019s winning. For US negotiators pursuing a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, it\u2019s a discouraging assessment. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the families of American hostages being held in Gaza in a meeting in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning that the fate of the latest proposal rests with Sinwar. While the US is pressuring those who have sway over Hamas to push the group to accept the deal, Blinken on Tuesday made it clear that the US believes that Sinwar is the ultimate decision-maker. \u201cI think there are those who have influenced, but influence is one thing, actually getting a decision made is the is another thing. I don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza are actually the ones who can make decisions,\u201d Blinken said, adding: \u201cThat is what we are waiting on.\u201d If Sinwar believes the group can\u00a0hold out against the Israeli invasion, it would mean he doesn\u2019t yet feel sufficient pressure to reach\u00a0an\u00a0agreement that would end the fighting \u2014\u00a0even as Palestinian civilians continue to perish. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Sinwar called their deaths \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d in messages reviewed by the paper. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0told Hamas\u2019 political leadership in the Gulf state of Qatar recently, according to one of the messages. The date of the message isn\u2019t clear but suggests that\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0is pressing for the conflict to continue. US officials have sought publicly to portray Sinwar as callous to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and interested only in preserving his own personal survival. \u201cIt should come as a shock to no one that Mr. Sinwar cares nothing at all about the lives of innocent Palestinians that have been caught up in this war, a war he started.And it should surprise and shock no one that a beast like Mr. Sinwar would actually take glee in it and see advantage in it,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told\u00a0reporters on Tuesday. Sinwar, who was one of the key planners of the October 7 attack, has remained at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, officials believe. The US intelligence community has struggled to track him, according to one source familiar with the intelligence. But he has continued to drive Hamas\u2019 negotiation positions, and it can often take days for messages to reach him, slowing the process. Both Sinwar and Hamas\u2019 top military official, Mohammed Deif, are still alive. Even\u00a0if Israel has killed 15,000 Hamas militants, as\u00a0it claims, it means that as much as half of the group\u2019s estimated fighting force is still on the battlefield. A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas\u2019 military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group\u2019s civilian and political leader. He was elected to\u00a0Hamas\u2019 main\u00a0decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017\u00a0as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza. However,\u00a0he has since\u00a0become\u00a0the Politburo\u2019s de facto leader, according to\u00a0research by the European Council on Foreign Relations. Regional polling \u2014\u00a0while flawed \u2014\u00a0has indicated that Hamas had grown unpopular in Gaza before the October 7 attack, and some analysts have suggested that the group may have launched the operation in part to try to gin up some domestic support. Blinken said Hamas\u2019 answer to the proposal will reveal the group\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe await the answer from Hamas and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they\u2019re looking for, who they\u2019re looking after,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAre they looking after one guy who may be for now safe \u2026 while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what\u2019s necessary to actually move this to a better place, to help end the suffering of people to help bring real security to Israelis and Palestinians alike?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/us-intelligence-sinwar-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Killing a person after birth is illegal in every state. \u201cEvery state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no basis for this claim,\u201d Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: \u201cThe falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.\u201d There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified \u201cother places.\u201d But he was wrong then, too: New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though false social media posts claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator\u2019s 2022 bill that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was revised before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee acknowledged that the early text\u2019s vague use of the phrase \u201cperinatal death\u201d might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom clarified that the \u201cperinatal death\u201d immunity is specifically for \u201cperinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.\u201d In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the false claim that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: \u201cI say, let the states decide. This is \u2014 every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN.  \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d Maya Manian, an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned,\u00a0said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The interview was uneventful and lasted less than thirty minutes,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cThe President and his team will continue to fight the lawless Manhattan DA Witch Hunt.\u201d The interview took place around 3:30 p.m. Monday, a second source told CNN. Trump answered all questions in the virtual interview and was described as polite, respectful and accommodating to the probation officers, according to a New York City official familiar with the interview. Juanita Holmes, commissioner for the New York City Department of Probation, was present, along with the general counsel for the department and the officer assigned to Trump\u2019s case, the source said. Trump attorney Todd Blanche was also present for the meeting. It is not standard for anyone other than the assigned officer and the defendant to be present at pre-sentencing interviews. Trump, according to the source, told the officers to be safe at the end of the interview. The probation department did not rule out the possibility of a follow-up meeting, the source added. The meeting forms part of the report the probation department will submit to Judge Juan Merchan to help decide Trump\u2019s punishment ahead of his sentencing, set for\u00a010 a.m.\u00a0on\u00a0July 11. Merchan could sentence the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. In a pre-sentencing interview, a defendant is typically asked about their conviction and other basic background information such as their employment and criminal history. Defendants do not have to cooperate with the routine pre-sentencing investigation, but a judge can take a negative inference from a defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation. As part of the process, Trump\u2019s legal team can submit letters of support from his friends and family to Merchan. The former president\u2019s team is scheduled to submit its sentencing recommendation Thursday, according to a source familiar with the plan. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office will also submit a memo telling the judge what sentence it sees fit for Trump. A Manhattan jury last month found Trump guilty of all 34 charges in his hush money trial, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. He was accused of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-leader-testifies-congress-invs", "text": "Senators blasted the head of the US Coast Guard at a contentious hearing on Tuesday, saying she has fostered a \u201cculture of concealment,\u201d withheld critical information from congressional investigators and failed to hold leaders and perpetrators accountable for serious misconduct. \u201cOur investigation has shown a deep moral rot within the Coast Guard now,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, chair of the Homeland Security Committee\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has been looking into the Coast Guard\u2019s past mishandling of sexual assault cases. \u201cOne that prioritizes cronyism over accountability, silence over survivors.\u201d Blumenthal and other lawmakers from the subcommittee told Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan that their investigation has found that sexual assault remains a \u201cpersistent and unacceptably prevalent\u201d issue across the service, despite her initial assurances that it was a problem of the past. Nearly 40 whistleblowers have come forward to the subcommittee in recent months, lawmakers said. At the hearing, Fagan was questioned about what specific steps she was taking to ensure those who commit serious misconduct, as well as those who cover up their crimes, are removed from the service. \u201cAre you aware that there are more survivors who leave the Coast Guard than perpetrators?\u201d asked Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is based. \u201cThis problem is not one of the past. It is real and present \u2026 and the evidence is not in my voice, it is the voices and faces of the whistleblowers \u2026 they are in my view heroes in this story.\u201d The hearing was sparked by CNN\u2019s reporting on the results of a secret investigation \u2014 dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which was quietly closed and hidden from Congress and the public despite substantiating dozens of sexual assaults that had previously been mishandled at the Coast Guard\u2019s prestigious academy. At a previous hearing led by the same subcommittee, four sexual assault victims testified about how they were silenced, retaliated against and left battling severe mental trauma while alleged perpetrators continued to thrive within the service. \u201cWe are taking action, the work is not done \u2026 we have not waited,\u201d Fagan said, repeatedly pledging to change the culture but saying she needs more time and resources to do so. \u201cI want to stop creating victims, but for the victims that we do have in the organization, I am 100% committed to fully supporting them and their needs.\u201d Fagan had previously said she only learned of the \u201ctotality\u201d of the so-called Fouled Anchor probe when CNN inquired about the issue, though she had heard of it because she had previously taken steps to remove a commanding officer caught up in the investigation. When pressed by senators Tuesday on how much she had known about the investigation prior to becoming commandant in 2021, she acknowledged that she had \u201cformally\u201d learned about it when the agency\u2019s leadership council was briefed in 2018,and she said that \u201cwhen we closed it out in 2020, there was conversation around whether to disclose or not.\u201d Fagan refused to say whether she believed her predecessor, Admiral Karl Schultz, was behind the ultimate decision to keep the findings of Fouled Anchor from Congress after the probe concluded. She said she did not have \u201cany direct evidence of misconduct\u201d surrounding this decision, even though minutes earlier senators had displayed a giant poster of a handwritten list made by Schultz\u2019s second in command with \u201cpros\u201d and \u201ccons\u201d about whether to be transparent with lawmakers and the public about the probe. Schultz previously declined to comment to CNN about Fouled Anchor. The hearing Tuesday came as Fagan was already facing immense pressure, as new controversies and increased congressional scrutiny have shined a light on how sexual assault is continuing to plague the agency. This includes explosive allegations from the academy\u2019s longtime head of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, who recently announced her resignation and said top leaders had directed her to lie to sexual assault victims and Congress, making her an unwitting accomplice in the Fouled Anchor coverup. Several lawmakers seized on Norenberg\u2019s allegations, specifically that she had been barred from providing survivors with key paperwork that would help them access veteran\u2019s benefits available to sexual assault survivors. Fagan said she couldn\u2019t speak about specifics of that allegation, as well as other issues raised by the senators, because of an open Inspector General investigation. That prompted Blumenthal to criticize her for using the investigation as a shield, eliciting applause from the audience. \u201cYou\u2019re the leader, these decisions are yours,\u201d said Blumenthal. Fagan said she hadn\u2019t actually read Norenberg\u2019s full statement, just the CNN article about it. Senators also focused on an email alleging a recent assault coverup that went viral after being deleted from Coast Guard servers and a leaked internal memo showing that Coast Guard officials recently worried that publishing testimonials from assault survivors \u201ccould continue to exacerbate the narrative \u2026 that the Coast Guard is in a sexual assault crisis now.\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, argued that the \u201creluctance\u201d to release the videos \u201cindicates a real failure of leadership\u201d and lack of understanding of the agency\u2019s current sexual assault problem. Throughout the hearing, lawmakers pressed Fagan on what they described as a lack of transparency and cooperation with their investigation. \u201cThe only way you can change the culture, the only way this can be fixed \u2026 is with truth, transparency and accountability,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin and Ranking Member of the subcommittee, adding that he thinks subpoenas will be necessary. Johnson flipped through page after page of records produced by the Coast Guard that were almost entirely redacted. A group of bipartisan lawmakers from the House Oversight committee, who were not part of the hearing but have their own investigation underway into the agency\u2019s handling of a variety of misconduct, including sexual assault, racism and hazing, joined the voices of criticism. They sent a letter to Fagan on Tuesday saying that the Coast Guard has provided fewer than 1% of records identified as potentially responsive to the requests to date. They also said they have heard from whistleblowers who \u201crevealed additional cultural deficiencies and alleged incompetence and misconduct by current and former leaders,\u201d who whistleblowers say may have \u201cwillfully concealed evidence relevant to criminal investigations\u201d and \u201cmisrepresented material facts to Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) investigators to conceal the depth of the culture of misconduct and the identities of other potential suspects.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Fagan said the Coast Guard has been fully cooperating with the subcommittee\u2019s investigation. But senators said it appeared that the records it deemed \u201csensitive\u201d and refused to provide were more likely withheld because of fear of further public embarrassment. \u201cWhat\u2019s required of the Coast Guard at this moment is an unsparing commitment to truth-telling, following the facts and the evidence wherever they lead, even if they are embarrassing to former members of the Coast Guard or present members,\u201d said Blumenthal.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}

On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_biden-family-trial", "text": "As President Joe Biden engages in the fight of his political life in a campaign focused on democracy and the rule of law, the most intimate details of his family\u2019s ongoing personal tragedies have been publicly dissected in a courtroom over the last week. Hunter Biden\u2019s struggles with addiction after the death of\u00a0his brother\u00a0Beau Biden have been the focus of hours of testimony during his trial for federal criminal charges, putting some of the Biden family\u2019s most personal problems on full display. The president\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts connected to a gun he purchased in October 2018. For decades, the president has navigated the sometimes-competing demands of his political career and being a father, particularly when it comes to Hunter Biden.\u00a0Part of the president\u2019s enduring brand has been his ability to relate to the personal tragedies of others because of what his family has suffered, including the death of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car crash that severely injured Beau and Hunter, and Beau\u2019s 2015 death from brain cancer. The effect Beau Biden\u2019s death had on his younger brother has been a focus\u00a0in court.\u00a0At issue in the case is whether Hunter Biden lied when he asserted he wasn\u2019t an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d drugs\u00a0on a form\u00a0when he purchased a revolver\u00a0in October 2018.\u00a0Jury deliberations began Monday afternoon. In the government\u2019s opening arguments, prosecutor Derek Hines argued \u201cno one is above the law\u201d regardless of their family name,\u00a0echoing the Biden campaign\u2019s\u00a0response to Trump\u2019s guilty verdict\u00a0last month. To convince the jury that Hunter Biden was actively using drugs around October 2018, prosecutors laid bare the broken relationships and desperate measures he took to access drugs, through testimony of people close to him and, at times, with his own words.\u00a0Prosecutors have also showed the laptop Hunter Biden left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019 \u2013 infamously at the center of many GOP attacks on the president and his son \u2013 and have used text messages pulled from the computer to make the case that Hunter was using drugs when he bought the gun. On the first day of testimony, prosecutors played clips from the audiobook recording of Hunter\u2019s 2021 memoir \u201cBeautiful Things.\u201d For nearly an hour, jurors, several of whom had lost loved ones to addiction, listened as Hunter described the depths of his addiction, from being ripped off by fellow drug addicts to roaming homeless encampments in Los Angeles to buy crack. The most emotional parts of the trial involved the testimony from those closest to Hunter Biden, including his daughter Naomi, his ex-girlfriend and his brother\u2019s widow Hallie Biden and his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle. Though the questions they faced were aimed at determining whether Hunter was using drugs in 2018, the effect Hunter\u2019s drug use had on their own lives was inescapable. On the third day of the trial, prosecutors called Buhle, who was married to Hunter for more than two decades until their divorce was finalized in 2017, to the stand. She testified about drugs and paraphernalia she found in Hunter\u2019s car multiple times, including in 2018, when she would check it before their daughters used the vehicle. Buhle, who was ordered to testify under a subpoena, told the court that she learned of Hunter Biden\u2019s drug use in 2015. He moved out of their home after she discovered a crack pipe, but the couple didn\u2019t officially separate until she learned of his infidelity. The two did not interact while she was in the courtroom. Hallie Biden, who was dating Hunter Biden at the time he bought the gun, was another key witness for the prosecution. The two grew close in the wake of Beau Biden\u2019s death and publicly announced their relationship in March 2017. President Biden said in a statement on behalf of himself and his wife that Hunter and Hallie had their \u201cfull and complete support and we are happy for them.\u201d Their complicated on-and-off again relationship is at the center of the charges. Hallie Biden took the gun Hunter Biden is accused of illegally possessing out of his car and tossed it in a dumpster near a Wilmington, Delaware, grocery store. She testified that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack in 2018 and she abused the drug until quitting in August 2018. She said that she encouraged him to get sober. \u201cIt was a terrible experience that I went through,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, and I\u2019m ashamed and I regret that period of my life.\u201d Critically, she testified that on October 23, she found the gun and drugs as she cleaned out Hunter Biden\u2019s truck. Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, stressed the importance of his client\u2019s frame of mind when he made the purchase and whether he \u201cknowingly\u201d violated the law when he bought the gun. Lowell connected Hunter\u2019s addiction to the string of tragedies that have defined him and the family for decades, including the accident that killed his mother and sister. If Hallie Biden was the prosecution\u2019s star witness, the defense hoped that Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s daughter, would help blunt the impact of her testimony. Naomi Biden described a visit she took to see her father in the summer of 2018 while he was in rehab in Los Angeles after not seeing him \u201cin a really long time,\u201d she said. She brought her partner, now husband, to meet him. \u201cHe seemed like the clearest he had been since my uncle died,\u201d she told the court. \u201cHe seemed really great.\u201d Naomi Biden\u00a0also\u00a0testified that she didn\u2019t see evidence of drug use in her father\u2019s car when she borrowed it in October 2018. She said he seemed clear headed when they met up and she was \u201chopeful\u201d about his sobriety efforts. Prosecutors, however, confronted Naomi with a series of texts from the time, when Hunter Biden seemed difficult to reach. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad I can\u2019t take this,\u201d she texted her father, adding that she just wanted to \u201chang out with you.\u201d After her testimony, Naomi Biden was seen wiping away tears as she left the courtroom. For many, both inside and outside the courtroom, Hunter\u2019s struggles with addiction and the toll it has taken on the family were deeply familiar. Several of the jurors said they\u00a0knew people who had struggled with addiction. During jury selection, potential jurors grew emotional at times as they described relatives who had struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and tried to get sober.\u00a0One said her parents\u2019 alcohol addiction would help her understand Hunter\u2019s case better. Another, who prosecutors objected to, said his daughter is a recovering addict and \u201ceveryone deserves a second chance.\u201d Weathering adversity together has become part of the Biden brand. The president\u00a0has not shied away from supporting Hunter Biden\u00a0over the years, even as he\u2019s faced legal troubles over his taxes and the gun charges, or as House Republicans attempt to use his son\u2019s business dealings against him. That family support has been on full display in court, where he has been surrounded by family members: his stepmother, first lady Dr. Jill Biden; his sister Ashley Biden; his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden; his aunt, Valerie Biden; and various longtime family friends.\u00a0President Biden wasn\u2019t in the courtroom, but made clear where he stood as the trial began. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad,\u201d Biden said in a statement at the start of the trial. \u201cOur family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d Last week, the president ruled out pardoning his son.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_takeaways-day-6-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "The jury in Hunter Biden\u2019s federal gun trial began deliberations on Monday after the defendant declined to testify in his own defense and both sides presented closing arguments in the historic case against the president\u2019s son. Special counsel David Weiss\u2019 prosecutors urged the jury to bring back three guilty verdicts because, even though the evidence was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cugly,\u201d it was also \u201coverwhelming\u201d that Biden bought and possessed a firearm while abusing drugs. Later, Biden\u2019s defense attorney argued that the prosecutors\u2019 case was similar to a \u201cmagician\u2019s trick,\u201d and accused Weiss\u2019 team of trying to inflate the evidence and win convictions based on \u201csuspicion and conjecture\u201d alone. If convicted, Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000, though first-time offenders like him rarely receive the maximum penalty. He pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Here are takeaways from Day 6 of the historic trial. \u2018No one is above the law,\u2019 prosecutors say In the first seconds of Leo Wise\u2019s closing arguments, he referenced the VIPs from the Biden family that have been filling the front row of the courtroom pews each day, often including\u00a0first lady Jill Biden, who was in attendance on Monday. \u201cThe people sitting in the gallery are not evidence,\u201d Wise said. \u201cYou may recognize some of them from the news or from the community \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d The first three rows of court were completely filled with Hunter Biden\u2019s friends and family, and a Secret Service agent could barely fit at the end of the front-row bench, with so many people trying to squeeze in. Jill Biden sat flanked by her son\u2019s wife on one side, and the first lady\u2019s daughter Ashley Biden on the other. As Wise continued, he returned to a theme that his colleague raised in opening statements: that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d Jurors, he said, shouldn\u2019t treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d Evidence was \u2018ugly\u2019 but \u2018overwhelming,\u2019 prosecutors say Wise went on to explain to the jury \u2013 which includes many people whose loved ones are struggling with addiction \u2013 why the prosecution went into so many excruciating details about the defendant\u2019s spiral into crack cocaine abuse. \u201cThe evidence was personal, it was ugly, and it was overwhelming. It was also absolutely necessary,\u201d Wise said. \u201cThere is no other way to prove the use of drugs or addiction to drugs than through the kind of evidence that you saw.\u201d He noted, accurately, that the judge\u2019s instructions don\u2019t require the Justice Department to prove that Biden used drugs on a specific day, but only that he was \u201cactively engaged\u201d in drugs around that time. Recalling key testimony from earlier witnesses, Wise highlighted Biden\u2019s ex-girlfriend who testified that she saw him smoking crack in September 2018, less than two weeks before he bought the gun. Furthermore, he pointed out that Biden\u2019s rehab stints shortly before and after buying the firearm speaks to his \u201cpattern\u201d of drug use around that time. \u201cYou could convict on those facts alone,\u201d he said. \u2018It\u2019s time to end this case,\u2019 defense says During his nearly 90-minute closing argument, defense attorney Abbe Lowell forcefully made the case that prosecutors hadn\u2019t met the high burden to prove Biden\u2019s guilt, pointing to the issue of whether he knowingly violated the law. Lowell repeatedly said that prosecutors showed no direct evidence that Biden was using illegal drugs during October 2018, when he bought the firearm, comparing their case to a slight-of-hand deception. \u201cHave you ever seen the magician\u2019s trick of having you look at this hand, while in the other hand is where the trick is being done? Look at this \u2013 and then see that in the hand that matters, there is nothing there,\u201d Lowell said, invoking a motif that he raised several times during closing arguments. In order to reach a guilty verdict, prosecutors need to prove that Biden was \u201cconscious and aware\u201d of the law and how he was violating it, Lowell argued. \u201cWith this very high burden, it\u2019s time to end this case,\u201d Lowell said. Poking holes in key witness testimony The defense attorney also said there were serious flaws with the testimony from three of Biden\u2019s exes who testified in the case. Lowell noted that Hallie Biden couldn\u2019t remember key details from the day she found Biden\u2019s firearm in his truck. Lowell also questioned the veracity of\u00a0claims from Zoe Kestan\u00a0\u2013 who met Biden at a gentleman\u2019s club where she worked \u2013 noting the immunity deal she reached with prosecutors beforehand. Lowell said Kestan met with prosecutors many times \u201cto rehearse\u201d her testimony \u2013 instantly drawing an objection from the special counsel\u2019s team. Lowell also pointed out that Kestan took many pictures of Biden with drugs when they were together, but none from the critical month when he bought the gun. Lowell also attacked the prosecutors\u2019 case as based on \u201csuspicion\u201d and \u201cconjecture,\u201d phrases that he repeated many times, perhaps hoping to sow some doubt among the jurors. \u201cThere was no actual witness to the drug use in this period of time,\u201d Lowell asserted. Clash over Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony The two sides clashed over the\u00a0testimony of Naomi Biden, who was called as a defense witness on Friday. In his closing arguments, Lowell said prosecutors were \u201cextraordinarily cruel\u201d to Biden\u2019s daughter by asking her during their cross-examination if she ever used cocaine. They posed that question while trying to establish that, because she doesn\u2019t do drugs, it was likely her father who left crack remnants in their shared truck. Lowell glared directly at prosecutors as he criticized the prosecutors, raising his voice and banging his fist on the lectern. But after he was done, prosecutors quickly shot back, telling the jury that they believed Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony actually hurt her father\u2019s defense. \u201cWho called the defendant\u2019s daughter as a witness in this case? Not us,\u201d prosecutor Derek Hines said during his rebuttal. \u201c\u2026 And you saw up there on the stand how uncomfortable she was. The anguish sitting there knowing she was testifying as a defense witness, but she had to tell the truth.\u201d He argued that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t vouch for the defendant\u2019s sobriety throughout that month of October\u201d 2018 when he bought the gun because she swore to tell the truth and could be prosecuted if she lied. Hunter Biden doesn\u2019t testify As last week\u2019s proceedings wrapped up on Friday, Lowell told the judge the defense team was still making the decision over whether their client would testify in his own defense. That would\u2019ve been an extremely risky move that could have opened the president\u2019s son up to intense and potentially expansive questioning from the special counsel prosecutors. Ultimately, however, Lowell said Monday that Biden would not testify and instructions to the jury were adjusted to make it clear they aren\u2019t allowed to hold that decision against him in their deliberations. The jury will continue its deliberations Tuesday morning.

Here\u2019s one runner\u2019s description: As a journalism student at the University of Delaware preparing for my final year of college before the real world, I jumped at the chance when one of my journalism professors sent me a text asking if I wanted to work for CNN. There\u2019s a very strict policy on electronics in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building that prohibits the usage of laptops and phones\u00a0inside. This\u00a0policy may have been a hassle, but I\u2019m ultimately grateful for it, as it\u2019s the reason I had a job during the trial. My title of runner was extremely literal (as I learned the hard way when I wore boots to the first day of the trial), meaning I was taking notes from reporters in the courtroom and delivering them to a team of producers on the ground. This is how CNN and many other media outlets maintained live updates during the trial; it was thanks to runners like me. Of course, the job wasn\u2019t easy, and I think the blisters speak for themselves, but they serve as a reminder of one of the coolest experiences of my life so far. Day after day, I was tasked with carrying notes bearing the latest national news up and down three flights of stairs, which was a tedious task when the trial was slow and an utterly invigorating one when it wasn\u2019t. My record for runs was Monday, June 10, when I traversed the\u00a0dimly lit, vaguely eerie stairs and braved security a total of 40 times. By the end of the trial, I was on first-name basis with nearly all of the security guards. It all paid off though when we finally got to the verdict, and I believe I may have sprinted faster than I ever had to get that note to our producers on the ground. If all goes according to plan, this will be far from the last court case I cover, but I would call this a pretty solid first trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/cnn-runners-hunter-biden-verdict-courthouse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_rfk-jr-coalition-challenges", "text": "In Wisconsin, a 62-year-old tree farm owner who voted for Donald Trump\u00a0in 2020 and a 22-year-old who cast her first presidential vote for Joe Biden that same year share one major thing in common now \u2013 they\u2019re both planning to vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this fall. And though neither of the Badger State residents has volunteered for a presidential campaign before, Dale Stenbroten and Katie Zimmerman spend their weekends trying to convince others to find the same inspiration in the independent candidate that they do. Stenbroten told CNN he encourages his friends to look up videos of Kennedy and listen to what he has to say. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to agree on everything he says, but the important issues are there, and he\u2019s going to deal with them,\u201d he said. They are representative of Kennedy\u2019s coalition of voters, which spans the political spectrum and has grown large enough to potentially alter the 2024 presidential race. These supporters \u2013 who say they\u2019re drawn to Kennedy because of his stances on\u00a0key issues and his rebuke of mainstream political parties \u2013 could have the greatest impact by tipping the balance in battleground states like Wisconsin, which has been decided by narrow margins in recent cycles. Stenbroten, who describes himself as an \u201cindependent-leaning conservative,\u201d didn\u2019t vote for president in 2016, but he\u00a0cast his ballot in 2020 for Trump, whom he considered the \u201cbetter of two evils.\u201d Though the choice between the two major-party candidates remains the same this year, the Cedarburg resident doesn\u2019t think Trump has the same appeal to independently minded voters this time around. \u201c\u200b\u200bHe\u2019s like a broken record, keeps saying the same thing over and over and over again, and it gets real old, real fast,\u201d Stenbroten said, expressing fatigue with the former president\u2019s fixation on the results of the 2020 election and his claims of political persecution in the legal system. Stenbroten sees a refreshing level of authenticity in Kennedy. \u201cHe brings a lot of integrity to the table. I feel that I can trust him. I can believe him,\u201d he said. For her part,\u00a0Zimmerman, a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, discovered Kennedy on YouTube and was instantly inspired. \u201cHe talked a lot about how he wanted to unite America and bring people together, instead of further divide them, and that\u2019s something that means a lot to me, personally,\u201d she said. Zimmerman said she doesn\u2019t see Biden, whom she supported in 2020, communicating with young voters like her in the same way that Kennedy does. \u201cI want to own a house in the future. \u2026 I haven\u2019t necessarily heard Biden say things like that, that appeal to me as a person or as a voter,\u201d she explained. Marco Cordero, a 22-year-old from Bayview, also cast his first presidential vote for Biden but has since soured on the Democrat, citing inflation rates and conflicts in the Middle East. \u201cI think he focuses more on the middle class,\u201d Cordero said of Kennedy, listing national debt, affordable housing and student loans as issues where the independent appeals to voters like him. It\u2019s unclear whether Kennedy\u2019s presence in the race would have a greater impact on Biden or Trump, but polling data indicates Kennedy\u2019s largest contingent of voters could be those who didn\u2019t support either candidate in 2020. A New York Times/Siena College survey from May of registered voters in six key battleground states, including Wisconsin, found Kennedy earning 10% support, trailing Trump\u2019s 40% and Biden\u2019s 33% in a survey that also included Green Party candidate Jill Stein, independent Cornel West and former Libertarian Party candidate Lars Mapstead. Of those who said they supported Kennedy, 19% said they didn\u2019t vote in the 2020 presidential election, outpacing the 8% of Kennedy backers who said they voted for Biden and the 6% who said they voted for Trump. Douglas DeNicola, a lifelong Democratic voter, thinks Kennedy is bridging the gap between the parties. \u201cThis division that we have can only be solved if one of those two men are not president, because a Biden voter will never vote for Trump and a Trump voter will never vote for Biden,\u201d he said. On a dreary\u00a0Saturday morning\u00a0in Wauwatosa, the volunteer coordinator spent more than 20 minutes engaging an ardent supporter of the former president. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even given him a chance,\u201d DeNicola told the man, urging him to check out Kennedy\u2019s campaign website. \u201cNo, because he doesn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d the Trump supporter replied. Amid the politically charged discussion, a passerby shouted at DeNicola, \u201cFix the worms in your brain,\u201d presumably referencing a medical abnormality Kennedy experienced in 2010 that he said was caused by a worm that entered his brain and then died. \u201cI\u2019d rather vote for the worm,\u201d DeNicola retorted. DeNicola told CNN later he has a hard time grasping the current polarization of politics, which he thinks serves the interests of the powerful, rather than average Americans. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how we continue to focus on these tiny things,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, 95% of people want the same thing in life.\u201d While Kennedy\u2019s outsider campaign faces long odds of winning the White House, his core supporters bristle at the attacks issued by both Democrats and Republicans that the independent is a spoiler without a clear path to victory. They\u2019re realistic about the path ahead for Kennedy but believe the candidate who best represents their values deserves their vote. \u201cChips will fall, you know, as they may and I\u2019ll accept whatever happens,\u201d Stenbroten said, before admitting it would be \u201cdisappointing\u201d if Biden won critical Wisconsin due to Kennedy drawing a portion of Trump\u2019s potential voter base. Faced with the possibility of Trump winning the election due to Kennedy voters drawing support from Biden, Zimmerman asserted, \u201cI\u2019m not OK with that.\u201d \u201cI think it might be a tight election for both of the two main parties. But again \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say that I would be OK with it,\u201d she said. Still, Zimmerman stands by her choice to back Kennedy, no matter the electoral consequences \u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily feel any guilt because I was able to have a choice in who I wanted to vote for,\u201d she said. \u2018The fact that he\u2019s different makes me want to get more invested\u2019 Many Kennedy voters see his campaign as operating from the political center, bridging divides between Democrats and Republicans. A CNN national poll released in April found 60% of Kennedy supporters identify as politically moderate, with 28% identifying as conservative compared with 12% of those identifying as liberal. A sizable contingent of Kennedy\u2019s support comes from so-called double-haters \u2013 those holding an unfavorable view of both Biden and Trump, and those who are broadly frustrated with the two-party system and see Kennedy as an outsider who can shake up Washington. Steve Constantine, who recently moved back to Wisconsin after residing in Texas for several years, said he sat out the past two presidential elections because he didn\u2019t align with the choices before him. The 36-year-old private chef said he\u2019s likely to cast a ballot for Kennedy this fall because he\u2019s attracted to the independent candidate\u2019s \u201cmiddle-ness.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not super invested into politics, to be honest with you, but the fact that he\u2019s different makes me want to get more invested,\u201d Constantine said. CNN spoke\u00a0with many Kennedy supporters who said they first became aware of him through his criticism of policies enacted by the Trump and Biden administrations in managing the Covid-19 pandemic. Some said they began following him through his anti-vaccine advocacy with Children\u2019s Health Defense, a leading spreader of misinformation about vaccines. They dismissed criticisms of his stance on vaccines and Covid-era policies by arguing Kennedy is focused on improving the nation\u2019s health. Amy Funck, a 60-year old independent from Milwaukee and a subscriber to the Children\u2019s Health Defense newsletter, said she first heard of Kennedy through the group. Unlike her vote for Biden in 2020, she said she\u2019ll be selecting Kennedy on her ballot enthusiastically this year. \u201cI think the president\u2019s main job is to defend our individual civil liberties,\u201d she said, a role that she thinks was \u201cdisregarded\u201d under pandemic-era leadership. Stenbroten said he shares Kennedy\u2019s vaccine skepticism, though he doesn\u2019t agree with all of the candidate\u2019s views. But at the end of the day, he said the controversies surrounding the issue don\u2019t concern him, because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be top of mind for most voters. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re the existential problems that are most important to our country. Like Bobby says, you\u2019re never going to agree on all the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you like vaccines or not, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a deal breaker.\u201d DeNicola also dismissed the prospect that some Americans might be dissuaded from voting for Kennedy by his vaccine views, arguing, \u201cIf you\u2019re a one-issue voter, it\u2019s hard to pick a candidate.\u201d Kennedy has also attracted support by staking out a firm stance against US involvement in foreign wars and has repeatedly called for the US to discontinue aiding Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion. While he continues to back US support for Israel, some Kennedy voters view his anti-war rhetoric as a refreshing foreign policy approach compared with Biden and Trump. Stenbroten points to a desire to end \u201cforever wars\u201d as a top issue drawing him to Kennedy, arguing that hawkish foreign policy, along with partisan infighting, contributes to a lack of freedom for everyday Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s got to stop. Otherwise, it\u2019s just going to be, you know, an oligarchy. And we\u2019re going to be in prison, not having the freedom and the choices that we should have in this country,\u201d he said, explaining, \u201call this stuff leads to more corruption.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/rfk-jr-coalition-challenges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_south-carolina-republican-primary-nancy-mace", "text": "South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace will win the Republican primary for the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, CNN projects, staving off two challengers and a push by allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom she voted to oust. By taking a majority of the vote Tuesday, Mace is projected to avoid a June 25 primary runoff in her quest for a third term representing the coastal Charleston-area seat. Tuesday\u2019s outcome comes as\u00a0a much-needed win for Mace, who has become an increasingly polarizing figure within her party. She has faced waves of criticism over the past several months, including accusations that she created a toxic workplace to anger over votes by her and seven other Republicans to boot McCarthy from the speakership in October. Days after the move, Mace wore a white T-shirt with a red \u201cA\u201d on the front, a reference to the novel \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and what she described as a demonization of her vote. McCarthy sought his revenge at the ballot box, with his allies spending millions attacking Mace during the primary. The congresswoman and groups backing her painted chief opponent Catherine Templeton \u2013 a former South Carolina Cabinet official under Republican Gov. Nikki Haley \u2013 as a McCarthy puppet. Mace has faced criticism for her evolving relationship with former President Donald Trump. After the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, Mace told CNN that Trump\u2019s \u201centire legacy was wiped out\u201d that day. In the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections, Trump backed her primary opponent Katie Arrington. Among Mace\u2019s chief backers in that primary was Haley, who campaigned with Mace and appeared in a TV ad on her behalf.\u00a0Mace went on to defeat Arrington by 8 points. Two years later, Mace endorsed Trump over Haley ahead of South Carolina\u2019s Republican presidential primary. The former president endorsed Mace in March, calling her a \u201cstrong conservative voice.\u201d Mace was first elected in 2020, when she narrowly unseated Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham. She comfortably won reelection two years later after the district was redrawn to become more favorable to the GOP. A three-judge panel concluded last year that the district\u2019s new lines amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. But the US Supreme Court upheld the new map last month, rejecting the argument that state lawmakers had impermissibly used race as a proxy to bolster the GOP\u2019s chances.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/south-carolina-republican-primary-nancy-mace/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-hunter-biden-verdict", "text": "When Hunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve for using cocaine in 2014, his father \u2014 then-Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 wrote his family a concise message of summation. \u201cTime to move on,\u201d he said in an email. For the Bidens, moving on from Hunter\u2019s issues of addiction has proved almost impossible. Even with their son now sober and living in California with his young family, the darkest days of the family\u2019s lives continue to bear consequences in ways that weigh heavily on the president. Hunter Biden\u2019s guilty verdict on three federal gun charges Tuesday punctuated \u2014 but did not end \u2014 what has been a long and difficult saga. Joe Biden, who had planned to spend Tuesday night at the White House, returned late in the day to Delaware to surround himself with members of his family, many of whom spent the last week attending the trial. Greeting him at the steps to Marine One was his son, who only five hours earlier had left the downtown courthouse newly convicted. If the family felt anguished, they did not show it \u2014 at least not in view of the cameras. Instead, the president offered his family a warm smile, hugged Hunter Biden\u2019s young son, Beau, and gave him a kiss on the forehead. Joe Biden has little precedent to follow in navigating his son\u2019s conviction. Never before has a president\u2019s immediate family member been found guilty of a crime during their father\u2019s term in office. While the emotional weight and concern are shared by his family, doing so as president is a unique burden. Aside from the last-minute trip to Delaware \u2014 first floated as a possibility late Monday night, a source familiar with the plans said, with a final decision reached Tuesday afternoon following the verdict \u2014 the president\u2019s schedule wasn\u2019t altered. He still spoke Tuesday afternoon at an event on gun violence prevention in Washington, despite the political awkwardness of the subject matter. And he is still planning to travel to Italy on Wednesday for the G7. The display of warmth on the tarmac Tuesday was in keeping with the president\u2019s approach to his son\u2019s legal predicament. Instead of pushing him away, as some wary Democrats might prefer, the president has held Hunter Biden close throughout his ordeal. From the airport, where hugs were also exchanged between Biden family members and close aides, the group traveled in separate cars to the president\u2019s home in a leafy Wilmington neighborhood to process the developments in private. It has been behind closed doors that Joe Biden and his family have mostly kept their concerns over their son\u2019s legal issues. The president has been wary of speaking about the matter publicly, and it\u2019s not a topic aides raise easily. Asked during an interview with ABC last week about the case, Biden offered only one-word answers. \u201cYes,\u201d he would accept the verdict. \u201cYes,\u201d he had ruled out a pardon. The private nature of the circumstances in the case made the very public airing of traumatic moments during last week\u2019s trial all the more difficult. Tearful moments from the president\u2019s granddaughter Naomi deeply affected many family members. And the revelation that Hallie Biden \u2014 the widow of the president\u2019s late son, Beau Biden, who later had a relationship with Hunter Biden \u2014 had herself tried crack cocaine reverberated throughout the wider Biden orbit. In a statement following the verdict, Joe Biden framed the conviction through the lens of a father, not a president. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d the president wrote. He also sought to draw an implicit but clear distinction with former President Donald Trump, who has called the judicial system \u201crigged\u201d in the wake of his own felony conviction on charges of falsifying business records. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d What role the verdict will play in November\u2019s election remains difficult to discern, although Biden\u2019s aides and even many Republicans have downplayed the prospect of voters being swayed by the legal problems of the president\u2019s son. Biden aides \u2013 upon learning of the verdict \u2013 made clear to allies that despite the historic conviction of a sitting president\u2019s son, everything would be business as usual for the campaign, two sources familiar with the campaign\u2019s thinking said. Even as Hunter Biden\u2019s trial got underway, officials inside the president\u2019s campaign headquarters in Wilmington maintained that voters understand what they see as a black-and-white difference between Trump, who is a former president and now a convicted felon, and Hunter Biden, who \u2013 despite being the president\u2019s son \u2013 is a private citizen. One of the two sources said officials in Wilmington unsurprisingly discussed the guilty verdict, but the source declined to describe the tenor of those conversations. That reticence was a clear reflection of a reality that Biden allies know well: Few issues are more sensitive inside the White House and the president\u2019s reelection campaign operation than those related to his family. Perhaps more worrying than the political fallout, at least for some people close to Biden, is the personal toll the verdict could have on the president as he gears up for a bruising rematch against Trump. Biden, who speaks or texts with his son on a daily basis, has been concerned for his well-being throughout the legal saga. The president is still expected to spend ample time in the coming weeks preparing for his June 27 debate with Trump. And a day after one of the most painful moments for his family, Biden is expected to leave for a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The fluke of scheduling speaks to the balance Biden has been forced to strike throughout his son\u2019s legal proceedings. As the trial was underway last week, Biden was in France commemorating D-Day. Aides said the president was keeping track of the trial from overseas, and remained in touch with his son and first lady Jill Biden, who was a regular presence in the courtroom, along with their daughter Ashley, the president\u2019s brother James, and the first lady\u2019s sister Bonny Jacobs. Before and after that trip, the president spent a sizable amount of time with Hunter Biden in Delaware, including at the family beach home in Rehoboth the weekend before jury selection. He returned from France directly to the family home in Wilmington. That city rests at the very center of the Biden family identity. The train station the president passed through thousands of times as a senator and vice president is now named in his honor. The courthouse where the trial unfolded is named for the Republican senator Biden defeated in 1972. The president\u2019s reelection campaign is headquartered a few blocks away. Farther out of town is the home on a lake the Biden family has returned to in moments of joy and times of pain. The driveway out front is where, in the depths of Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, his father once chased his son after an attempted intervention, grabbed him close in the dark and cried. It is there the family retreated on Tuesday as they begin to work through the next chapter.

{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_biden-trump-democracy-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is in Europe, warning of totalitarian evil and the dangers to democracy. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is back home, seeking a favor from Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, mulling revenge and trashing US elections. The former president is making his 2024 opponent\u2019s case \u2014 that the West is being challenged by unprecedented threats to the rule of law from hostile forces outside and in. But Trump\u2019s strength also suggests that the centerpiece of Biden\u2019s trip \u2014 an homage on Friday in Normandy to one of former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s greatest speeches \u2014 may fall on many deaf ears back in America. The former president is showing in every speech and public appearance that the seduction of demagoguery, the demonization of outsiders and the language of extremism is as potent now as it was before World War II. The 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day invasion that led to the liberation of Europe have turned into a rallying point for Western leaders warning that the darkest forces of political extremism are awakening. They have also used their meetings and speeches to draw parallels between Putin\u2019s vicious assault on Ukraine and Adolf Hitler\u2019s blitzkrieg. There\u2019s nothing new in a modern US president traveling to Europe to invoke the shared history of victory over tyranny. But no other commander in chief has done so after his predecessor tried to destroy democracy to stay in office. The possibility that Biden could lose reelection \u2014 and the threat of a return to the chaos Trump inflicted on European allies \u2014 has cast an ominous shadow over the trip. On Friday, Biden will send an unmistakable message by co-opting the legacy of Reagan \u2014 one of the greatest Republican presidents \u2014 to suggest that his rival is an affront to US and GOP values. In 1984, atop a cliff stormed by US Army Rangers on June 6, 1944, known as the Pointe du Hoc, the 40th president denounced US isolationism. He also invoked the war against Nazism to summon the West to a renewed and ultimately successful Cold War struggle against another form of extremism \u2014 Kremlin-style communism. Biden will imply that Trump, with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, attacks on the integrity of the free and fair 2020 election and use of extreme anti-immigrant rhetoric that echoes that of the Nazis, is summoning the same forces that triggered global war. Can the Gipper win one for Biden? Biden, who will almost certainly be the last US president to have been born during World War II, is asking Americans to muster the same commitment to democratic values as the greatest generation whose last representatives are now slipping away. \u201cIn memory of those who fought here, died here, literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice,\u201d Biden said Thursday, surrounded by the graves of more than 9,000 Americans. \u201cLet us be the generation that when history is written about our time \u2014 in 10, 20, 30, 50, 80 years from now \u2014 it will be said: \u2018When the moment came, we met the moment. We stood strong. Our alliances were made stronger.\u00a0And we saved democracy in our time as well.\u2019\u201d That a president should have to make such an argument shows how the political climate has shifted since Reagan stood on the same spot 40 years ago and filled many eyes with tears by turning to veterans and saying, \u201cThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who scaled the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped win a war.\u201d Back then, the GOP was an internationalist, pro-democracy party. It proudly boasted about how Reagan won the Cold War until Trump mixed his cocktail of isolationism and populism that looks more kindly on Putin than US allies. It is that defining shift in outlook that may mean that Biden\u2019s speech is an effective piece of political theater but has limited political appeal. The White House and the Biden campaign won\u2019t expect that invoking the spirit of the Gipper will dent Trump\u2019s lock on Republican base voters. But the president is seeking to win over disaffected national security Republicans nostalgic for the days when a hawkish foreign policy was seen as one leg of the fabled conservative policy stool. And he\u2019s especially seeking to attract some of the tens of thousands of Republicans who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the party\u2019s primary long after she suspended her campaign. The former United Nations ambassador under Trump might have endorsed her former boss and accused Biden of weakness on the global stage. But she\u2019s far more aligned with the current president\u2019s global outlook and disdain for dictators than she is with Trump\u2019s brand of strongman appeasement. Trump back on the trail Biden\u2019s visit to Europe has coincided with his predecessor\u2019s return to the campaign trail following his felony conviction last week in a hush money trial in New York. Trump chose the moment to issue his latest opening to Putin, an accused war criminal before whom he genuflected while president. The presumptive GOP nominee insisted that he\u2019d be able to free an imprisoned American reporter. \u201cEvan Gershkovich, the reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is being held by Russia, will be released almost immediately after the election,\u201d Trump said in a video posted on Truth Social on Tuesday. \u201cBut definitely before I assume office, he will be home, he will be safe. Vladimir Putin, President of Russia will do that for me \u2026 and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll do it for anyone else.\u201d This was far from the first time that Trump has sought to demonstrate special influence with Putin. After all, he once said in a news conference in Helsinki that he believed the Russian leader, who was standing beside him, rather than the US intelligence agencies he led, on the question of Kremlin election interference. Trump\u2019s politicization of the Gershkovich case was notable since it comes after months of quiet US government efforts to free the reporter and another imprisoned American, former Marine Paul Whelan. It raises the possibility that the Russians may simply manipulate any negotiations in the assumption that Trump may give them a better deal or that the Biden administration may be prepared to pay a higher price before the election. If the Kremlin eventually did free the reporter to Trump, it could be a coup for him and would ensure he is in Moscow\u2019s debt. Trump\u2019s outreach to Putin comes at a time when the Russian president is ostracized from the international community over the barbaric assaults on civilians in Ukraine and as he imposes the greatest threat to the integrity of continental Europe since the war that Biden flew across the Atlantic to commemorate. Using the plight of an American in the ruthless Russian penal system to score political points is also one of the more cynical modern campaign gambits. Russia shrugged off Trump\u2019s remarks on Thursday, saying that the release of Gershkovich would only happen as a result of reciprocity. After Trump played nice to Putin, the sitting president went out of his way to denounce the Russian leader, who was not invited to the D-Day events despite the Soviet Union\u2019s decisive role in the defeat of Nazism. \u201cHe\u2019s not a decent man \u2014 he\u2019s a dictator, and he\u2019s struggling to make sure he holds his country together while still keeping this assault going,\u201d Biden told ABC News in an interview. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was there instead. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s first campaign event as a felon on Thursday illustrated why the election could be so close. He was before a self-selecting crowd of supporters at a Turning Point Action Town Hall and spelled out a demagogic appeal that is effective with Republican base voters. He renewed his falsehoods about fraud in the last election, insisting he planned to win a mandate in November that was \u201ctoo big to rig.\u201d He attacked the legal system following his conviction by a jury of his peers, baselessly insisting that the verdict was \u201crigged.\u201d And in the border state of Arizona, he fired off searing anti-immigrant rhetoric, much of which was alarmist and false about the crisis on the border but that may prove an effective counterpoint to Biden\u2019s attempt this week to ease his exposure on the issue by massively curtailing asylum claims. The former president has consistently refused to guarantee he will accept the result of November\u2019s election. And several times this week, he has also implied that he would use presidential power to prosecute his political opponents, threatening a fresh assault on the rule of law. \u201cWell revenge does take time, I will say that, and sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest,\u201d Trump said during an interview with \u201cDr. Phil Primetime\u201d that aired Thursday. \u201cYou know, sometimes it can.\u201d At the Thursday town hall, the former president marveled at the fact that many of his questions, from an albeit friendly crowd, were about the high cost of living, the struggle of Arizonans to buy groceries and their perception that they are unsafe because of out-of-control arrivals of undocumented migrants at the border. This may be the decisive election equation in a nutshell: Trump will wield economic and immigration issues to counter Biden\u2019s warnings that his rival\u2019s anti-democratic and autocratic leanings make him unfit to be president again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/biden-trump-democracy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_kamala-harris-byron-donalds", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview published Monday, criticized a suggestion made last week by Republican Rep. Byron Donalds that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Politico reports that the vice president called up the outlet to weigh in on former President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will pick a running mate at next month\u2019s Republican convention. She mostly withheld comment on individual prospects, Politico said, though she did pointedly criticize Donalds, who is among those considered a potential running mate for Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s sadly yet another example of somebody out of Florida trying to erase or rewrite our true history,\u201d Harris said, referring to the state\u2019s interventions under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis into Black history curriculums. \u201cI went to Florida last July to call out what they were trying to do to replace our history with lies. And apparently there\u2019s a never ending flow of that coming out of that state.\u201d Donalds\u2019 comments,\u00a0which come as Trump\u2019s campaign seeks to make inroads with non-White voters,\u00a0were made at\u00a0an event in Philadelphia with\u00a0Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, another Black Republican supporter of the former president. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said at the event last week, the\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer reported. \u201cDuring Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative \u2014 because Black people have always been conservative-minded \u2014 but more Black people voted conservatively,\u201d he said. In the interview with Politico, the vice president contrasted the Biden administration\u2019s position on abortion with those of the prospective GOP vice presidential nominees. \u201cEveryone on that list has supported a Trump abortion ban in their state or has called for a national ban. \u2026 In fact, many\u00a0voted this week in the Senate\u00a0against the right to contraception. That\u2019s how far down the road they are,\u201d said Harris, who has led the White House\u2019s messaging campaign in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2022 to overturn the federal right to an abortion. As vice president, Harris has previously waded into culture war issues,\u00a0traveling to Florida last year to slam Florida Republicans\u00a0after the state Board of Education revised standards for teaching Black history. During the visit last July, Harris highlighted standards that, according to a document posted to the state\u2019s Department of Education website, require instruction for middle schoolers to include \u201chow slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\u201d \u201cWe know the history. And let us not let these politicians who are trying to divide our country win\u201d Harris said at the time. \u201cThey are creating these unnecessary debates. This is unnecessary to debate whether enslaved people benefited from slavery. Are you kidding me? Are we supposed to debate that?\u201d The vice president has often served as the administration\u2019s messenger on an array of hot-button issues. Last month she was deployed to Jacksonville, Florida,\u00a0just hours after a controversial ban\u00a0on most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy went into effect in the state, ratcheting up the Biden campaign\u2019s message\u00a0blaming Trump for strict abortion restrictions being adopted across the country in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. In April, she traveled to Tucson just days after a state Supreme Court ruling upholding a Civil War-era ban on abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/kamala-harris-byron-donalds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial-verdict", "text": "A federal jury has convicted Hunter Biden on all three federal felony gun charges he faced, concluding that he violated laws meant to prevent drug addicts from owning firearms. The conviction marks the first time a president\u2019s immediate family member has been found guilty of a crime during their father\u2019s term in office, though his crimes predate Joe Biden\u2019s tenure as president. The jury, which deliberated for just under three hours, returned guilty verdicts on\u00a0all three charges, which stemmed from a revolver\u00a0Hunter Biden bought in October 2018 at a Delaware gun shop. The first two counts were for lying about his drug use on a federal background check form, and the third count was for possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000 at sentencing, though he likely will receive far less than the maximum as a first-time offender. Before dismissing the parties, the judge told them sentencing is usually set for 120 days following a verdict, which means it is likely to happen before Election Day. Special counsel David Weiss told reporters that the conviction was about the \u201cillegal choices the defendant made while in the throes of addiction,\u201d as he stressed that \u201cno one in this country is above the law.\u201d In a statement, Hunter Biden said he was \u201cdisappointed by the outcome\u201d but heartened by support from his family. \u201cI am more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from Melissa, my family, my friends, and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome,\u201d Hunter Biden said.\u00a0\u201cRecovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time.\u201d In a statement, President Biden said he will \u201caccept the outcome of this case\u201d and pledged support for his son. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad,\u201d the president said. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d Concludes painful chapter for Biden family The outcome ends a painful chapter for the Biden family, including many members who were directly involved in the courtroom drama. Hunter Biden was in the defendant\u2019s seat; many members of the family, including first lady Jill Biden, were often in the courtroom showing support, and a few were called to testify. The first lady arrived at the courthouse shortly after the verdict was read. She stared immediately ahead and did not move her gaze away. After court ended, Hunter Biden turned to his legal team and flashed a brief smile, perhaps stunned by the outcome, before hugging all of his attorneys and patting them on the back. As he exited, Hunter Biden gave kisses and hugs to family members and friends in the courtroom, almost like a receiving line. His friend and financial backer Kevin Morris walked out with his arms crossed. Some of the supporters looked stunned. Valerie Biden, President Biden\u2019s sister, entered the courtroom a few minutes after the verdict was read. Leaving the courthouse after the verdict, Hunter Biden shuffled his family members into an elevator as he held hands with his wife. He smiled briefly and left. The trial has unfolded against the backdrop of President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump, who himself was convicted of a felony last month in his New York hush money trial. Reacting to Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction on Tuesday, the Trump campaign initially wished him \u201cwell in his recovery and legal affairs\u201d before striking that sentiment in a later version of a statement. It also called the proceedings a \u201cdistraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family,\u201d falsely claiming that the president raked in \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in overseas dealings, though there is no evidence Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son\u2019s business dealings abroad. President has ruled out pardon Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction comes after a long-running Justice Department investigation that began in 2018, and it raises the stakes for his second scheduled trial, slated to begin in September,\u00a0on federal tax offenses. Both cases have been overseen by Weiss, who was previously the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. The guilty verdicts in the gun case are a major vindication for Weiss\u2019 team of prosecutors, who have vehemently denied allegations from Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers that the cases are politically motivated. The historic trial almost never happened. Both sides went before the judge last July with a\u00a0negotiated agreement\u00a0to resolve the gun case and have Hunter Biden plead guilty to two separate tax misdemeanors. But the judge, Maryellen Noreika,\u00a0refused to approve\u00a0the deal after a whirlwind plea hearing in which the finer points of the arrangement\u00a0crumbled under scrutiny. President Biden and the White House have repeatedly ruled out a pardon for his son. The weeklong gun trial featured intensely personal and gut-wrenching testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s well-known struggles with alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction. It shed a national spotlight on a period that Hunter Biden described in his book as \u201ca blur of complete and utter debauchery\u201d during which he did \u201cnothing but drinking and drugging.\u201d Prosecutors leaned on the testimony of three of Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-partners \u2013 including their star witness, Hallie Biden, widow of his brother, Beau Biden \u2013 to tell the jury in excruciating detail how his dependency on crack cocaine led to the end of his marriage, strained his relationships with his kids, and put him in danger on several occasions. Hunter Biden\u2019s defense team argued, unsuccessfully, that he didn\u2019t view himself as a user or addict when he bought and possessed the gun. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell had implored the jury to acquit Hunter Biden on those grounds. This story has been updated with additional developments and reaction.

{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters", "text": "Theodore Roosevelt carefully crafted his image of rugged manliness. The wealthy heir became a Badlands cowboy and a volunteer Rough Rider and war hero. A populist and a reformer as president, Roosevelt enjoyed incredible popularity during his lifetime \u2013 and he nearly remade the American political system when, frustrated by the direction of the Republican Party after his presidency, he splintered off as a third-party candidate and nearly won election as a Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d in 1912. But that image is not complete, according to \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President,\u201d a new biography by Edward O\u2019Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, which is constructing a new Roosevelt library in the Badlands of North Dakota. O\u2019Keefe is also a former colleague at CNN. The book argues that the women in Roosevelt\u2019s life do not get the historical attention they deserve, something O\u2019Keefe proves with detailed research and engaging writing. I talked to O\u2019Keefe about the book and how Roosevelt and his definition of masculinity relate to today. Our conversation by phone, edited for length, is below: Notoriously masculine, but the product of unsung women WOLF: Your book is about the women behind the most notoriously masculine president. What were you trying to do here?  O\u2019KEEFE: \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d argues that the most masculine president in the American memory is actually the product of unsung and extraordinary women. Theodore Roosevelt is chiseled in marble on Mount Rushmore, and the myth is that everything he did in his incredibly successful personal and political life was the product of his own will. That is true, but it also isn\u2019t the full story. His two sisters, Bamie (Anna) and Conie (Corinne); his two wives, Alice and Edith; and his mother Mittie (Martha) were an integral part of his success, and their stories have been almost entirely lost to history. Frequently absent at times of emotional difficulty WOLF: That theme shines through \u2014 that these women propped up this most famous of American men. But much of his life is built around leaving them. He was not there when his first wife gave birth. He left his second wife, who was critically ill, to go off with the Rough Riders. He\u2019s on safari. He\u2019s in the Badlands. He\u2019s very absent. How do you reconcile that fact with the larger theme of the book? O\u2019KEEFE: I\u2019m so glad you noticed that. I had this fascinating conversation with Connie Roosevelt, who is the wife of Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy\u2019s great-grandson). The first time I met her in 2019, we were at a fundraiser for the National Parks Conservation Association, and I had just started to work on the research for what would become \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d And I said to Connie almost exactly as you\u2019re saying, that there is this pattern that Theodore Roosevelt is absent. He leaves in a lot of emotionally difficult circumstances. And she chuckled and said, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go hunting,\u201d which is a line that I do use in the book. Theodore Roosevelt, who is known for willing himself through physical pain \u2014 that resilience of a cowboy and a rancher would really wilt when it came to emotionally difficult circumstances. He basically abandoned his daughter for the better part of three years, offered to give his daughter to his sister and have Bamie, his elder sister, raise her. He later said of his exploits in Cuba that he would have left his wife\u2019s deathbed to be there, and that\u2019s not an exaggerated statement. I think that the women in his life understood that they needed to be the support system, especially emotionally, that he didn\u2019t always have the capacity to have. I think if there\u2019s one surprising thing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d in addition to the argument that TR is actually the product of women, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an incredibly emotional person, as much as he\u2019s caricatured in history. I love Robin Williams and the depiction in \u201cNight at the Museum,\u201d but that\u2019s a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt. It\u2019s easy to caricature him with the big smile and teeth and the hat and the cowboy, but he\u2019s a very sensitive, emotional person who feels very deeply. I think it\u2019s what allowed him to empathize with people. It\u2019s what allowed him to connect with people. That\u2019s all, by the way, a direct result of the influence of his mother, Mittie, who\u2019s been completely written off in history. How a wealthy person became a populist leader WOLF: The gender inequality of the day is a major takeaway from this book. But also the general inequality. Roosevelt was born into fabulous wealth. These are people that take monthslong trips to Europe when he\u2019s a child. He is never not wealthy. But then he escapes that perception to become this populist leader. When inequality is such a big issue today, how do you view his rise from that perspective? O\u2019KEEFE: Theodore Roosevelt is not a Horatio Alger story. He does not rise from humble beginnings to find his way to the upper echelons of power and wealth in America. Interestingly, the expectation in the Victorian and Gilded Age was that those with the greatest amount in society owed very little back to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, like his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, was considered a traitor to his class. It was very unusual for someone of his status and wealth to run for office. Politics was seen as a dirty business, something that the middle and lower classes, that the immigrant class would be interested in, because why would you need the power of the vote? You have wealth. You have influence. I think some of that is due to the influence of his parents, Mittie and Thee (Theodore Sr.), a Southerner and a Northerner, who were able to disagree without being disagreeable over one of the most contentious issues in American memory, the Civil War. He saw them come together as a family and be interested in the unity of their family as well as the country. He did have a noblesse oblige. He did feel that to whom much is given, much is required. And I think that experience out in the Badlands of North Dakota \u2014 where it didn\u2019t matter if you were wealthy; you were expected to work equally with the person alongside you. A horse in a roundup doesn\u2019t much care if you\u2019re from the East Side of Manhattan \u2014 you\u2019re either gonna survive and do the work or you\u2019re not gonna make it. Connecting Roosevelt to Biden WOLF: The most gripping part of the book is your description of the circumstances around his first wife dying in childbirth and his mother dying in the same house on the same day. I was trying to quantify that level of tragedy, and the first thing that popped to my mind was the current president, Joe Biden, who lost his wife and his daughter just after he was first elected to the Senate. I wonder if you also made that connection. O\u2019KEEFE: Absolutely. Loss which no one ever hopes to experience is often the crucible of an individual\u2019s life. In Theodore\u2019s circumstance, it was his mother, Mittie, after his father\u2019s death, that said, we need to live for the living, not for the dead \u2014 that you would dishonor the memory of those who are gone if you did not live a life of purpose. I think that\u2019s very similar to President Biden\u2019s circumstances, absolutely. You know, he took the seat in the Senate that then, of course, he held for 36 years, in part because it would be a dishonor to the memory of his wife and daughter if he didn\u2019t. Loss and happenstance, fate and serendipity play such an incredible role in American history. You have to look at these moments, these crucible moments, as the turning points of not just these individual political lives but how they intertwine with the fate of the nation. A new focus on 21st-century masculinity WOLF: There\u2019s been a rise recently, particularly on the American political right, of men trying to reassert masculinity. Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who wrote a book about Roosevelt, more recently has a book called \u201cManhood,\u201d for instance. What do you think Roosevelt would make of that trend? O\u2019KEEFE: It\u2019s exactly what he was experiencing at his time. When Roosevelt was born in 1858, there\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no airplanes, there\u2019s no submarines. He will be the first president to go up on an airplane, to ride a car, to travel abroad while president, to go in a submarine. Everything changes, right? The society is shifting from agrarian to industrial. The technology that is coming in this age is disrupting how people feel about their sense of self and connection and community. There\u2019s an immigration wave in the country that, in the view of many, is changing what the definition of what an American is, and there\u2019s a fierce debate about whether we\u2019re an isolationist country, or we\u2019re going to be a global power. Does any of this sound familiar? This all intersects with masculinity and gender roles, right? There are constant themes of masculinity. How to be a man. What does it mean to be a man. What do you have to physically do in order to show that you\u2019re a man. He\u2019ll project the quintessential ideal of manhood in society\u2019s expectations at the turn of the 20th century. But what I\u2019m showing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d is that he too had this incredible emotional, soft side \u2014 that it was women, who were constrained by the age, working with him to achieve his goals. To your question about what is happening now, people trying to understand gender roles, masculinity, manhood \u2014 instead of looking at it as a continuum, trying to sort of define it as one or the other, to me, it sounds very much like something I\u2019ve heard before, if you pay attention to history. The duality of Roosevelt in the killing of a dog WOLF: There\u2019s a moment in the book when Roosevelt has just had a falling-out with Edith, his childhood sweetheart, who would later become his second wife. He\u2019s riding his horse home and, in a moment of pique, shoots a neighbor\u2019s dog. As I was reading that passage, I immediately thought of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced serious backlash for writing in her memoir about shooting a family dog who was unruly. Obviously, the 19th century was a different time, but I wondered if you thought of Roosevelt when you read about Noem, a Dakota lawmaker. Is she not just living \u201cthe strenuous life?\u201d O\u2019KEEFE: There\u2019s a stark difference between a family pet, as described by the governor of South Dakota, and an animal running in the Oyster Bay woods (in New York) that was owned by a neighbor. But this is the duality of Theodore Roosevelt. If you go out to Sagamore Hill (Roosevelt\u2019s home), to this day, one of the most touching parts is the pet cemetery, where they\u2019ve got the graves of all the different, many beloved animals that they had. The Roosevelts had a menagerie, a veritable zoo at the White House \u2014 Josiah the badger and Emily Spinach, the snake whom Alice (his daughter, who was named for her mother) named because she didn\u2019t like her aunt, Emily, and she didn\u2019t like spinach, so her snake must be Emily Spinach; Algonquin, the pony who was taken up to the second floor of the White House. They had so many dogs in their home, both in Sagamore and in the White House, that the pet cemetery is filled with the names of these beloved family pets. So it\u2019s incongruous with Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s attitude about pets and animals, but yes, it is true that after he broke up with Edith, he was so angry that he did indeed shoot a dog on a horseback ride through the woods around Oyster Bay. An unusual parallel, perhaps, to today\u2019s stories.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_trump-classified-documents-case", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has once again asked a judge to throw out the classified documents case, arguing this time that investigators destroyed exculpatory evidence by rifling through boxes for classified documents gathered in the FBI\u2019s 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. The motion filed late Monday touches on allegations that have already come up in court \u2013 that the Justice Department allegedly tampered with evidence that would have been good for the former president. One of Trump\u2019s codefendants asked Judge Aileen Cannon in May for a delay in the case\u00a0because defense attorneys were struggling to understand the order of documents in the dozens of boxes seized by the FBI. Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team has already acknowledged in court that some of the documents may be out of order. In a\u00a0May court filing, prosecutors wrote that \u201cthere are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,\u201d adding in a footnote that \u201cthe Government acknowledges that this is inconsistent with what Government counsel previously understood and represented to the Court.\u201d Trump\u2019s defense lawyers claim in their motion Monday that classified documents found during the search were \u201cburied in boxes and comingled with President Trump\u2019s personal effects from his first term in office,\u201d so it was likely that the former president had no idea what was in the boxes \u2013 let alone if there were classified documents inside. But, according to Trump, those boxes have been tampered with because investigators failed to maintain the order of their contents. Investigators \u201cmade little if any effort to document the location of seized items within a box or to maintain the order of documents within each box that they searched,\u201d defense attorneys wrote. The individuals who searched the boxes showed a \u201ccallous attitude toward President Trump\u2019s rights and a disregard of basic professionalism,\u201d the attorneys wrote. They continued, \u201cThe government was more interested in staging\u2014and leaking\u2014manipulated photographs to the press than preserving key exculpatory evidence that has now been lost forever.\u201d If Cannon declines to throw out the charges, Trump\u2019s attorneys asked that she throw out any evidence gathered during the 2022 search. The judge has yet to decide several additional motions to dismiss the case from Trump and his two co-defendants. Cannon rejected one of their efforts to throw out the case Monday evening, ruling against their claims that the indictment suffered technical defects warranting its dismissal. However, the judge gave them a small victory by removing from an indictment prosecutors\u2019 account of Trump allegedly showing a classified map to a political adviser, as the map was not one of the documents Trump is charged with mishandling. The ruling left open the possibility that Smith\u2019s office could seek to put that alleged episode back into the evidence of the case. All three have pleaded not guilty. Since the disclosure that some of the documents fell out of order, Republicans in Congress have also seized on the revelation. In a previous court filing, prosecutors stressed that the documents have remained in the individual boxes within which they were found and argued that the disclosure that they shifted in order was no reason to drag out the case\u2019s proceedings.\u00a0They also noted that a third-party review of the seized materials that Cannon ordered after the Mar-a-Lago search may be part of the reason that the documents fell out of order. The Trump team countered in their new filing that discovery materials recently produced to the defense suggested that the FBI\u2019s filter team \u2014 which sifted through the seized documents before Cannon ordered the third-party review and which was tasked with segregating documents potentially subject to privilege \u2014 had not preserved the original order of the documents within the boxes. Smith\u2019s office said in a statement attached to Trump\u2019s Monday filing that the \u201cmisconduct allegations are, once again, false,\u201d and that prosecutors had met their legal obligations. In addition to the Monday filing seeking to throw out the case, the defense lawyers sought and received from the judge an extension on\u00a0a deadline for them to disclose the expert witnesses they could potentially put on the stand during an eventual trial. The defense attorneys said that an expert they were hoping to put on their witness list had decided against participating in the case. Smith\u2019s office had opposed the delay, according to the filings. The disclosures are now due July 8.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/trump-classified-documents-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_biden-israel-hostage-rescue-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s power to engineer a swift abatement of the war between Israel and Hamas just suffered two serious new blows. Fallout from an Israeli special forces rescue mission in Gaza, which retrieved four hostages but killed scores of Palestinian civilians, and the resignation of centrist Benny Gantz from Israel\u2019s war cabinet on Sunday sharpened political and diplomatic dilemmas Biden has struggled for months to reconcile. \u2022 The return of four hostages was a moment of joy for their families, and for all Israelis, and was welcomed by the United States. But the humanitarian toll of the operation underscores the carnage Israel has inflicted on civilians often used by Hamas as human shields in the war, which erupted with the radical Islamic group\u2019s assault on Israel on October 7. \u2022 The latest bloodshed in Gaza could further estrange Biden from progressives in his electoral coalition who are outraged at his support for Israel, its operations and its failure to do more to shield civilians. Any significant drop-off in votes from this constituency could endanger Biden in swing states where his rematch against Donald Trump could be decided by thousands of votes. The issue is especially fraught in Michigan, a potentially decisive state in November, which is home to significant numbers of Arab Americans. Vice President Kamala Harris was confronted by a protester during an appearance in the key swing state on Saturday night as she welcomed the hostage release while mourning civilians who were killed. \u2022 The rescue mission also emphasizes the disparity in the death toll between Palestinians and Israelis in the conflict. This is likely to further isolate Israel internationally from nations horrified by the Hamas attacks and to inject further tension between Washington and its allies over the war. Around 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks, while thousands of Palestinians have died in Gaza. \u2022 Gaza\u2019s bloodiest day in six months, according to authorities there, could also further narrow the political room available to key Arab states involved in the intense US diplomatic efforts to end the fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is nevertheless headed back to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Qatar this week to try to hike pressure on Hamas to agree a deal. New turmoil in Israeli politics The resignation of Gantz, a retired army general who said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has no plans for ultimate victory in Gaza or what happens afterward, will have significant domestic and international consequences but is unlikely to transform Israeli politics. \u2022 Gantz\u2019s party is not a member of the prime minister\u2019s governing coalition, so his departure is unlikely to immediately bring Netanyahu down. If Netanyahu were eventually brought down, it would likely please the Biden administration because of tensions with the prime minister, his refusal to accept US calls to do more to shield Palestinian civilians and his willingness to side with Republicans using the conflict to damage Biden. \u2022 But the loss of Gantz could make Netanyahu more reliant on hard-right members of his coalition who have been pushing him for an even more intense prosecution of the war. That could raise the risks of escalation, which could intensify the simmering wider regional war in which the US is involved. \u2022 The absence of Gantz may also create an even greater obstacle to approval of any peace deal between Israel and Hamas. Besides Netanyahu, the only remaining member of the emergency government with decision-making power is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, also from the prime minister\u2019s Likud party. \u2022 The fracturing of the Israeli war cabinet and Gantz\u2019s call for elections could have unpredictable consequences in Israel amid rising protests against Netanyahu. Thousands of people showed up this weekend in marches in multiple cities calling for the release of the remaining hostages and the chance to vote. Biden\u2019s Middle East problem never seems to get better The latest twist in the Gaza conflict came with Biden in France on a trip marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, which he used to warn of growing threats to global democracy and to toughen his political attacks on Trump and the ex-president\u2019s increasingly obvious authoritarian tendencies. National security adviser Jake Sullivan encapsulated the administration\u2019s complex political and diplomatic conundrum in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Speaking against a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower on Sunday, he told Dana Bash the US \u201cdid not participate militarily\u201d in the operation to rescue the four Israeli hostages after a US official earlier said that an American \u201ccell\u201d in Israel took part in efforts to free hostages. Sullivan said US assets had been supporting Israel in helping to identify the locations of those held following the October 7 attacks. Sullivan also reinforced US calls for a ceasefire, despite doubts that Hamas will agree to one and a belief among some Democrats in Washington that Netanyahu may seek to prolong the war to bolster his hopes of political survival. Washington has been tireless in the search for a halt to the fighting. But its failure to create a breakthrough raises questions about US leverage and Biden\u2019s prestige on the world stage five months from Election Day. \u201cThe best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cInnocent people were tragically killed in this operation,\u201d Sullivan added. \u201cThe exact number we don\u2019t know, but innocent people were killed. And that is heartbreaking. That is tragic.\u201d But the national security adviser\u2019s comments will do nothing to ease Biden\u2019s domestic political exposure over the war. The administration is caught between his left flank and Republicans who have strong political incentives to damage Biden and to deepen ties with their far-right ideological partner Netanyahu. The president\u2019s impossible straddle is likely to become even more testing when Netanyahu takes up on July 24 an invitation to address Congress, which was signed by all four congressional leaders but initiated by Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Biden has been incessantly heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters at campaign events since the war erupted, and any large demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August could create poor optics and play into Trump\u2019s narrative that a law enforcement crackdown is needed in out-of-control cities. Sen. Tom Cotton voiced the GOP\u2019s hardline on the conflict when he said Sunday on Fox News that he\u2019d spoken to Netanyahu to congratulate him on the raid. The Arkansas Republican also chided \u201cthe progressive left here in America, to include The New York Times and Washington Post\u201d for highlighting the loss of large numbers of innocent civilians killed during the Israeli operation. While casting doubt on the casualty figures, Cotton said on Fox News, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want your people killed in hostage rescue missions, then you shouldn\u2019t take hostages in the first place.\u201d Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said at least 274 people were killed and hundreds were wounded during the IDF\u2019s operation to free four Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the health ministry\u2019s figures. Israel\u2019s political crisis deepens in a way that will test Biden Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, said he was pulling out of Netanyahu\u2019s government because the prime minister put personal political considerations ahead of post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, and he called on the prime minister to hold an election. \u201cDo not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. Netanyahu had called on Gantz to stay. But his departure doesn\u2019t immediately imperil the governing coalition, which still has 64 seats in the 120-member Knesset. The hostage rescue raid and new turbulence in Israeli politics follow Biden\u2019s latest bid to end the war last month when he publicly laid out a three-phase peace plan that would begin with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages and more humanitarian relief in Gaza. His call was endorsed by G7 leaders and was seen by some analysts as an attempt to box in Netanyahu since the deal originally came from the Israelis. In response, Netanyahu insisted the war would not end until Hamas was defeated. Hamas responded positively. Netanyahu\u2019s legendary staying power and the reality of the political calendar means there\u2019s a strong chance Biden will be forced to deal with the prime minister for the rest of his reelection campaign amid a conflict that could end both their political careers. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East peace negotiator for multiple US presidents, said Sunday on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d that the Israeli prime minister would try to run out the US political clock since the Knesset goes into recess on July 25 and doesn\u2019t return until shortly before the US election. \u201cI think he is going to try to buy time before then and make a judgment on how he wants to comport himself with respect to the next US president,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote in our election, but if he could, I suspect if he wouldn\u2019t be voting for Joe Biden.\u201d Biden has argued that Israel has degraded Hamas to such an extent that it should now begin to contemplate the security end game for Gaza. Some US experts believe it will be impossible to fully eradicate Hamas. But the group seems unlikely to embrace a permanent peace deal that would lead to it losing power in Gaza \u2014 one reason why the situation is so intractable. \u201cIn order to beat Hamas politically, you\u2019ve got to introduce another element here. The Saudis, the [United Arab Emirates], and the other Arab governments are willing to do it. You\u2019re going to need some role for the Palestinian Authority,\u201d Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday. \u201cPresident Biden made it clear that the United States will be a partner, but it needs Israel to pivot to that place. But it\u2019s unwilling to, so I think what we\u2019ll likely to see is the war in Gaza continue for some time, albeit at a lower level,\u201d Haass added. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at probably a long, slow grind in Gaza.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/biden-israel-hostage-rescue-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_marjorie-taylor-greene-republicans", "text": "GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was a team player and a reliable Republican leadership ally for nine months under former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, willing to swallow tough votes and fall in line even when it meant defying her right-wing colleagues. All of that has changed. Now, under Speaker Mike Johnson, Greene is increasingly acting out, from outbursts at committee hearings to unsuccessfully trying to oust Johnson from the speakership to pressuring House Republican leaders to take uncomfortable votes. Those actions have made the Georgia Republican \u2014 who was kicked out of the far-right House Freedom Caucus last year after feuding with members \u2014 persona non grata inside the House GOP Conference, where there is little patience for her tactics and where some Republicans have even been calling for Greene to face repercussions. In the last two weeks alone, in the wake of former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in his hush money case, Greene has pressured Johnson to put on the floor a long-shot impeachment resolution against President Joe Biden and has called on the speaker to shut down the government this fall rather than continue to fund the Department of Justice \u2014 two ideas that more centrist Republicans are against. \u201cThis is supposed to be a collaborative body, at least within your own conference, and she doesn\u2019t play nice in the sandbox,\u201d GOP Rep. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez of Florida told CNN. But Greene is largely embracing her lone-wolf status and feels increasingly emboldened because of the backing she still has from MAGA supporters across the country \u2013 including from Trump, who recently endorsed her for reelection and tapped her to warm up the crowd during his rally in Las Vegas over the weekend. Those dynamics were on full display last month at a House Oversight Committee meeting that devolved into chaos that overshadowed its purpose, which was to vote on a resolution holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress \u2013 a top Republican priority. During the markup, Greene sparked outrage when she commented on Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett\u2019s appearance. But when Democrats requested that she apologize, Greene privately delivered a blunt message to House Oversight Chair James Comer. \u201cThere\u2019s no f**king way I\u2019m doing that. I won\u2019t apologize. And I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Greene told CNN of what she relayed to Comer, a Kentucky Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t care what happens in this committee room \u2014 I will not leave.\u201d Several sources who witnessed the interaction say Greene brought up her support with Republican voters as Comer debated how to defuse the tension, with Greene remarking that her \u201cpeople\u201d would not appreciate any effort to silence her \u2014 which some interpreted as an indirect threat that the MAGA base would turn on anyone who stands in her way. The megaphone that comes from her mobilized following, sources say, impacts how her Republican colleagues handle Greene \u2014 even when they disagree with her or don\u2019t believe she has much sway, at least within the House GOP. \u201cThey are over her, but they still fear her, because she has an incredible audience and fundraising mechanism and could turn that against you,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0a GOP lawmaker told CNN. For her part, Greene does not seem to care what her colleagues think of her. She has been openly warring with GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who sided with Democrats in a recent committee vote trying to silence Greene; campaigning against fellow Republican Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, who endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump; and even called her own conference \u201cfeckless, useless\u201d and one that \u201cdoes nothing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve really gotten past all that,\u201d Greene said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in angering anybody or upsetting anyone. What I am interested in is being a part of a Republican conference that does something for a change.\u201d But even as the internal disagreements with Greene stack up, she still has her share of close allies in the House, and some colleagues believe she brings benefits to their conference. \u201cYou agree and disagree. Different issues come up,\u201d GOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina told CNN. \u201cShe\u2019s with us more than she\u2019s against us.\u201d GOP leaders weigh how to manage MTG The recent shift in Greene\u2019s behavior, in large part, can be attributed to the very different management styles of the GOP\u2019s two most recent speakers. After the controversial congresswoman first came to Congress in 2021 and was kicked off her committee assignments by Democrats and some Republicans for\u00a0past\u00a0racist and antisemitic remarks that appeared to promote violence, Greene was poised to become a loose cannon in the Republican conference. But McCarthy made a conscious decision early on to bring her into the fold, meeting with her regularly one-on-one and trying to make her feel involved. In turn, Greene saw the benefits of playing the inside game \u2014\u00a0such as getting her preferred committee assignments when Republicans won the majority \u2014 and McCarthy was able to largely rein her in. \u201c(McCarthy) kept her in Bubble Wrap,\u201d a GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak freely, told CNN. Johnson, however, came onto the scene without the time or patience to build up good will with Greene. With a building-the-plane-as-it-was-taking-off mentality, the speaker had to navigate his unruly majority through the threat of multiple government shutdowns and did not have the luxury of laying groundwork with members who could cause him headaches. Now, as he looks to pivot into campaign mode ahead of November, Johnson is contending with just how much attention to give Greene as she dangles threats \u2014 serious or not \u2014 over his head. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska framed the internal debate over how to handle Greene in familial terms: \u201cYou can only do so much. I have four kids, eight grandkids. You can\u2019t give all the attention to the one who is not behaving.\u201d After Greene\u2019s effort to remove Johnson from his job failed spectacularly, Republican leaders are less worried about her disruptive tactics and believe the failed vote exposed just how little following she has inside the House GOP. But the GOP\u2019s narrow majority gives any single member the power to have at least some sway over the conference\u2019s agenda. Plus, though Trump disagreed with Greene\u2019s effort to depose Johnson as speaker, it doesn\u2019t appear to have impaired her standing in MAGA world. And Greene being untethered to any group dynamics adds to the likelihood that she could prioritize personal vendettas over what the rest of the conference wants. \u201cShe is not part of any group,\u201d one GOP lawmaker said of Greene. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of an island unto herself.\u201d Greene\u2019s latest ploy While Johnson has not shown much of an appetite to play by Greene\u2019s rules, he has also made an effort to at least hear her out. Last week, he met with Greene in his office, where she laid out a wish list of actions she wants the speaker to take in the wake of Trump\u2019s conviction. That includes putting a long-shot and politically dicey resolution on the floor impeaching Biden over problems at the southern border, defunding the special counsel\u2019s criminal investigations into Trump, and even letting government funding lapse \u2014 all in response to the former president\u2019s guilty verdict in New York. \u201cWe aren\u2019t a serious country anymore. We\u2019re literally a banana republic. So what does it matter funding the government? The American people don\u2019t give a sh*t,\u201d Greene told CNN last week after her meeting with Johnson. It\u2019s not the first time Greene has tried the unpopular move of undermining the committee process and House GOP leadership. Late last year, she threatened to force a vote on impeaching Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas before the committees leading the investigation had concluded their work. GOP leadership under Johnson ultimately convinced her to back off after they vowed to put it on the floor in the new year. But impeaching Mayorkas, which failed on the first attempt on the House floor, was seen as an easier lift than impeaching Biden. Now, Johnson wants to avoid a snap impeachment vote against the president that would be doomed in the Senate anyway and would put the speaker\u2019s most vulnerable members in a difficult position that their Democratic opponents could use as a cudgel in November. A sweeping response to Trump\u2019s conviction like what Greene has proposed doesn\u2019t sit well with many of her Republican colleagues, even those who support the former president and believe the verdict against him was politically motivated. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you cure one hasty ill-advised action with another,\u201d GOP Rep. Nick LaLota of New York said of Greene\u2019s proposals. \u201cI think that she feels that the score will be settled if we do something equally as hasty here, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how the government should work.\u201d Johnson, who is under immense pressure from his right flank to go after the Justice Department in response to the Trump verdict and who has warmed to the idea of defunding the special counsel\u2019s investigation, defended his approach as he weighs different options. \u201cThis is not retribution,\u201d Johnson told CNN last week. \u201cThis is about trying to reset the parameters and to make the people trust our system again.\u201d The day after her Johnson meeting, Greene again ruffled feathers among Republicans \u2014 this time, at a committee hearing about the origins of Covid-19, where she refused to call Dr. Anthony Fauci a \u201cdoctor.\u201d That prompted the panel\u2019s GOP chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup, to reprimand Greene in the moment and instruct her to address Fauci by his proper title, which she refused to do. But after the fact, Wenstrup was careful not to criticize Greene directly. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate that both sides of the aisle seem to have some people that have different tactics,\u201d the Ohio Republican told CNN when asked about Greene\u2019s behavior.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-republicans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_va-job-cuts-frontline-worker-invs", "text": "US Department of Veterans Affairs officials have eliminated frontline jobs for staffers who provide care to veterans,\u00a0even though agency leaders previously declared such positions would largely be protected from cuts,\u00a0according to a CNN review of documents and interviews with more than 20 VA employees and job applicants. Positions for psychologists, clinical social workers and others have been cut, and some job offers have been rescinded in recent weeks and months as the agency seeks to address a budgetary shortfall and shave its workforce by 10,000 positions. The job reductions come at a time when some veterans continue to face extended wait times for service and as suicides among veterans remain disproportionately high. The cuts have rankled rank-and-file VA employees as their department has been embroiled in a scandal for improperly awarding about $11 million in bonuses to senior VA executives last year, as detailed in a May inspector general report. VA Secretary Denis McDonough said the VA canceled the bonuses and began recouping them after realizing the error. The eliminations follow a surge in VA hiring. The agency added tens of thousands of staffers to its ranks last year to keep pace with an increase in veterans seeking care, but VA insiders now fear the job eliminations \u2014 especially those involving frontline positions \u2014 could undercut their health system. In recent weeks, lawmakers have requested information from the VA about its job reduction strategy after hearing reports that jobs that provide direct care for veterans have been targeted. CNN has confirmed with VA staffers and prospective hires that offers for such positions have been rescinded. VA Under Secretary for Health Dr. Shereef Elnahal issued internal memos in late May directing managers to continue hiring for roles vital to patient safety and to quality and timeliness of care. He also said certain key positions geared toward suicide prevention, homelessness and women\u2019s health that had been frozen should be reactivated and filled. Elnahal did, however, say administrative roles and certain clinical positions \u2014 such as those that could be accomplished by other employees \u2014 could be cut. It remains unclear how many frontline positions that were on the chopping block could be reinstated following Elnahal\u2019s updated guidance, and whether applicants who had offers rescinded would be offered the jobs again. VA spokesperson Terrence Hayes told CNN in a statement that while the VA continues to strategically hire in key areas, such as mental health and in locations with spikes in veterans seeking care, the agency has \u201cthe nationwide staffing total we need to deliver for our nation\u2019s Veterans.\u201d Hayes said that local VA leaders have authority to make decisions about the staff they hire. \u201cThere are no plans for an enterprise-wide hiring freeze or layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that the VA has onboarded thousands of mental health professionals over the last three years. Recently, local VA managers have been issuing internal warnings about hiring. \u201cThe recent VA strategic hiring initiative has placed considerable strain on all our services and disciplines across our facility, both clinical and non-clinical,\u201d wrote Dr. Mark Kadowaki, the chief of staff for the VA medical center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, in a May email to staff obtained by CNN. VA spokesperson Hayes said the Iron Mountain medical center has had a net increase in employees this year and has added specialty providers. The staffing shakeup has also triggered backlash on Capitol Hill. In April, the top two senators on the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs called the staff reduction plan a \u201cmess.\u201d A separate group of senators requested language in a bill that would direct the VA to share details on employee vacancies, positions cut, and how those could affect care. \u201cInconsistent staffing patterns put veterans\u2019 healthcare quality and accessibility at risk,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter. Dr. Harold Kudler, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Duke University who has four decades of experience serving veterans through the VA, questioned the decision to rescind offers for frontline positions and said, \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. If you remove access to expert care \u2014 if you remove access to the largest suicide prevention program in the country, if not the world \u2014 then that\u2019s not good for veterans.\u201d Kudler and others expressed particular concern about cuts involving mental health care. A Government Accountability Office report in February noted that veterans suffer a disproportionately high rate of suicide, with an average of almost 18 veterans dying daily by suicide in 2021, about 72% greater than the general adult population. Job offers axed The plan to downsize comes after the VA went on a hiring spree last year amid an increase in veterans seeking care. In 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to various toxic substances.\u00a0More veterans enrolled for VA care and the department\u2019s health administration hired more than 60,000 employees in fiscal year 2023, which swelled the VA\u2019s ranks to more than 400,000 total staffers.\u00a0\u00a0 But a budgetary shortfall has led the department to make reductions, officials say. Elnahal said at a news conference in March that he believed the VA could eliminate up to 10,000 positions through \u201cattrition and voluntary separation,\u201d without compromising care for veterans. He said such cuts would primarily focus on positions that were \u201cmore managerial, programmatic individuals, supervisory roles that aren\u2019t necessarily over the point of care directly.\u201d But multiple VA sources told CNN that reductions have seemed less strategic than Elnahal promised. And they have accused the department of slow-walking hires for positions they called critical. \u201cIt\u2019s actually direct-care staff that\u2019s being eliminated,\u201d said Tiffany Roman of Pueblo, Colorado, a VA nurse who works as the vice president of a local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees union. In an April email shared by another source, a VA manager in Central Texas, Stacy Ritz, told local staffers that 22 vacant positions related to mental health and behavioral medicine had been \u201cabolished,\u201d meaning the jobs were no longer \u201con the books.\u201d Ritz wrote that her team could \u201cask for them back when the financial situation is more optimistic,\u201d though she described the losses as \u201cpainful.\u201d VA spokesperson Hayes said those abolished positions had been vacant for half a year and that local leadership can refill them if needed. He said the Central Texas VA has increased mental health staffing in the last three years. Some VA staffers have questioned the logic behind many of the cuts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like they are assessing clinical needs,\u201d said Chris Mapps, president of a local AFGE union chapter in Michigan and a VA advanced medical support assistant. \u201cIt seems to be based on them telling the facilities, \u2018These are your numbers you got to hit.\u2019\u201d William Hazel, a clinical social worker who has worked for the federal government for years, experienced one of the cuts. Hazel said that he applied last year for a VA social worker position based in the US territory of Guam, which he said lacks many of the mental healthcare resources available in parts of the US mainland. He hoped to help veterans overcome substance abuse and other challenges. After receiving a tentative job offer in September, Hazel said, he continued moving through the agency\u2019s onboarding process. In March, the government notified him that although he was an \u201cexceptional candidate,\u201d the offer had been rescinded due to \u201cbudgetary issues the Agency is experiencing and other unforeseen circumstances,\u201d according to an email he shared with CNN. Hazel told CNN he was disappointed. \u201cThey say that mental health is a critical element to them, yet we were cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe motto of the VA is to care for him who has borne the battle. Are they doing that? I respectfully submit, no.\u201d \u201cI feel like I have been betrayed and left out to dry,\u201d said another applicant who received a tentative job offer for a VA position researching suicide prevention that was rescinded in March after the applicant had moved to the state where the job was located. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still wants to work for the VA. Yet another applicant who had a tentative offer for a VA staff psychologist position rescinded in March \u2014 also \u201cdue to unforeseen circumstances,\u201d according to a government email \u2014 said the experience made her question the extent to which the VA truly prioritizes mental healthcare. She also spoke anonymously due to plans to reapply for VA jobs. Asked about the staffing cuts at a Senate hearing in May, VA Secretary McDonough said that the federal budget \u201cdoes force some choices\u201d on his department, though he said the agency\u2019s retention of employees had been at \u201chistoric highs\u201d and that it is \u201cbetter sourced with clinicians\u201d due to spikes in hiring in recent years. He also said the VA could continue to strategically fill positions based on clinical need. The VA has been touting in news releases that department surveys show trust in the VA has increased among veterans and that wait times for new patient appointments in primary and mental healthcare slightly decreased in April. Still, a Government Accountability Office report published this month found challenges with the VA\u2019s ability to provide timely care and noted that many VA facilities last year took more than two weeks to even schedule mental health appointments in the private sector, an option used when veterans have to wait too long or travel too far for VA care. The VA said in response to the report that it was seeking to improve the timely scheduling of such appointments. Some warn any momentum in improving VA care could be undercut by decisions to trim health workers. \u201cAny time you impact staffing, any time you lower the potential for one-on-one care, any time you lower the areas of need \u2014 mental health, primary care, surgeries \u2014 that always poses a risk,\u201d said Jeff Shapiro, the president of the VA council for the National Federation of Federal Employees union. \u201cIt\u2019s a managerial problem.\u201d CNN\u2019s Allison Gordon and Kyung Lah contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/va-job-cuts-frontline-worker-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fascism-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "This week, Americans and Europeans celebrated the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces invaded occupied France, marking the beginning of the end of fascist power in Europe. Last week, after being found guilty of falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump said Americans today live in a \u201cfascist state,\u201d building on his unfounded conspiracy theory that somehow President Joe Biden is behind his prosecution in Manhattan. It was an ironic turn of phrase for Trump since, throughout his rise, academics and pundits have debated whether his cult-of-personality politics veers toward a form of fascism. But flipping the script on his critics is a specialty of the former president. Robert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University who has written widely on fascism in Europe, had rejected the label for Trump until January 6, 2021, when the historian argued that the image of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol \u201cremoves my objection to the fascist label.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of certain terms has forced comparisons The debate over whether Trump veers toward fascism was renewed multiple times this year after Trump\u2019s committed followers swatted away a field of qualified challengers for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has repeatedly used language that can be tied back to Nazis, such as when he said immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country. Last month, his campaign amplified and then deleted a supporter\u2019s video that promised a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins reelection. The New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat took a close look at all of the images presented in that video and concluded for CNN Opinion that the video was \u201creminiscent of the fascist propaganda I have studied for\u00a0many years.\u201d With a charismatic leader, a nationalist outlook built around fear of immigrants and a sense of grievance built around his 2020 election loss, there are certainly some ingredients of fascism in the current version of Trump\u2019s campaign. Supporters have a plan to use a second Trump term to gut portions of the civil service, supposedly to remake a government that will more easily bend to his will. His sense of persecution at facing criminal charges adds more grist. Trump has consistently teased the idea that he will repay his political rival, Biden, for his conviction. The Trump-supporting Fox News host Sean Hannity tried repeatedly on Wednesday to get Trump to rule out using the Department of Justice as an arm for vengeance, but Trump rambled around the questions. \u201cIt has to stop, because otherwise we\u2019re not going to have a country,\u201d Trump said, suggesting he would not weaponize the Justice Department. But he then said he would be fully within his rights to prosecute his political opponents.  \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president said. That\u2019s less definitive than the social media post last year when Trump verifiably promised, if he wins, to appoint a special counsel to \u201cgo after\u201d Biden, but it\u2019s certainly not a hard no. \u2018I don\u2019t care what you call this\u2019 When CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance about Trump\u2019s claim the US is a \u201cfascist state,\u201d Vance, who CNN has reported is being vetted as a potential Trump running mate, would not reject the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love,\u201d Vance said in a tense exchange. Watch it: A warning from McConnell There are comparisons between current times and the rise of fascism everywhere at the moment, even when they are not focused directly on Trump. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times commemorating D-Day titled, \u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the 1930s.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mention Trump. McConnell will step aside from his Senate GOP leadership position in November in part because his party has moved away from the arsenal-of-democracy view of American power embraced by McConnell and other old-school Republicans and toward an isolationist, Vladimir Putin-friendly view of foreign policy pushed by Trump. Arguing that we rightly celebrate D-Day soldiers, McConnell argued we often forget why those service members needed to fight in the first place. \u201cWe forget how influential isolationists persuaded millions of Americans that the fate of allies and partners mattered little to our own security and prosperity,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe gloss over the powerful political forces that downplayed growing danger, resisted providing assistance to allies and partners, and tried to limit America\u2019s ability to defend its national interests.\u201d I talked to Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and editor of the new book, \u201cDid It Happen Here? Perspectives on Fascism and America,\u201d which includes the writing of Paxton, among many others. \u201cThat model of historical comparison where we look to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and then use it as kind of a navigational device or a map for understanding what\u2019s happened today is quite common,\u201d he said, although there are arguments it is a flawed comparison. \u201cConcepts don\u2019t have timeless essences that we can just map on to any phenomena, but they change given political context, given power structures in society,\u201d he said. Today, he said, the term \u201cfascism\u201d is used \u201cto mobilize people in order to get over their divides, to defeat an enemy that\u2019s far greater than their own long-standing disputes.\u201d Steinmetz-Jenkins argued there is a long history, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, of Americans on both sides of the political aisle trying to label their opponents as \u201cfascist,\u201d and there are also examples of American lawmakers threatening their opponents with investigation. There are arguments in favor of the fascism comparison, but also arguments against it \u2013 particularly since there are echoes of Trump\u2019s rise in populist and White nationalist movements closer to home in American history. Directly comparing eras can backfire For instance, Rep. Byron Donalds, a Black Republican from Florida and another potential Trump running mate, has had to explain his argument that American social programs have driven Black families apart and that they were more cohesive at a time of legalized racial terror under Jim Crow laws in the US, which were a model for Nazis. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said in comments first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer. He tried to explain that comment to CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on Wednesday, arguing he was not expressing nostalgia for the Jim Crow era, but rather trying to argue that during that period, marriage rates were higher. It was a complicated argument for him to make, to say the least. Donalds tried to argue that the ideological divide in today\u2019s political parties should be applied to perceptions of that era, when some Southern Democrats opposed civil rights legislation and some Northern Republicans supported it. Today, the parties are even more regionally divided, with Democrats largely out of power in the South and Republicans largely out of power in the North. The parties realigned around conservative and liberal ideologies \u2013 a process that continues to happen today as Republicans reorient around Trumpism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fascism-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_antony-blinken-gaza-aid-humanitarian", "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday announced more than $400 million in new humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza as he again called on Hamas to accept a ceasefire proposal that he described as the most effective way to address the humanitarian devastation. The top US diplomat, speaking at an emergency humanitarian aid conference in Jordan, also called on nations to give more aid to support those in the war-torn strip. The humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza has become catastrophic over the eight months of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. The Israeli government has restricted access and items that have been able to make their way into the strip. Humanitarian aid organizations have had to contend with a destroyed infrastructure inhibiting their ability to deliver the critically-needed aid, and aid workers have been caught in the crossfire. \u201cThe crisis in Gaza is immense,\u201d Blinken acknowledged. \u201cOnly one third of the current United Nations appeal is funded. That leaves a shortfall of approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Every country can help fill this gap. Yet some who expressed great concern over the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, including countries with the capacity to give a lot, have provided very little \u2013 or nothing at all,\u201d Blinken said without naming specific countries. \u201cIt is time for everyone, everyone, to step up.\u201d The new $404 million in funding from the US will go toward \u201cfood, safe drinking water, health care, protection, education, shelter, and psychosocial support,\u201d according to a media note from the State Department. In his remarks Tuesday, Blinken said that \u201cparticularly in recent months, Israel has taken some important steps to open more crossings, to address obstacles to the delivery of assistance, but it can and must do more.\u201d \u201cAs we conveyed directly to the Israeli government, it is crucial to speed up the inspection trucks and reduce backlogs, to provide greater clarity on and shorten the list of prohibited goods, to increase visas for aid workers and to process them more quickly, to create clearer, more effective channels for humanitarian groups to deconflict with IDF operations, to surge life-saving medicine and equipment, to provide everything necessary to repair water and sanitation systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Israel must take further steps to reduce civilian casualties, even as it confronts an enemy that started this war with the barbaric slaughter of civilians on October 7,\u201d Blinken said. Despite Blinken\u2019s claims about the \u201cimportant steps\u201d taken by the Israeli government, humanitarian workers say that the situation on the ground has only worsened, particularly as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in Rafah, where millions of Palestinians previously fled. Blinken himself acknowledged in his remarks Tuesday that \u201cmore than a million people have been displaced from\u00a0Rafah\u00a0alone, in the last month alone \u2013 many of whom had already been uprooted multiple times.\u201d \u201cThe situation is back to one of the lowest points, which is quite shocking at this point,\u201d said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East director at Mercy Corps. There was an \u201cecosystem\u201d for humanitarian aid work in Rafah \u2013 some non-governmental organizations and UN agencies provide logistical facilities, others provide transportation, \u201ceverybody works together to make that possible,\u201d he described to CNN. But with the Israeli military operation happening since the beginning of May, \u201cit could not function anymore, it just ground to a halt.\u201d International officials and humanitarian workers have described the situation in Gaza as unprecedented in its complexity and scope. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference Tuesday that \u201cthe speed and scale of the carnage and killing in Gaza is beyond anything in my years as Secretary-General.\u201d The top US diplomat in his remarks stressed that the US sees Hamas as the sole obstacle to a ceasefire that would alleviate the humanitarian suffering. \u201cToday, as we gather, one, and only one, thing stands in the way of the deal happening, and that\u2019s Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my primary and first message today to every government, to every multilateral institution, to every humanitarian organization that wants to relieve the massive suffering in Gaza: get Hamas to take the deal.\u201d Others also emphasized the need for a ceasefire in order to enable humanitarian work. \u201cThe status quo cannot hold. Without a political agreement supporting a ceasefire, the humanitarian assistance system is pushed to a point of collapse,\u201d said Mirjana Spoljaric, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, at the conference on Tuesday.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-investigation-what-matters", "text": "It was nearly a year ago that CNN first reported about a cover-up at the Coast Guard Academy. That initial report about how the academy kept secret its own review of decades of sexual assault cover-ups continues to reverberate. This week, the Coast Guard Academy official in charge of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, resigned in protest and said the Coast Guard had made her an unwitting accomplice to a cover-up. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable,\u201d Norenberg said in a statement. Watch her appearance on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d. Separately, the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is scheduled to testify about the scandal on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where she will face tough questioning about why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. How does investigative reporting like this come to be? It took a team of\u00a0journalists\u00a0from CNN Investigates,\u00a0including Melanie Hicken,\u00a0Blake Ellis, Audrey Ash, Curt Devine and Pamela Brown. I emailed with Hicken and Ellis, reporters who have been working on this story since the beginning. Our conversation is below. WOLF: You\u2019ve been covering this Coast Guard story for some time. What was the first thread you pulled on it, and how has it unraveled? HICKEN and ELLIS: Our Coast Guard reporting all started with a young woman named Hope Hicks who was a student at a different service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy. In an anonymous blog post, she wrote about how she had been raped by her boss while out at sea \u2013 prompting a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry. As we started digging into her case, we became fascinated by this little-known industry.\u00a0We\u00a0spent months talking to merchant mariners who were assaulted while working on commercial ships and learned more about how the justice process works in the commercial shipping world \u2013\u00a0ultimately discovering that a number of sexual assaults were going unpunished and that it was all happening under the Coast Guard\u2019s watch.\u00a0So, that was the turning point where we started turning our attention to the Coast Guard. It is only because of this initial reporting on the Coast Guard and the maritime industry that we were able to ultimately break the news of the Fouled Anchor scandal. It took months to develop the trust of sources, obtain key records\u00a0and conduct sensitive interviews with victims. WOLF: A key part of the story is Operation Fouled Anchor, the secret internal probe of cover-ups. Has the Coast Guard acknowledged a cover-up?\u00a0 HICKEN and ELLIS: Reporting on this story has been so interesting because Fouled Anchor essentially ended up being a cover-up of past cover-ups.\u00a0The internal probe substantiated years of sexual assault at the US Coast Guard Academy and revealed how victims\u2019 complaints were ignored and, at times, covered up \u2013 allowing some offenders to rise to high-level positions in the Coast Guard and other military branches. Through our reporting, we learned that while there were originally plans to come clean to Congress about the reporting and its damning findings, Coast Guard leaders ultimately chose to bury it \u2013 even going so far as to make a list of pros and cons of disclosure. The Coast Guard\u2019s current leader has apologized to the workforce and Congress but has been careful to avoid calling the suppression of the Fouled Anchor investigation a cover-up. WOLF: Has there been any follow-up to look at some of those assaults from years ago? HICKEN and ELLIS: Operation Fouled Anchor itself was launched in 2014 to look at those earlier assaults when an academy graduate claimed that her allegations of rape from years earlier had never been investigated and her attacker had gone on to become a top officer in the Air Force. Despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, Fouled Anchor investigators found that most of the alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated at the time. Even after the cases were reopened during Fouled Anchor however, few alleged perpetrators were held accountable. The assailant in the case that started Fouled Anchor was the only person to face criminal charges in military court as a result of the probe, but an appeals court ended up ruling in his favor and dismissing the charges, saying that the military had missed its window to prosecute because the Coast Guard waited nearly two decades to investigate the victim\u2019s allegations. We learned that two other accused perpetrators were discreetly pushed to retire from the Coast Guard, but that there were nearly 40 cases where the Coast Guard no longer had jurisdiction over the alleged attackers and local and federal criminal statutes had long run out of time, so no action was taken at all. In terms of what is happening now, we know that the Coast Guard is currently investigating an officer for sexually harassing and groping a cadet who reported him to the academy two decades earlier\u00a0at the Coast Guard Academy (the officer\u2019s attorney denies the allegations). The former cadet brought up the allegations during\u00a0testimony\u00a0at a congressional hearing last year, but the Coast Guard didn\u2019t launch the criminal investigation until months later, after the woman said she flagged his name on a promotion list to senators. Another woman has asked Congress to reopen her rape case from 2005, which the Coast Guard has claimed it cannot pursue despite findings at the time that he had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her since he is not currently under Coast Guard jurisdiction. WOLF: There\u2019s a hearing in Congress this week. Shannon Norenberg resigned in protest. Has there been any accountability yet at the Coast Guard Academy or in the Coast Guard? HICKEN and ELLIS: It sounds like the Coast Guard\u2019s current leader, Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, will be facing a lot of tough questions at the hearing. So far, she has wanted the agency to focus on the future and make changes to policies that she hopes will help prevent sexual assault and better support survivors. But many Coast Guard members are frustrated by two major issues: that to date, the leaders who covered up Operation Fouled Anchor still haven\u2019t been held accountable and that Fagan is not acknowledging how much of an issue sexual assault still is in the service today. Shannon Norenberg was angry that she was used as part of what she described as a \u201ccruel coverup\u201d where victims and Congress were both deceived, but she is also frustrated that more hasn\u2019t changed at the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 saying perpetrators are still facing little accountability. WOLF: Having covered this for so long, what is it about the Coast Guard Academy that allowed this kind of cover-up culture to develop? Is this a problem specific to the Coast Guard or the academy? HICKEN and ELLIS: Many of the issues we have seen playing out at the Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard at large, such as fear of retaliation for speaking out about assaults, a lack of accountability for alleged perpetrators and a boys-club culture, were very similar to what we heard from those in the US Merchant Marine Academy community when we first started this reporting several years ago. We have also heard from assault survivors from across the military service who argue that our country still has a long way to go in combating military sexual assault and attempting to make survivors whole. We have also been told by some in the organization that because the Coast Guard does not fall under the Department of Defense, like the other military branches, that it has historically escaped the same level of scrutiny. Many are hopeful that maybe that can change with people who have been terrified to speak up finally feeling like they can. WOLF: You include your email addresses at the end of your stories and ask for tips to investigate. Does that ever turn into stories? HICKEN and ELLIS: Yes! We have received so much helpful information through tips in response to our stories, and many of the sexual assault survivors we have spoken with throughout our reporting originally contacted us through our tips email (watchdog@cnn.com). Many current and former Coast Guard employees have also shared information with us anonymously that has hugely informed our reporting and led to multiple follow-up stories. We\u2019re always looking for new story ideas, and a variety of our past investigations have stemmed from tips from readers, so we welcome emails!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/coast-guard-investigation-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_coast-guard-official-resigns-alleges-coverup-invs", "text": "A US Coast Guard Academy official says top leaders directed her to lie to sexual assault victims and Congress, making her an unwitting accomplice in a cover-up of decades of abuse. As a result, Shannon Norenberg says she\u2019s resigning from her role as the academy\u2019s head of sexual assault prevention and issuing a public apology to survivors, saying she is no longer willing to stay silent. \u201cThe Coast Guard lied to me,\u201d she wrote in a public statement posted online Sunday. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable.\u201d Norenberg\u2019s explosive allegations were made in advance of a congressional hearing this week at which the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is slated to testify about the agency\u2019s sexual misconduct scandal. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Norenberg said she had made it her mission to help sexual assault survivors at the Coast Guard Academy for more than a decade. She said she was devastated when she recently discovered old records showing how leaders had used her as part of the cover-up of Operation Fouled Anchor, a secret internal probe into\u00a0a history of sexual assault cover-ups that CNN exposed last summer. She wrote in her public posting that she was sent on an \u201capology tour\u201d in 2019 to brief dozens of assault victims about their cases, which had previously been mishandled by academy leadership. The list of talking points she was given at the time shows she was directed to tell victims that Congress was already fully aware of the operation, which she now knows was not the case. She believes this was intended to \u201cdissuade the victims from contacting their Members of Congress.\u201d The Coast Guard said it was a mistake \u2013 not a conspiracy \u2013 for the talking point about Congress to be on the list given to Norenberg. The agency added that Coast Guard officials recently interviewed a now-retired Coast Guard officer present during those victim meetings, and she said the talking point was never brought up. Norenberg said she didn\u2019t have a precise recollection of all the meetings, but noted she had one-on-one calls with several victims outside the presence of the now-retired officer. Norenberg also said that if she had been told that Congress was unaware, she would have notified lawmakers immediately. \u201cWhy would anyone trust anything the Coast Guard has to say about Operation Fouled Anchor at this point?\u201d she said. Norenberg was also instructed to not include the historic assaults being investigated in data that Congress would see, she said, and was prohibited from offering survivors key paperwork that would have helped them access mental health services and veteran\u2019s benefits available to sexual assault victims. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sent out there to help these people, I realized,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe whole thing was a cruel cover-up at the expense of the victims, with the entire purpose being to preserve the image of the Coast Guard and avoid scandal. And the Coast Guard used me as part of their plan.\u201d For nearly a year, Fagan has been coming under increasing pressure as she continues to grapple with the fallout from Operation Fouled Anchor. She has repeatedly said she wants to learn from the past and move forward, but a new string of controversies has shown that sexual misconduct remains pervasive across the Coast Guard and is a far bigger issue than she has publicly acknowledged. Among the developments: Adding to the pressure on Fagan, congressional lawmakers have expressed growing frustration with the Coast Guard\u2019s handling of the controversy. When Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s office discovered non-disclosure agreements that had been given to sexual assault victims as part of Fouled Anchor to prevent them from speaking out about their alleged attacks, he slammed the practice in a letter to Fagan. Soon after, the agency issued a directive to no longer execute these agreements for victims. Senators have accused Fagan of evading congressional oversight\u00a0during multiple ongoing government investigations and questioned why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. Most recently, they demanded that she appear at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, saying the Coast Guard\u2019s lack of cooperation with the ongoing congressional probe can \u201conly be explained by either its indifference or another shameful attempt to cover-up the embarrassing truths of its mishandling of cases involving sexual assault and sexual harassment.\u201d Norenberg\u2019s allegations have already been raised with senators and are expected to be part of the discussion at the hearing, her attorney told CNN. \u2018Maybe this is the moment\u2019 Victims echoed Norenberg\u2019s concerns, saying they felt their lives were turned upside down when they were asked to recount the trauma they endured as part of the Fouled Anchor investigation, only to be forgotten once again. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care about the impact on us or why we wanted to share this information,\u201d said one former Coast Guard Acadamy cadet who was visited by a Coast Guard criminal investigator in 2018.\u00a0 She originally reported being raped by a classmate in 2005, but no criminal charges were filed despite the alleged rapist being found by academy officials to have had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her. After giving her 2018 interview as part of Fouled Anchor, she said she never heard from the Coast Guard again about her case. Even Norenberg didn\u2019t know the full scope of the Fouled Anchor scandal until CNN\u2019s reporting, which found that the operation had been quietly closed and hidden from Congress by agency leaders despite substantiating dozens of sexual assaults that had previously been mishandled at the academy. As a result, some of the accused had ascended to top roles at the Coast Guard and other military agencies, while some victims had left the academy after reporting their assaults and had spent decades coping with severe negative effects to their careers and mental and physical health. Norenberg said she began questioning her involvement with Fouled Anchor after CNN\u2019s reports and found in her files the five-page list of talking points that, she said, confirmed that what she had been part of was actually an organized effort to protect the Coast Guard\u2019s reputation \u2013 not an attempt to help victims rebuild their lives. After finding the document, she knew she had to resign. Norenberg told CNN she is frustrated that many of the issues exposed by Fouled Anchor, such as perpetrators going unpunished and victims facing retaliation for coming forward, still exist today despite messaging from Commandant Fagan claiming otherwise. She had hoped that through her job leading the Coast Guard Academy\u2019s sexual assault prevention efforts and working with victims, she could improve the culture. She says she helped victims file official reports to ensure their allegations were investigated and worked to improve access to victim\u2019s advocates, but that a lack of appropriate consequences for many perpetrators remained troubling to her. Criminal prosecutions were rare, she said, with only three cases going to court-martial trials in her 11 years at the academy. And she said she repeatedly raised concerns to academy officials that accused sexual offenders who were kicked out of the academy were then allowed to enlist. Norenberg said she notified officials of her intent to resign in late May. As she weighed her next steps, she reached out to an attorney named Ryan Melogy. She had learned of Melogy after he represented a US Merchant Marine Academy cadet whose rape allegations prompted a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry several years ago. When Norenberg told Melogy she was considering going public with her concerns, he asked her if she had seen the recent uprising on social media. She had not. But later, after reviewing the litany of posts, where many current and former members said managers had looked the other way when they reported misconduct, she became even more emboldened.\u00a0 A military sexual assault survivor herself, she said her own memories of being raped by a boot camp leader when she was 18 years old had driven her into this line of work and now compelled her to come forward. She said seeing that so many others were speaking up about how they felt betrayed by the Coast Guard gave her hope that it would now be impossible for the Coast Guard to ignore them. She is planning to start a YouTube channel where she will interview survivors \u2014 giving them a platform to speak out about their sexual assaults. \u201cMaybe this is the moment in time we can get people to listen to us,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_hunter-biden-jury", "text": "The jury in the Hunter Biden gun case was deadlocked in an initial vote Monday night over whether to convict the president\u2019s son, one of the jurors told CNN in an interview, adding that \u201cno politics came into play\u201d during deliberations before they arrived at a guilty verdict. The male juror, No. 10, also said that it was a mistake to put Hunter\u2019s daughter Naomi on the stand and that jurors felt bad that she was called to testify. Hunter Biden was found guilty Tuesday of all three federal felony gun charges he faced, with the jury concluding that he violated laws meant to prevent drug addicts from owning firearms. When the jury returned earlier that morning, there was only one remaining holdout, the juror who spoke with CNN said. Over the next few hours, he said, the jury discussed the elements of each crime and the last holdout agreed that they should return a guilty verdict. While the male juror did not say whether he was a supporter of President Joe Biden, he said he felt sympathy for the family\u2019s struggle with Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction. The president\u2019s son \u201cwas just like anybody else,\u201d Juror No. 10 told CNN. But, the juror said, he based his decision to convict on the fact that Biden did not disclose that he was a drug addict when he bought a gun. \u201cWe all knew he was a drug addict,\u201d he said. \u201cIn his mind, how could he not know he was an addict?\u201d Juror No. 10 said that the case boiled down to whether Biden was addicted to crack when he purchased the gun. \u201cAll 12 jurors did agree that, yes, he knowingly bought a gun when he was an addict, or he was addicted to drugs,\u201d he said. The juror, though, also said he doesn\u2019t believe Biden belongs in jail and pointed to the fact that he did not want the gun back after Hallie Biden (the widow of\u00a0Beau\u00a0Biden who later dated his brother) took it out of his truck and threw it in the garbage near a grocery store. \u201cWhen he said he did not want that gun back, and that gun sat in evidence for almost five years, I think that\u2019s what may have been what led to his downfall. If he had taken possession of that gun, I don\u2019t know if we would have even had a trial,\u201d the juror said. Another juror told CNN that she believed Biden \u201cneeds rehab more than imprisonment or a fine.\u201d Juror No. 10 said it didn\u2019t make a difference for him that Biden did not take the stand in his own defense and that he agrees Biden was \u201cbetter off not testifying.\u201d Ultimately, Juror No. 10 said, the unilateral guilty verdicts \u201ccame down to the rules.\u201d Other jurors who spoke to CNN after they reached the guilty verdict said that they believed they had no choice but to find Biden guilty but said that they question whether the criminal case ever should have been brought against the president\u2019s son. The case \u201cseemed like a waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d one female juror told CNN, though juror No. 10 disagreed. Another male juror said that the process was \u201ca little bit frustrating because it felt like we couldn\u2019t get the full story.\u201d All three jurors said that defense lawyer Abbe Lowell made them question whether Biden intentionally lied on an ATF form, but that ultimately his defense strategy was unconvincing. \u2018Politics played no part whatsoever\u2019 Jurors who spoke with CNN said politics never played a part in their decision-making process about whether to convict the president\u2019s son. The guilty verdict \u201cwas not politically motivated,\u201d Juror No. 10 told CNN. \u201cPolitics played no part whatsoever.\u201d A second juror said she was concerned that the jury would be \u201cat each other\u2019s throats because (Biden\u2019s) father is the president and because of the political climate,\u201d but that once deliberations began, she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel pressure.\u201d A third juror added: \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel the pressure.\u201d The president on Tuesday again reiterated that he would accept the jury\u2019s verdict in a statement following the guilty verdict, but he also expressed support for his son. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. Juror No. 10 said that the president \u201cnever really even came in to play for me because his name was only brought up in one story in the trial. And that\u2019s when it \u2026 kind of sunk in a little bit. Oh, wow: This is the sitting president\u2019s son who\u2019s on trial. And so that was, yeah, that was kind of hard \u2026 but you kind of put that out of your mind. And after that, after it was brought up again, I did put it out in my mind.\u201d While the president was not in the courtroom, first lady Jill Biden was a fixture at the trial, showing support for her son. Each juror CNN spoke with acknowledged the weight of having her in the courtroom. \u201cWhen I looked at Mrs. Biden, I really felt bad for the family,\u201d Juror No. 10 said. He added that, while he didn\u2019t say how he planned to vote in the 2024 election, \u201cyou can\u2019t help but take some of these things into factor.\u201d \u2018Heart-wrenching\u2019 testimony from family Jurors said they recognized the emotional testimony in the case that saw Biden\u2019s family on the stand discussing some of the most intimate details of his struggle with drugs and alcohol. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Hunter\u2019s addiction was as bad as it was,\u201d Juror No. 10 said, adding that testimony from Biden\u2019s daughter was \u201cheart-wrenching.\u201d Naomi Biden testified about visiting her father in the summer of 2018 while he was in rehab in Los Angeles after not seeing him for some time. She came under intense cross-examination by prosecutors and was seen wiping away tears as she left the courtroom. \u201cI felt bad that they put Naomi on trial (as a) witness,\u201d Juror No. 10 told CNN. \u201cI think that was probably a strategy that should not have been done. No daughter should ever have to testify against her dad.\u201d The second juror said that she felt \u201cso sad\u201d for Naomi Biden and found her testimony difficult to listen to. Juror No. 10 said the panel did not focus heavily on Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201clifestyle,\u201d but rather, the evidence presented at the trial. \u201cIt was very sad. And Hallie testified, I mean, that was for me, that was a very sad time because I did not know that Hallie also got addicted to crack. So I really felt sorry for that,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-son-trial-analysis", "text": "It would be devastating for any parent to see a child convicted of a crime. To experience it as president before the eyes of the world, during one of the most contentious reelection campaigns in history, would be unfathomable. But that is the ordeal now confronting President Joe Biden after his only surviving son Hunter was found guilty on all counts in a trial in Delaware over his possession of a gun while being addicted to drugs. The jury delivered its verdict Tuesday less than two weeks after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump learned he had been convicted of all 34 counts in a hush money trial in New York. The double convictions represent a remarkable departure from traditional presidential campaigns. Never has a former president and presumptive major party nominee been convicted of a crime. Nor has the child of a sitting president. Both Hunter Biden and Trump pleaded not guilty. Biden\u2019s statement at the start of the trial \u2014 that \u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad\u201d \u2014 encapsulated the tension of his role as the titular head of the nation\u2019s justice system and the pain he would naturally endure from seeing a cherished son, who has dealt with addiction and worked hard to recover, go on trial in the middle of a media storm. Biden repeated that poignant line in a statement issued immediately after the verdict. And unlike former president Trump after his verdict, Biden accepted the jury\u2019s judgment and the integrity of the legal system. \u201cJill and\u00a0I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The Hunter Biden conviction is the latest cruel twist in the story of a family that has endured more tragedies than most could bear. The story of how the future president lost his first wife and infant daughter as a newly elected senator in the early 1970s and brought up his sons with his second wife, the current first lady, has become part of Biden\u2019s personal political mythology. Nearly a decade ago, Biden suffered the loss of his elder son Beau, who had brain cancer. The president\u2019s grief remains raw and often comes to the surface during public events. The trial of Hunter Biden is also occurring at a moment when the president is already under extreme pressure, amid an intensifying reelection campaign in which he is facing an opponent who he warns is bent on destroying American democracy. Biden\u2019s personal burden is, meanwhile, being exacerbated by the fact that at 81, he\u2019s the oldest president in history and opponents highlight every slip or senior moment to charge he\u2019s unfit for office. He just returned from Europe on Sunday, but heads back Wednesday for the G7 summit. And his critical first debate with Trump, on CNN on June 27, will provide the kind of test of his mental faculties and emotional fortitude to match anything any modern president seeking reelection has faced. Two vastly different cases thrust into the same political maelstrom The Hunter Biden and Trump cases are vastly different, as is the way the former and current first families have responded to the trials. For instance, there have been no daily rants by the president\u2019s son about a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d judge. Trump\u2019s conviction for falsifying financial records to cover up a payment to an adult film star, by contrast, prompted the ex-president to warn of retribution. He\u2019s also absurdly claimed he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident who compares to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela. In the latest stage of his legal morass, Trump sat through an online pre-sentencing meeting Monday that came two days after he used his Truth Social network to launch a fresh assault on the probity of the verdict he has vowed to appeal. \u201cThese are not legitimate trials; they are merely part of an illegal POLITICAL WITCH HUNT the likes of which our Country has never seen before!\u201d Trump wrote. The former president\u2019s sentencing has been set for July 11, just a few days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s sentencing is not expected to occur until October. Joe Biden, who has said he is trying to restore faith in the justice system after the Trump presidency, said in a solemn ABC News interview that he won\u2019t pardon his son. This is especially significant since Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, although a sentence for a first-time offender is unlikely to be that severe. First families in the spotlight While cameras were barred from the courtroom in both trials, each unfolded against a backdrop of taut political drama and the glare of publicity surrounding the former and current first families. The ex-president\u2019s adult sons Eric and Donald Jr. sometimes attended court in New York. And crowds of GOP lawmakers \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 were eager to embroider the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s claims that he was a victim of politicized justice in what amounts to an attack on the rule of law by a major American political party. Former first lady Melania Trump did not attend. Biden has stayed away from his son\u2019s trial in Wilmington, but first lady Jill Biden has led a gathering of the clan at the courthouse for the last week. She crossed the Atlantic four times last week, balancing her official role alongside her husband at D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations and in a state visit to France with her desire to be with her son in his hour of greatest need. In one striking moment in the trial\u2019s closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors drawn from a state where many families have a story about interacting with the Bidens that they should draw no inference from the first family\u2019s rock-solid bond and presence at the trial. \u201cPeople sitting in the gallery are not evidence. You may recognize them from the news \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d\u00a0Wise added: \u201cYour decision can only be made on evidence.\u201d The infringements on the Biden family\u2019s dignity and privacy cut deep during the trial, which saw discomforting testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s former cocaine addiction. Beau Biden\u2019s widow, Hallie, who had a relationship with Hunter as they grieved, testified about their joint cocaine use that she said now embarrasses and shames her. In a heart-rending scene, the accused\u2019s daughter, Naomi, was brought to the stand by the defense, then came under a rigorous cross-examination from prosecutors. The way addiction ravages loved ones as well as the user was laid bare when a text from Naomi to her father reading, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad, I can\u2019t take this,\u201d was introduced into evidence. Media organizations, meanwhile, played an excerpt from Hunter Biden\u2019s audio book that chronicles his spiral into addiction that was used in the prosecution case. Two politicized trials with critical differences Given the identities of those involved and the fraught national moment in the middle of a bitterly contested general election, there\u2019s no way the Trump and Hunter Biden trials could not have become politicized. Trump has claimed that he\u2019s the victim of a vendetta by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, though he was indicted by a grand jury, enjoyed the presumption of innocence like any other accused felon and was judged by a jury of his peers. When Biden\u2019s plea deal collapsed in the court of a Trump-appointed judge and when Attorney General Merrick Garland made David Weiss, the prosecutor investigating Biden, a special counsel, some Democrats asked whether Republican pressure designed to damage the president had weighed on the renewed push for a trial. But both trials have been conducted according to the rules of evidence and provided expansive protections for the accused. And the same bedrock American principle that was cited by prosecutors in the Trump hush money trial was used by Wise in his summation on Monday. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d he said, urging jurors not to treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d There is a critical difference between the two trials that debunks much of the political noise around them. Hunter Biden, unlike Trump, did not serve as president and has no chance of sitting in the Oval Office as commander in chief on January 20. While Biden is facing serious charges and will go on trial again in September in a separate tax case, his alleged offenses have nothing to do with the Constitution or threats to democracy. Trump\u2019s charges, however, focus on alleged mishandling of national security documents that he hoarded at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office. He has also been charged in two separate cases \u2014 one federal and one in Georgia \u2014 with the ultimate crime in a democracy: seeking to overturn the will of voters. The former president is waiting for a US Supreme Court ruling on his sweeping claims of immunity arising from the federal election interference case that, if the court rules his way and he wins a second term, could augur a presidency of almost no constraints that could verge on autocracy. The second distinction lies in the fact that Joe Biden\u2019s behavior is not an issue in the criminal cases against his son. And House Republicans have so far failed to find that the president benefited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals in nations like Ukraine and China while his father was vice president \u2014 even if the younger Biden\u2019s activity raises serious ethical questions.

Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney was given 30 days to appear and get his mug shot and fingerprints taken, according to a Maricopa County court commissioner, after a problematic attempt by agents within the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office to serve Giuliani last month. Giuliani was served on May 17\u00a0in Palm Beach, Florida, at his 80th\u00a0birthday bash held by a GOP operative. Arizona prosecutors spent weeks trying to track down the former New York City mayor and eventually found him based on his podcasts. Giuliani also posted a $10,000 bond in cash on Monday, according to court documents. A grand jury in Arizona\u00a0handed up indictments\u00a0last month charging over a dozen Trump allies, including the fake electors and several individuals connected to his campaign, over their efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. \u201cThis yet another example of partisan actors weaponizing the criminal justice system to interfere with the 2024 presidential election through outlandish charges against President Trump and anyone willing to take on the permanent Washington political class,\u201d said Ted Goodman, a spokesperson for Giuliani.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters", "text": "Hunter Biden has never sought elective office or been part of a presidential administration, but he has loomed large in the American political conversation for years. His conviction in Delaware, the first federal criminal trial of a president\u2019s son in US history, is for allegedly lying on a federal firearms background check and owning a firearm for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs and could land him behind bars. It has put a personal drama of addiction and betrayal in the public eye, an unwanted embarrassment for the Biden family. Read more from CNN\u2019s team covering the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, his brother\u2019s widow \u2013 with whom he had an affair \u2013 and his daughter all testified. Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction will also serve as a sort of foil for former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction for lying on business records in New York. That\u2019s not to equate the two sets of charges or the trials. Trump was convicted for hiding his compensation of hush money paid to keep an alleged affair out of the media during the 2016 presidential campaign. He is also running again in the 2024 presidential election, while Hunter Biden is now an artist. Hunter Biden also faces tax evasion charges in Los Angeles later this year, another case brought by the former Trump-appointed US attorney turned special counsel whose planned plea deal with Biden to settle both the gun and tax problems imploded last year when a Trump-appointed judge refused to accept it. Trump feared a Joe Biden candidacy ahead of the 2020 election, and hoping to tarnish Biden\u2019s reputation, in 2019 he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to spin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. Trump pushed Zelensky to focus on Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as vice president, at a time when Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. Joe Biden was one of many Western leaders who had advocated for the ouster of a prosecutor in Ukraine because he was not pursuing corruption cases. Read a CNN fact check about Trump\u2019s Ukraine claims. Democrats impeached Trump (the first of two times) for improperly dragging a foreign leader into US politics. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. But that bad experience did nothing to stop Trump or Republicans from making allegations about Hunter Biden. At the Republican presidential debate in 2020, Trump brought up Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and also alleged that he was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the Navy Reserve for cocaine use, which is not true. Hunter Biden was administratively discharged, which is standard procedure when an officer fails a drug test. Read a CNN fact check about the discharge claim. In fact, if you search \u201cHunter Biden\u201d in the CNN Facts First database, there are many results. Among them: Did Hunter Biden have a job before his father became vice president? Yes. Did Joe Biden profit from his son Hunter\u2019s career? There\u2019s no evidence. What is Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with China? He did business with Chinese partners. The sheer volume of these fact checks is worth noting as proof, if nothing else, that he is so frequently cited by his father\u2019s political opponents.  When Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives in January 2023, one of their high-profile moves was to launch an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, most of it built on trying to tie the president to his son\u2019s former business career. While House Republicans have referred Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden for criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading Congress, the impeachment inquiry has seemingly fallen apart without unanimous support from Republicans and no evidence of wrongdoing by the president. For Hunter Biden, his name is both a blessing and a curse. It was with help from his last name that he built a lucrative career as an attorney, then lobbyist, who then  did business with companies in Ukraine and China. It is because of his name that he has been so scrutinized. It is a trade-off Hunter Biden has been experiencing for years. When Joe Biden was tapped as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008, they made a point about not consorting with lobbyists. Hunter, then a lobbyist, ended his lucrative lobbying contracts a few months before the election that year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_trump-promises-supporters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump lately has dangled some very specific promises to his audiences. At a Las Vegas campaign rally on Sunday, for example, Trump pledged to exempt tips from income taxes, a proposal tailor-made for the hundreds of thousands of people working in America\u2019s tourism capital. Speaking at the Libertarian convention a couple weeks earlier, Trump vowed to put one of the party\u2019s own in his cabinet and more throughout his government if reelected to the White House \u2014 an assurance that briefly halted the cacophony of boos that confronted him there. And before that, Trump professed to Michigan autoworkers his plans to unravel President Joe Biden\u2019s policies supporting electric vehicles, insisting it will protect their livelihoods. As Trump goes around the country in search of new supporters, he is leaving behind explicit guarantees for voters to consider. Often, the target audience is a demographic his campaign has singled out for its potential to sway a race both sides expect will be won on the margins. Trump\u2019s pledge to end taxes on tips came on the same day his campaign announced Latino Americans for Trump, an initiative to mobilize one of the fastest-growing voting blocs in the country. In Nevada, one in four workers are employed by the hospitality industry and about one in five residents are Hispanic \u2013 with considerable overlap between the two groups. \u201cFor those hotel workers and people that get tips,\u00a0you\u2019re going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips,\u201d Trump said during the rally. A Republican presidential candidate hasn\u2019t won Nevada in two decades, and Latino\u00a0Americans voted 2-to-1 for Biden four years ago. But Trump\u2019s campaign has prioritized flipping Nevada and the Democratic Party\u2019s historical advantage in Latino communities, and polling suggests they have made progress on both fronts. For Trump, the transactional outreach is illustrative of a candidate whose penchant for dealmaking in the business world has informed his approach to politics. And it\u2019s a tactic he has also deployed to keep long-time supporters happy as well. Speaking at the National Rifle Association last month, Trump pledged to fire the country\u2019s top firearms regulator and said he would sign legislation forcing states to recognize a concealed carry permit from any jurisdiction. But his pitches have been met with criticism from his political opponents, who have accused the former president of pandering for votes, if not something more untoward. Senate Democrats recently launched an investigation after the Washington Post reported Trump had promised oil and energy executives at recent fundraisers that he would make it easier for them to operate if he won another turn in the White House. \u201cTime and time again, both Mr. Trump and the U.S. oil and gas industry have proved they are willing to sell out Americans to pad their own pockets,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and Senate Budget Committee Chair Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, wrote in a statement. And in a blistering statement, Culinary Workers Union Local 226, the powerful Nevada union representing the state\u2019s hospitality workers, assailed Trump\u2019s latest proposal on tips and taxes\u00a0as \u201cwild campaign promises from a convicted felon.\u201d Though Trump said he would \u201cnot charge taxes on tips\u201d when he gets into office, any change would require congressional approval. Trump\u2019s campaign confirmed the former president intends to seek a legislative change. \u201cPresident Trump will ask Congress to eliminate taxes on tips,\u201d spokesperson\u00a0Karoline Leavitt told CNN. \u201cJoe Biden has aggressively stepped up the IRS going after tip workers.\u201d The attempted outreach comes after Trump as president angered restaurant and hotel workers\u00a0by changing the rules to allow employers to determine how to distribute tips among employees. Most politicians make promises to win support. Biden\u2019s 2020 victory came on a pledge to forgive student loan debt, ban the commercial sale of military-style firearms and rescind Trump\u2019s travel ban from Muslim countries. (Biden has delivered on overturning Trump\u2019s Muslim travel policies and has moved unilaterally to erase some student loans after the Supreme Court blocked a more expansive forgiveness program, but he has not made headway on an assault weapons ban). Trump has published an entire website to host many of his proposals for a second term. They include a pledge to fund free online classes for all Americans with billions of dollars seized from private university endowments, plans to charter 10 new \u201cfreedom\u201d cities on federal land and calls for\u00a0police agencies to adopt controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policies or risk losing federal dollars. But Trump\u2019s history of latching onto causes when it suits his political objectives has made skeptics among some the former president is now attempting to persuade. Take wind energy, for example. At the start of his presidency, Trump\u2019s administration pursued an aggressive expansion of offshore wind farms as part of a broader push to \u201cunleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.\u201d But speaking in Wildwood, New Jersey, in May, Trump described wind farms as \u201chorrible\u201d and accused turbines of killing birds and whales. He said he would \u201cmake sure that ends on day one\u201d if reelected. The remarks effectively injected the former president directly into a local fight over the future of green energy in the Garden State\u00a0just as he said his campaign was making a play to turn the Democratic stronghold red. Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, called Trump a \u201ccharlatan grifter\u201d moments after the former president addressed his party\u2019s convention last month. In addition to offering administrative posts to Libertarians in his effort to win them over, Trump also promised convention attendees he would release Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the underground website Silk Road who is serving a life sentence in prison for facilitating $200 million in transactions for unlawful goods and services, including drugs linked to overdose deaths. In a 2015 news\u00a0release about his sentencing, the US Department of Justice said Ulbricht solicited six murders-for-hire while operating the site. Ulbricht has become a cause celebre of Libertarians, and \u201cFree Ross\u201d signs were omnipresent at last month\u2019s convention. Trump\u2019s promise to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence was met with raucous cheers. But Trump also has said drug traffickers should get the death penalty, and he declined during his first term to release Ulbricht, a point raised by many Libertarians in attendance that night. \u201cNow, make no mistake, I have no love for Joe Biden, but he didn\u2019t even think to come on this stage and pretend to be a Libertarian because he knows the truth: he isn\u2019t one,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cBut Donald Trump needs to know that message loud and clear.\u201d The room erupted in cheers. Still, Trump\u2019s outreach to unconventional audiences has forced Biden and Democrats to redouble their efforts with groups once considered a bedrock of party support. The president recently launched Black Voters for Biden-Harris in battlegrounds amid an increasingly urgent push to energize African Americans and stave off Trump\u2019s courtship of Black men. \u201cWhile we are busy putting in the work to earn Black America\u2019s support, Donald Trump continues to show just how ignorant he is,\u201d Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said. \u201cHosting janky rap concerts doesn\u2019t hide the fact that he lacks the resources and competence to genuinely engage our community.\u201d The inroads made by the former president with union households has created headwinds for Biden in Michigan, a state crucial to his chances of recapturing the White House. During a September rally in Detroit, Trump courted autoworkers by insisting electric vehicles would be made overseas and vowed to upend Biden administration efforts to help American car companies produce more of them. \u201cDo me a favor, just get your union guys, your leaders, to endorse me,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d United Auto Workers ultimately endorsed Biden, and its president, Shawn Fain, called Trump \u201ca scab.\u201d But a Fox News poll from April shows Biden leading Trump among union households in Michigan by\u00a0just 12 points\u00a0\u2013 a significant decline from his lead four years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/trump-promises-supporters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_merrick-garland-justice-department-attacks", "text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday that rising \u201cbaseless, personal and dangerous\u201d attacks on the Justice Department have become \u201cdangerous for our democracy.\u201d \u201cWe will not be intimidated by these attacks. But it is absurd and dangerous that public servants, many of whom risk their lives every day, are being threatened for simply doing their jobs and adhering to the principles that have long guided the Justice Department\u2019s work,\u201d Garland wrote in the op-ed. Continued unfounded attacks on the agency\u2019s employees, he added, \u201care dangerous for people\u2019s safety. They are dangerous for our democracy. This must stop.\u201d Garland\u2019s latest comments echo his forceful defense of the Justice Department before the House Judiciary Committee last week. While he didn\u2019t mention political parties in his op-ed Tuesday, Garland denounced a number of \u201dconspiracy theories\u201d floated by Republicans about the Justice Department being weaponized\u00a0against former President Donald Trump. \u201cThe Justice Department makes decisions about criminal investigations based only on the facts and the law. We do not investigate people because of their last name, their political affiliation, the size of their bank account, where they come from or what they look like. We investigate and prosecute violations of federal law \u2014 nothing more, nothing less,\u201d Garland said. The House Rules Committee will meet later Tuesday to consider recommending charges of contempt for the attorney general over his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden\u2019s handling of classified material and declined to bring charges. Garland said in his testimony last week that while the department will not provide the audio recordings sought by the GOP lawmakers, it has \u201cgone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the committee gets responses to its legitimate requests for information,\u201d including providing transcripts of the interview with Biden. The DOJ has argued that\u00a0the specific privacy concerns related to\u00a0an audio recording of an interview\u00a0are\u00a0distinct from those of a written transcript, and how the release of such an audio file could dissuade cooperation from future witnesses in criminal investigations.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_medical-debt-credit-reports-biden-ban", "text": "In its latest effort to minimize the impact of medical debt on consumers, the Biden administration proposed Tuesday banning such debt from credit reports. The move would remove medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, which would raise their credit scores by an average of 20 points and lead to the approval of about 22,000 more mortgages annually, according to a fact sheet from the office of Vice President Kamala Harris. It\u2019s one of the latest steps in the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to help people contend with higher costs of living as polls show voters are not pleased with President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. Some 46 million people had medical debt listed on their credit reports in 2020, according to the fact sheet. The proposed rule would also ban lenders from using medical devices, such as wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, as collateral for loans and bar them from repossessing the devices if patients are unable to repay the loans. The rule could be finalized early next year. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been considering proposals since last fall that would spare millions of Americans with unpaid medical bills from having that debt show up on credit reports. Creditors, who use these reports to make underwriting decisions when people apply for mortgages, car loans and other debt, would be able to use only nonmedical information in their evaluations. \u201cMedical debt makes it more difficult for millions of Americans to be approved for a car loan, a home loan or a small business loan, all of which in turn makes it more difficult to just get by, much less get ahead,\u201d Harris said on a call with reporters. \u201cAnd that is simply not fair, especially when we know that people with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those without medical debt.\u201d Also, debt collectors would no longer be able to use the listing of medical debt on credit reports as leverage to pressure consumers into paying questionable bills. Harris also called on states, localities and health care providers to take additional steps to eliminate medical debt, noting that $7 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funds are being used to wipe out the debt of up to nearly 3 million people by the end of 2026. Also, she asked them to expand access to charity care to minimize the accumulation of debt and to protect patients from aggressive debt collectors. Big burden There are varying estimates on just how many people have medical debt, but it\u2019s a sizable share of the population. In recent years, medical bills have become the most common collection item on credit reports, Rohit Chopra, the bureau\u2019s director, said on a call with reporters. Some 15 million Americans have a total of more than $49 billion in medical debt in collections, according to an April report from the bureau. That\u2019s down from the $88 billion the bureau reported in March 2022, after which the three nationwide credit reporting agencies announced they would no longer include certain medical debt on reports. Many health care bills contain mistakes, which can lead to extended battles among those in debt, health insurers and medical providers. \u201cOftentimes, we see this everywhere, people give up and pay a bill they don\u2019t actually owe just to get some peace of mind and to move on with their lives,\u201d Chopra said. Medical debt also hits the middle class particularly hard, according to a 2023 report from Third Way, a center-left think tank. Although these folks are more likely to have better health insurance coverage than lower-income Americans, the middle class is less likely to avoid care because of the cost but also less likely to qualify for financial assistance. At the same time, the middle class is less likely than higher-income Americans to have enough disposable funds to cover steep deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Almost a quarter of middle-class Americans, or 17 million people, had unpaid health care bills in 2020, according to Third Way. That compares with 22% of lower-income Americans and just under 13% of higher-income people, according to the report, which is based on US Census Bureau data. White House efforts The White House has\u00a0sought to lessen Americans\u2019 medical debt burden\u00a0as part of its effort to help people contend with inflation and higher costs of living. In 2022, it laid out a four-point plan to help protect consumers, including having the bureau investigate credit reporting companies and debt collectors that violate patients\u2019 and families\u2019 rights. Also in 2022, the three largest credit reporting agencies \u2013 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2013 announced they would remove nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports. The agencies no longer include medical debt that went to collections on consumer credit reports once it has been paid off. That eliminated billions of dollars of debt on consumer records. In addition, unpaid medical collection debt no longer appears on credit reports for the first year, whereas the previous grace period was six months. That gives people more time to work with their health insurers or providers to address the bills. And medical collection debt of less than $500 is no longer included on credit reports.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/medical-debt-credit-reports-biden-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_trump-european-union-elections-analysis", "text": "In June 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union in a populist revolt that foreshadowed Donald Trump\u2019s shock outsider election win a few months later. Now, in June 2024, far-right candidates, many of whom share Trump\u2019s populist nationalism, hostility to immigrants, searing economic message, and disdain for governing elites and globalist institutions, just won sweeping gains in EU elections. Is political lightning about to strike twice? US voters don\u2019t take direction from foreigners, and American presidential elections, which play out state by state, are far different from those for the European Union. Plus, Trump\u2019s win eight years ago had more to do with the deficiencies of Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign than Brexit. But President Joe Biden should be concerned. The latest campaign in Europe successfully road-tested a message that mixes a potent political cocktail \u2014 public anger over what is perceived to be out-of-control migration, the pain of voters facing high prices and the cost to individuals of fighting climate change. Trump is hitting these themes hard in battleground states that will decide the White House race. Another lesson of the European elections is that in an age of inflation, incumbents are vulnerable to a disgruntled electorate. When Biden arrives at the G7 summit in Italy this week, he\u2019ll join a quartet of four other politically diminished Western leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are smarting from their rebuke in European elections that rewarded far-right parties that echo the continent\u2019s dark past. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s low approval ratings mean he might not even lead his Liberal Party into elections due by the end of next year. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to be wiped out in next month\u2019s general election after 14 years of Conservative rule. Ironically, the most secure European leader at the G7 will be Giorgia Meloni, the right-wing prime minister of Italy, a country known for dispensing with leaders at a hectic rate. Meloni\u2019s party won big over the weekend, making her one of the most powerful leaders on the other side of the Atlantic. A saving grace for Biden might be that the US election is not a traditional face-off between an insurgent outsider and an unpopular sitting president. Trump is, in many ways, an incumbent himself who boasts a controversial White House legacy and carries heavy political baggage as a twice-impeached and convicted former president. And populist nationalism isn\u2019t on the rise everywhere. Biden led a surprisingly successful midterm election campaign against \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d influences in the GOP in 2022. An expected return to power by the Labour Party in Britain next month would buck the trend of ascendant right-wing parties. And Poland just rejected eight years of populist rule that drew inspiration from Trump. Macron reacted to the surge of the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen with a bold gambit that stunned commentators watching his post-election speech in TV studios. He dissolved Parliament and called new elections. The National Rally is an evolution of the ultra-right-wing anti-immigrant National Front, which has never managed to navigate the country\u2019s two-round electoral system to win the presidency. Le Pen has now moderated some policies to appeal to a broader group of voters. Macron, who heads a centrist party that was routed in the European elections, may be betting that the higher turnout in legislative elections could reverse the trend. A post-election anti-far-right coalition could also emerge in Parliament. But if the National Rally wins the two-part elections that culminate weeks before the Paris Olympics, Macron may be forced to appoint 28-year-old far-right star Jordan Bardella as prime minister in an awkward cohabitation deal. Cynics wonder whether Macron secretly hopes that a far-right government could be so disastrous that it could tarnish Le Pen\u2019s hopes of succeeding him in 2027. Macron told voters his gamble was based on trust \u201cin the capacity of the French people to make the most just choice for themselves and for future generations.\u201d He\u2019s implicitly beseeching voters despondent about the economy to save the foundational values of their country, billing his announcement as an act of \u201ctrust in our democracy.\u201d That\u2019s rather similar to the warning that American democracy is in deep peril and needs to be saved by voters, which Biden spelled out at Macron\u2019s side last week during the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day Normandy landings. That\u2019s why the White House will be watching French election results on July 7 even more closely than Sunday\u2019s EU contests.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/trump-european-union-elections-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_bob-menendez-bribery-trial", "text": "For more than four weeks, Sen. Bob Menendez has been a mostly peripheral figure at his bribery and corruption trial. On Monday, at federal court in Lower Manhattan, the New Jersey Democrat became the main character. Prosecutors\u2019 star witness, businessman Jose Uribe, told the jury for the first time that Menendez helped drive the wider conspiracy that ensnared the senator; his wife, Nadine Menendez; and two co-defendants. In his testimony, Uribe, who pleaded guilty before the trial began and is cooperating with prosecutors, described Menendez as a Godfather-like character who lorded his power over others and, by his deeds and demeanor, appeared to many as an all-powerful figure with vast influence in all walks of life. Menendez, in Uribe\u2019s telling, rarely asked any questions and provided only a blinkered view into his plans and actions. But months after allegedly delivering on the key pieces of the bribery scheme, Menendez, during a 2020\u00a0dinner with Uribe, sat back, his hands crossed over his stomach, and reminded the businessman of all he\u2019d done. \u201cI saved your a** twice. Not once, but twice,\u201d Menendez told him in Spanish, Uribe testified. Nadine and her adult daughter, who were also at the dinner, had just excused themselves to use the bathroom. Before they returned, the senator bragged that it had not been difficult work, but Uribe said his body language suggested that \u201che was proud and confident that he got this done.\u201d Uribe, who first took the stand on Friday, described a series of meetings with Bob and Nadine Menendez as he sought the senator\u2019s help in quashing the prosecution of an associate and a state investigation that he feared would ultimately lead back to his businesses and the close friends who nominally ran them. Those concerns, Uribe said, led him to leverage his relationship with Nadine Menendez \u2013 most notably the Mercedes-Benz convertible he purchased for her \u2013 into audiences with the senator and, eventually, the interventions that led to the Menendezes being charged with conspiring to accept gold bars, bricks of cash and a swishy car in exchange for an assortment of political and legal favors. (Nadine Menendez, who is being treated for breast cancer, is being tried separately, likely in July.) Lawyers for Bob Menendez have sought to portray him as an afterthought in the matter. In their opening arguments, they urged the jury to consider the question \u201cWhere\u2019s Bob?\u201d \u2013 asserting that he was either unaware or not involved in the machinations alleged by prosecutors. It was his then-girlfriend Nadine driving the bus, they said, with the senator evincing only a partial, passive awareness of her actions. Uribe told a different story. In one meeting on the patio in Nadine\u2019s backyard in September 2019, the night before Menendez met with New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Uribe said the senator asked him to write down the names of the people and businesses at the heart of Uribe\u2019s \u201cworries.\u201d In Uribe\u2019s telling, after a brief chat, Menendez called out \u201cmon amour\u201d to Nadine, who was inside the home, while ringing a little bell set up on their backyard table. Nadine emerged with paper and disappeared back inside before Uribe began to write. The senator did not offer much information in return, Uribe said. The next morning, Uribe texted Nadine \u2013 according to phone records \u2013 thanking her \u201cfor everything you do for me\u201d and saying he was \u201cpraying today\u2019s meeting is in GOD\u2019s hand.\u201d Uribe said he did not know, even then, with whom Menendez would be sitting down. Hours later, though, he received another message from Nadine, this time asking him to meet the senator at Menendez\u2019s New Jersey apartment building. (The couple was not yet married and kept separate residences.) Uribe recalled entering to see Menendez chatting in the lobby with a receptionist. The two then walked toward a quieter corner and began to chat. \u201cThe thing you asked me about, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there,\u201d Menendez said, according to Uribe, who took it to mean that, while nothing was formally settled, he should no longer be concerned about a probe into his businesses or associates. Uribe said he left optimistic but unsettled. He had come through for Nadine, buying her a new car after she had totaled her old one in a fatal accident \u2013 a detail that has not been disclosed to the jury \u2013 and was desperate for her to help him \u201cstop and kill\u201d his looming legal troubles. \u201cPeace,\u201d as Uribe described it, came in time. About eight weeks later, he received a phone call at his home from a 202 area code \u2013 from Washington, DC. Menendez was on the other line, Uribe said, and told him the good news. \u201cThat thing you asked me about, there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Menendez told him. \u201cI give you your \u2018peace.\u2019\u201d Uribe became emotional as he spoke about the call. His work had come good. His fears were vanquished \u2013 all thanks, he said, to Bob Menendez. He texted Nadine, \u201cI got a call and I am a very happy person.\u201d \u201cGOD bless you and him for ever,\u201d she replied. Days later, Uribe and an associate met with the couple\u00a0at a local restaurant. Prosecutors showed the court a picture of the foursome smiling widely with champagne glasses raised \u2013 the bubbly had been sent to their table by other diners. One cause for celebration, Uribe said, went unspoken. Instead, they toasted the engagement of Nadine and Bob, who would get married in 2020. \u201cIt was the right place to be that day,\u201d an emotional Uribe told the court. Their gatherings slowed when the Covid-19 pandemic hit a few months later. The dinner when Menendez crowed about taking care of Uribe would not happen until August 2020, when they met to eat outside. Nearly two years would then pass with Uribe keeping in touch with the Menendezes as he tried to finagle a new insurance broker\u2019s license. His first one had been voided as part of a separate criminal probe years earlier. Not much came of those efforts, he said Monday, apart from a dead-end introduction. Uribe said he learned about the investigation that ultimately led him to plead guilty and testify against the senator in June 2022, when FBI agents turned up at his home, took his cell phone and handed him \u201csubpoenas\u201d for assorted documents and records largely related to his payments on Nadine Menendez\u2019s Mercedes. Nadine Menendez and Uribe would meet one more time \u2013 at a Marriott hotel bar in New Jersey, the same place Uribe and two associates first hatched the plan at the offering of Wael Hana. The Egyptian American businessman \u2013 a co-defendant in this case \u2013 told them he could parlay his own friendship with Nadine Menendez into assistance from the senator. It would, Hana allegedly said, cost between $200,000 and $250,000. During their 2022 chat, Nadine Menendez and Uribe shared notes on the federal probe. She asked him, he said, what he planned to tell the FBI about the car payments. Uribe told her he planned to say he was helping a friend and expected to be repaid. Nadine Menendez approved of the plan, he said. The payments would be retconned as a loan. She mailed his lawyer a check for $21,000, considerably less than what he had spent on the Mercedes. How, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz asked, did she arrive at that figure? \u201cNo idea,\u201d Uribe said. It was the last time they spoke.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/bob-menendez-bribery-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-hunter-biden-gun-violence-speech", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday heralded the steps his administration has taken to strengthen the country\u2019s gun laws and enhance the penalties for those who violate them, in what was an awkward political moment for a man whose son had been convicted just hours earlier on federal gun charges. Speaking at an Everytown for Gun Safety event under a banner that read \u201cGun Sense University\u201d in large block letters, the president did not reference his son\u2019s conviction. Hunter Biden was pronounced guilty earlier in the day of three felony charges after a jury found he lied on a form by saying he was not abusing drugs when he purchased a firearm in 2018. Instead,\u00a0speaking as someone who has had two children die prematurely,\u00a0he spent much of his remarks reflecting on personal loss\u00a0and saying\u00a0that he empathized with those in the audience who have lost loved ones to gun violence. \u201cNever give up on hope,\u201d the president told the audience. While Biden did not reference his son\u2019s conviction on stage Tuesday afternoon, it was sure to be at the top of his mind. Biden is known to be passionately defensive of his family and sensitive to outside criticism of his son\u2019s troubled history. The president rearranged his schedule to leave directly from the gun-safety event for Wilmington, where his son remains after the jury there convicted him. The White House cancelled a previously scheduled press briefing that was to take place Tuesday afternoon. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timing of Biden\u2019s address and his son\u2019s federal trial Tuesday morning. While Biden has largely avoided commenting on his son\u2019s trial - he said in an interview last week that he would respect the trial\u2019s outcome and would not pardon his son - the outcome of the jury\u2019s verdict is sure to be at the top of his mind on Tuesday. The president is known to be passionately defensive of his family and sensitive to outside criticism of his son\u2019s troubled history. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d Biden said in a statement following the verdict. \u201cSo many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The painful moment for the Biden family comes a day before\u00a0President Biden is expected to leave for a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The fluke of scheduling speaks to the balance Biden has been forced to strike throughout his son\u2019s legal proceedings. As the trial was underway last week, Biden was in France commemorating D-Day. Aides said the president was keeping track of the trial from overseas, and remained in touch with his son and first lady Dr. Jill Biden, who had returned to Delaware to attend the trial for one day. Before and after that trip, Biden spent a sizable amount of time with Hunter in Delaware. He returned from France directly to the family home in Wilmington. He\u2019ll attempt to put the personal drama on the back-burner while he talks about gun violence, a topic that he views as key to his political life. As a senator, the president helped get an assault weapons ban passed through Congress in the 1990s and has promised to do so again. He also frequently touts signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was the first significant gun safety legislation in a quarter-century when it was passed. That act, which was signed into law by Biden almost two years ago, was created in the wake of massacres at a Texas elementary school and a New York supermarket. It established new criminal offenses for the straw-purchasing of firearms by buyers who lie about the gun\u2019s intended owner, among other provisions. \u201cIt\u2019s the most significant gun legislation in nearly 30 years, and we passed it only because you got out and worked like hell to get it done,\u201d Biden said Tuesday. \u201cI may have had the idea, but you got it made, you made it happen. It was designed to reduce gun violence and save lives, and I\u2019m so proud of the tremendous progress we\u2019ve made since then.\u201d Absent from Biden\u2019s comments Tuesday, however, was an announcement that the Department of Justice had brought more than 500 new gun charges using statutes under the bipartisan gun law. The White House had previewed the announcement to reporters ahead of the speech, but Biden instead opted to more broadly focus on it. The White House declined to comment on why the reference to the volume of prosecutions did not appear in the speech, pointing to the overarching message in the address. \u201cThe President highlighted the progress his Administration has made reducing crime and getting illegal guns off our streets,\u201d a White House spokesperson told CNN. Biden has pushed for universal background checks of gun purchases, increased red-flag laws that allow law enforcement to confiscate guns from those deemed a threat to safety, and a ban on assault weapons. He has said he would make those efforts a priority if he were to attain a second term. But most of those policies would include congressional cooperation, and gun control remains one of the most divisive and intractable topics in American politics. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has promised to roll back any gun-control advancements made during Biden\u2019s term. Addressing the NRA convention in May, Trump said the rights of gun owners were \u201cunder siege\u201d and urged them to vote in November. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed over and over this year that Iran was so impoverished because of his policies as president that it did not provide any money to terror groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. \u201cIran was, as you know, they were broke. They weren\u2019t funding Hamas, and they weren\u2019t funding anything. They weren\u2019t funding Hezbollah,\u201d Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May interview with right-wing host Dan Bongino. In a June interview with Phil McGraw, the personality known as Dr. Phil, Trump\u00a0claimed Hamas would have never perpetrated its October attack on Israel if he had still been president, \u201cbecause Iran was broke and Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hamas and they weren\u2019t funding any of the terrorists \u2013 Hezbollah, all of them,\u00a0there\u2019s like 28 of them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hezbollah, Hamas or any other terror group during his presidency is false. Iran\u2019s funding for such groups\u00a0did\u00a0decline\u00a0in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his\u00a0sanctions\u00a0on Iran had a\u00a0major negative impact\u00a0on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN this week. Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah.\u00a0 Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups\u00a0(though it\u2019s\u00a0unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his\u00a0years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements. Pompeo said Iran continued to fund terror in 2020. Experts agree Research institutions in the US and Israel have reported that Iran\u2019s financial relationship with Hamas\u00a0actually\u00a0grew\u00a0stronger\u00a0in 2017, the first calendar year of Trump\u2019s presidency, after several years of frostiness related to divisions between Tehran and Hamas over the war in Syria. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in\u00a0late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d But\u00a0Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. \u201cSo you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically \u2013 continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,\u201d Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a\u00a0transcript posted on the State Department\u2019s website. Earlier that week, during a visit to Israel, Pompeo\u00a0told reporters\u00a0that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to limit the money the Iranian regime has available to inflict harm around the world \u201chas borne fruit, it has been successful,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay at it. There is still work to do on that file as well.\u201d He said, \u201cEven during this pandemic, the Iranians [are] using the ayatollahs\u2019, the regime\u2019s, resources to foment terror across the world\u00a0even when the people of Iran are struggling so mightily.\u201d Four experts told CNN this week that Iran\u2019s funding for Hezbollah and Hamas never vanished under Trump. \u201cIt absolutely did not and has not,\u201d said\u00a0Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cDefinitely it didn\u2019t stop. It decreased, yes,\u201d said\u00a0Hanin Ghaddar, senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cI would say it slowed down, but it never stopped entirely,\u201d said\u00a0Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group. \u201cIran has never ceased funding many of its core proxy groups\u201d such as Hezbollah, said\u00a0Phillip Smyth, who\u00a0studies Iran\u2019s proxies. \u201cThey are hyper-focused on continuing these relationships and proxy building efforts. However, sanctions do take a toll on some of their operations/abilities to build proxies.\u201d A funding cut, but funding continued Iran does not disclose how much money it gives to Hezbollah, Hamas and other foreign armed groups. Brian Hook, who served as the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran under Trump,\u00a0claimed\u00a0in 2019 that Iran \u201chas provided Hezbollah almost $700 million annually and gave more than $100 million a year to Palestinian terrorist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\u201d Hook\u00a0declined in June 2020\u00a0to publicly say how much less money Iran was spending on foreign activities than it had before Trump launched the pressure campaign, but he pointedly noted media reports about Iranian proxies receiving less than they had before.\u00a0Pompeo also\u00a0touted this reduction\u00a0in August 2020. In 2019, The Washington Post\u00a0published an in-depth report\u00a0explaining that, because Iran\u2019s financial situation had been worsened by Trump policy, Hezbollah had \u201cseen a sharp fall in its revenue and is being forced to make draconian cuts to its spending, according to Hezbollah officials, members and supporters.\u201d Reuters\u00a0published a report in 2020\u00a0about how Iran had slashed its payments to Shiite militia groups in Iraq because of the impact of the US sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Iran reduced its publicly disclosed military budget under Trump. The\u00a0Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which monitors countries\u2019 military spending,\u00a0reported\u00a0that Iranian military spending declined 20% between 2018 and 2020. Still, there\u2019s no doubt Iran\u2019s unspecified spending on foreign armed groups continued to some significant extent even after these cuts. The State Department\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0on international terrorism in 2020 made clear that Iranian support for terror entities endured in the last calendar year of Trump\u2019s term. \u201cIran continued to support acts of terrorism regionally and globally during 2020. Regionally, Iran supported proxies and partner groups in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, including Hizballah and Hamas,\u201d the report, released in 2021, said. \u201cSenior (al Qaeda) leaders continued to reside in Iran and facilitate terrorist operations from there. Globally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force remained the primary Iranian actors involved in supporting terrorist recruitment, financing, and plots across Europe, Africa, and Asia, and both Americas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_sport_cricket-united-states-changing-world", "text": "Call it the Miracle on Grass. A national cricket team that most Americans didn\u2019t even know they had beat one of the sport\u2019s global powers Pakistan, for whom the game is a national obsession. The triumph Thursday in the T20 World Cup \u2013 a global tournament using a shortened, three-hour version of a game that can last five days and still end in a draw \u2013 shocked the cricketing world. Cricket briefly flickered into US consciousness as the result popped up on news sites in a rare moment for a sport that lives in obscurity in the United States outside the South Asian and Caribbean communities. \u201cBeating Pakistan in the World Cup is going to open many doors for us,\u201d said USA Cricket captain Monank Patel in Texas, where the game took place in a converted minor league baseball park. Corey Anderson, who represented New Zealand internationally and now plays for the US team, told CNN he got hundreds of text messages after the win. \u201cIt\u2019s probably shocked the cricketing world,\u201d said the 33-year-old who has an American wife and kids. \u201cI know definitely here in the US it\u2019s been a lot of media coverage, which is fantastic. I think USA Cricket is just not that well known within America, and I think we put ourselves a little bit more on the map.\u201d Cricket faces huge barriers to becoming anything more than a curiosity to most Americans. But the US victory over Pakistan is exactly what global cricket chiefs hoped for when bringing some of this year\u2019s T20 World Cup to the United States, which is co-hosting along with islands in the Caribbean, a more traditional hotbed of the game that has faced challenges from the encroachment of US sports. In the biggest game ever on US soil, more than 30,000 fans will Sunday pack into towering bleachers in a temporary stadium that materialized out of nowhere in a Long Island, New York, park to watch India play Pakistan. Tickets are selling for $700 on the secondary market. The global TV audience could at least double the 124 million who tuned into the Super Bowl this year. Peter Della Penna, an American journalist and broadcaster who covers cricket in this country after falling for the game during a college exchange stint in Australia, was stunned when he saw the new infrastructure on Long Island. \u201cThey had a recreational cricket field, but it was basically just a community park,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see what was there when I got there was quite extraordinary. Talking to the residents and the community, they are taken aback.\u201d America\u2019s most famous cricket victory on Thursday tells a story about the changing demographic mix in the United States. Cricket\u2019s new Field of Dreams in Nassau County is testimony to a dynamic and highly educated South Asian community that is becoming increasingly prosperous and connected in US business and society and politically more important. It\u2019s no coincidence that former President Donald Trump appeared alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before around 100,000 people at a rally at the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad in 2020. He wanted to woo a slice of the electorate back home. \u201cThe diaspora is sizable, and they clearly have connections to\u00a0(India) \u2026 the most populous nation in the world,\u201d said Simon Chadwick, a professor specializing in the geopolitical economy of sport at SKEMA, a global business school. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a large diaspora, a large country. You\u2019ve got a sport that has proved to be commercially incredibly successful. You got have investors, not just from the United States or from the Gulf region, hungry for potential commercial opportunities and willing to take a punt.\u201d How cricket mirrors a revolution in global sports The T20 World Cup games in the United States also reflect one of the most dynamic new realities in the multi-billion-dollar market of global sports. This is the shift in power away from traditional sports administrators and marketplaces like the United Kingdom and Europe to rising countries in the Middle East and South Asia. Cricket was spread around the globe by colonialists at a time when the sun never used to set on the British Empire. It\u2019s still most popular in nations the British used to rule, like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, \ufeffNew Zealand and Australia. Its premier international contest is the Ashes, a series of five-day contests that span the summer between England and Australia that date back to 1877 and take place twice every four years, once in each nation. But the balance of power in cricket has now shifted to India because of its massive television market and the emerging middle class in a nation with a billion people. The Indian Premier League, an annual short-form tournament that draws the world\u2019s top players with huge salaries, is transforming the game in a way that alienates many traditionalists and has spawned a series of spin-off franchise leagues \u2014 including the fledging Major League Cricket in the US that debuted last year with games in Texas and North Carolina. Indian cricketers, especially the batting legend Virat Kohli, are megastars back home and the strong viewership of the IPL among US fans built a rationale to bring World Cup games to America. The transformation of cricket parallels the growing power of soccer\u2019s new elites like the United Arab Emirates, which is the majority owner of Manchester City, and Qatar, which bankrolls Paris Saint-Germain. Middle Eastern money has flowed into Formula One, which \u2013 like cricket \u2013 is expanding in the US. Saudi Arabia is behind a split in professional golf after buying up top players with its LIV golf league. Cricket will become an Olympic sport in Los Angeles in 2028 partly because Modi, a just reelected Hindu nationalist, leveraged India\u2019s growing international clout to get it included. The internationalization of sports finance is not universally welcome. Some critics dismiss investments by Middle Eastern nations and events like the FIFA World Cup in Qatar or the Beijing Olympics as \u201csports washing\u201d \u2014 a way for authoritarian nations to clean up their images abroad. But it also reflects how developing nations are changing world\u2019s balance of economic and political power and, in some cases, are eclipsing their former colonial rulers. \u201cThere is this pivot from global north to global south,\u201d said Chadwick. \u201cAnd this pivot is evident not just in cricket or sports, but obviously in economic and political affairs, generally.\u201d What is cricket? Cricket is a game of bat-and-ball with distant similarities to baseball. Batters stand before a wicket \u2013 three vertical wooden poles stuck in the ground at either end of a strip of tightly mown grass called a pitch \u2013 that is a bit like a strike zone. Bowlers, who can reach speeds of 90 mph or more \u2013 and slower specialists called spinners who exert revolutions on the hard cricket ball with a flick of the wrist or a snap of the fingers \u2013 deliver the ball with a straight arm hurl. The ball must bounce on the pitch before it reaches the batter, allowing skilled bowlers to create deviations off a surface that becomes more receptive as it gets scuffed up. Runs are scored by batters running between the wickets. If a ball is hit out of the playing area with the flat faced wooden bat along the ground, the batting team gets four runs. If it goes into the stands on the fly, it\u2019s six runs \u2013 the equivalent of a home run. The bowling side records outs either by hitting the stumps with the ball or by rapping the batter on the leg pad in front of them in a dismissal known as leg before wicket or LBW. The bowling team can also get outs \u2013 also confusingly known as wickets \u2013 when close catchers or outfielders catch the ball before it bounces or by using it to knock down the stumps if a batter is running between them. Each team has 10 outs in an inning and the winning side is the one that gets the most runs. The match is divided into units called overs \u2013 groups of six balls delivered by one bowler. The T20 format is played over 20 overs. There\u2019s a day-long version of the game over 50 overs. The most exalted form of cricket is the Test Match. These games are limited by time and not overs and play out like a long Shakespearean drama in five six-hour days in a row and include two innings per team. Test matches have waned in popularity in some countries as life speeds up and attention spans wane. But they are still popular in places like England and Australia. In the 1932-33 season Down Under, the two nations came close to breaking off diplomatic relations because of a dispute over \u201cBodyline\u201d tactics pioneered by the England team \u2013 the bowling of fast short-pitched deliveries at a batter\u2019s head designed to thwart Australian phenom Donald Bradman, the Michael Jordan of his day. The first ever international cricket match was in the US but can the game catch on here? Cricket has a long history in this country. The first ever international fixture was between the United States and Canada in 1844 in New York. But baseball soon superseded cricket in the US. The game however is becoming increasingly visible. There are hundreds of club teams, and it is no longer unusual to see games in public parks in big US cities with teams mostly drawn from Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi communities. Elite US cricket is dominated by players of South Asian or Caribbean descent. The bowler in the super over \u2013 overtime play after the match against Pakistan \u2013 was Saurabh Netravalkar, a left-arm fast bowler who played Under-19s for India and now works in the tech industry in California. Milind Kumar, the outfielder who pulled off a spectacular catch (cricketers use their bare hands not mitts) was born in New Delhi. The question now is whether the USA\u2019s stunning win will trigger a rush of interest from outside the South Asian diaspora. The obstacles are huge. Most Americans couldn\u2019t watch Thursday\u2019s game even if they\u2019d have known it was on. The World Cup is being carried in the US on Willow TV, a streaming service that is also available on cable systems for an extra fee. It\u2019s tough for foreign sports to break into the idiosyncratic US market as established sports are bedded in popular culture, local communities and the rhythm of the seasons. The global game, soccer, has several times hubristically tried to conquer the US and it\u2019s taken years to reach its current level with strong pro leagues the MLS and the NWSL. But NBC\u2019s coverage of England\u2019s Premier League has broadened the game\u2019s appeal. It\u2019s not unusual now to see a Manchester United or Arsenal game on TV at college football tailgates in the Deep South on Saturday mornings. But considering almost every American kid plays soccer, the game ought to be bigger than it is. The wildly successful US Women\u2019s National Team might be a model for USA Cricket as it seeks to get girls involved. The best thing that could happen for America\u2019s cricketers would be a prolonged run at the 2028 Olympics that could catch the public\u2019s attention on national TV. The Olympics, and the national pride that comes with winning medals could also help cricket expand far beyond its current geographic footprint. \u201cInevitably, you have countries like the United States, China, and others that as far as possible, try to enter teams or athletes into medal winning sports,\u201d said Chadwick, who was speaking from Belgium. \u201cI think this transition from being a colonial pastime to being a medal winning Olympic sport is a game changer. It\u2019s a predictor of a likely increasing engagement with cricket around the world.\u201d But the game\u2019s growth in the US will be hampered by the lack of school or community cricket for kids and no path to the currently impossible dream of the sport being played in colleges. And the women\u2019s game is starting from a tiny base. Only about 400 of the 200,000 registered players in the US are female. \u201cYou can look at this event in two ways, depending on how you define success,\u201d said Della Penna, mentioning good World Cup ticket sales to South Asian expatriates and fans originating from Commonwealth nations. But there are high cultural and economic barriers to entry for other Americans to a sport that requires expensive equipment and coaching. \u201cIf you\u2019re defining success by a measure of what kind of legacy will be left behind after the circus leaves town, you\u2019re not going to find much success because you\u2019re not seeing kids play,\u201d Della Penna said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/sport/cricket-united-states-changing-world/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_us-intelligence-houthis-al-shabaab", "text": "US intelligence has learned of discussions between Houthis in Yemen to provide weapons to the Somali militant group\u00a0al-Shabaab, in what three American officials described to CNN as a worrying\u00a0development that threatens to further destabilize\u00a0an already violent region. Officials are now\u00a0searching for evidence that Houthi weapons have been delivered to Somalia, and are\u00a0trying to work out whether Iran, which provides some military and financial support to the Houthis, is involved in the agreement. The US has been warning countries in the region about this possible cooperation in recent weeks, according to a senior administration official, and African countries have also begun to proactively bring it up with the US to raise their concerns and get more information. \u201cThis is a pretty active area of conversation that we\u2019re having with countries on both sides of the Red Sea,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s being viewed with a considerable seriousness.\u201d It\u2019s not a natural alliance for the two groups, which are\u00a0divided by sectarianismand are not known to have had a relationship in the past.\u00a0The Houthis are Zaydi Shiites, and al-Shabaab traditionally has been deeply ideologically opposed to Shiism.\u00a0But they are separated by only a single\u00a0body of water \u2014 the strategically significant Gulf of Aden \u2014\u00a0and they\u00a0both count the United States as a top enemy. The intelligence raises the alarming possibility that a marriage of convenience could make things worse\u00a0both in Somalia and in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where the Houthis have launched regular attacks on commercial shipping and US military assets since the war in Gaza began. A potential deal could offer a new stream of financing for the Houthis,\u00a0at a time when US officials say there are signs that the group\u2019s primary patron, Iran,\u00a0has some concerns\u00a0about the group\u2019s attack strategy. \u201cBeing able to sell some weapons would bring them much needed income,\u201d the senior administration official said. For\u00a0al-Shabaab, it could provide access to a\u00a0new\u00a0source of weapons \u2014\u00a0including potentially drones \u2014\u00a0that are far more sophisticated than their current arsenal\u00a0and could offer the group the ability to strike US targets. There has been some routine smuggling\u00a0of\u00a0both small arms and commercial material between different groups in Yemen and Somalia for years. But a weapons\u00a0agreement between\u00a0al-Shabaab\u00a0and the Houthis would be something new, according to US officials. \u201cIt would be the clearest sign that two organizations that are, ideologically, diametrically opposed to one another \u2014 that they prioritized something they have in common, which is hostility towards [the United States],\u201d said Christopher Anzalone, a professor at the Marine Corps University\u2019s Middle East Studies department. \u201cIt would be very significant because it shows there is a level of pragmatism in\u00a0both organizations.\u201d Any form of military cooperation between the Houthis and al-Shabaab could also undermine an informal, and fragile, ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia that has held since 2022, the senior administration official said. And it would \u201cdefinitely\u201d go against the spirit of a proposed UN roadmap for a more lasting peace, the official said. \u201cWe still have a strong interest in supporting the roadmap process in Yemen,\u201d the official added, \u201cbut this sort of trafficking between the Houthis\u201d and al-Shabaab \u201cwould certainly complicate and undermine that effort.\u201d Officials say at this point, they aren\u2019t sure what kinds of weapons the Houthis might provide to\u00a0al-Shabaab. Right now, the Somali group generally only has access to rockets, mortars and homemade IEDs that it has used in its fight against the Somali government \u2014\u00a0deadly, but relatively smaller arms. The Houthis, by comparison, have weaponized drones, including\u00a0underwater drones. They also have short-range ballistic missiles. There is a sense that the deal would cover \u201cbigger kit\u201d than just rockets and mortars, said one US official, but beyond that, the intelligence is murky. No matter what the Houthis provide, there\u2019s likely limited opportunity for\u00a0al-Shabaab\u00a0to fire directly at US assets in the region. Even if the Houthis were to provide them with some of the smaller missiles the group has used to target US MQ-9 drones, Anzalone said,\u00a0al-Shabaab\u00a0would likely have to fire them from the north of the country. Pockets of that region of the country are controlled by an increasingly powerful branch of ISIS.\u00a0Al-Shabaab\u00a0is often fighting to contest territory there, and as a result, has a much more limited presence and freedom to maneuver. \u201cThey would love to do that,\u201d Anzalone said, referring to striking directly at US assets.\u00a0Al-Shabaab\u00a0views the internationally recognized government of Somalia as a puppet of the United States. But, he said, \u201cI think they would find it hard to do. This is where the intra-jihadist fighting between\u00a0Shabaab\u00a0and ISIS is the heaviest.\u201d The US has about 480 US troops in Somalia, according to a US official.\u00a0The US has continued to carry out counterterrorism strikes against\u00a0both\u00a0al-Shabaab\u00a0and ISIS targets in Somalia throughout the Biden administration. One major question for US intelligence officials is the degree of involvement Iran might have in the arrangement. There is no direct evidence yet, officials said, but the US is still looking. It fits the pattern of broader Iranian efforts to widen the front against the US and the west by directly or indirectly providing arms to proxy groups. \u201cThat\u2019s something we definitely have our eyes on,\u201d the senior administration official said. But the Houthis are also one of the most independent-minded of the different Iran-aligned groups and are the one over which Tehran exercises arguably the least amount of control. Iran broadly has sought to tightly manage any potential escalation arising from the war in Gaza, calibrating its response to extract costs from the US and Israel without allowing it to spiral into direct conflict. And so some US officials are skeptical Iran is involved. \u201cDon\u2019t think Iran is actually part of this,\u201d said one military official. \u201cHouthis be a\u2019 Houthi-ing on their own.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/us-intelligence-houthis-al-shabaab/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
