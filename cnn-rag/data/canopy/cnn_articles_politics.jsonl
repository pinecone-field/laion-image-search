{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_louisiana-abortion-drugs-controlled-dangerous-substances", "text": "Louisiana lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to a bill that would classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifepristone as\u00a0Schedule IV\u00a0controlled dangerous substances\u00a0in the state, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants. The state Senate voted 29-7 to pass the bill largely along party lines, which the state House approved earlier this week. It now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. CNN has reached out to Landry\u2019s office for comment. If signed into law, Louisiana would become the first state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. Senate Bill 276 would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. An amendment to classify the drugs as\u00a0Schedule IV substances\u00a0was added to the legislation after it initially passed out of the Senate, which then concurred the change on Thursday. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given the drug misoprostol against her will. Under the measure, anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription could face a felony charge \u2013 punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000. In a\u00a0medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. Misoprostol is then taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Both drugs can be used in miscarriage care. Misoprostol, which has been available at pharmacies for decades, is also approved\u00a0for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers. Pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption would be exempt from such penalties under the legislation. Louisiana doctors would also still be able to prescribe the drugs. A conviction in Louisiana for distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs\u00a0carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000. The bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification. They argued that \u201cneither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\u201d In response, Pressly said the legislation would not prevent the prescribing or dispensing of the drugs \u201cfor legitimate reasons.\u201d The bill\u2019s proponents, like Pressly, have largely touted the legislation as a way to protect expectant mothers. Sarah Zagorski, the communications director for Louisiana Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, praised the GOP lawmakers that supported the bill in a statement Thursday. Zagorski also said the intention of the bill \u201cis to stop the abortion industry from profiting off of abuse and trafficking of vulnerable women through their flagrantly illegal distribution of pills.\u201d Critics have argued \u200b\u200bthat instead of helping women, the bill could prevent them from accessing necessary care. Michelle Erenberg, executive director of reproductive rights group Lift Louisiana, said the bill was a \u201clegitimate attempt to address a terrible crime\u201d that had been \u201chijacked by anti-abortion activists.\u201d \u201cIt is absurd that the state would continue to pass laws that will delay access to timely care for pregnant patients when we have one of the highest maternal death rates in the country,\u201d Erenberg added. Victoria, a New Orleans woman who flew across the country to get a medication abortion in 2023 because of Louisiana\u2019s ban on the procedure, said she felt \u201ctrapped\u201d and \u201cdehumanized\u201d when she heard the bill passed through the state Senate. She asked CNN to withhold her last name out of fear of backlash against her and her family. \u201cI feel trapped and dehumanized,\u201d she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s more infuriating is the completely disingenuous posture that the goal with these restrictions is to protect women. Clearly, that\u2019s a ruse and it\u2019s an attack on women\u2019s attempts to hold onto their right to self-determination.\u201d Medication abortion, which makes up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States, has emerged as a national political flashpoint since the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Supreme Court is currently considering a major case that challenges the FDA\u2019s approval of mifepristone, with a majority of justices appearing skeptical in March of a nationwide ban or new limits on the drug. A decision is expected by July. President Joe Biden said in a statement Thursday that the Louisiana bill is a \u201cdirect result\u201d of former President Donald Trump \u201coverturning Roe v. Wade.\u201d Trump appointed three of the conservative justices who voted to reverse the decades-old ruling. Biden added that \u201cthis is a scary time for women across America\u201d and said, if reelected, Trump will \u201ctry to make what is happening in states like Louisiana a reality nationwide.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_trump-documents-case-judge-cannon-hearing", "text": "During a marathon day of proceedings in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, a morning hearing in front of Judge Aileen Cannon devolved into a shouting match amongst the attorneys, and the afternoon series of arguments prompted the judge to wonder if the legal nuances of the case may be too difficult for jurors to understand. The heated arguments played out in a morning proceeding in Fort Pierce, Florida, that had been scheduled for Walt Nauta, one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s co-defendants, to present arguments that special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team had selectively and vindictively brought charges against him. But the hearing quickly diverted into a longstanding disagreement over an August 2022 meeting between prosecutor Jay Bratt and Nauta\u2019s defense attorney, Stanley Woodward. Woodward has claimed in court proceedings and filings that Bratt attempted to pressure him into convincing Nauta to cooperate against Trump by threatening to affect a potential judgeship nomination. Cannon did not issue a ruling from the bench on Nauta\u2019s motion that the case be dismissed on those grounds. Nor did Cannon rule on a motion she heard during an afternoon session Wednesday, brought by all three of the case\u2019s defendants, who claimed that the indictment suffers technical flaws that required the dismissal of the charges. Cannon seemed skeptical of those arguments, while also expressing concern about a jury\u2019s ability to understand legal nuances in the case at a future trial. \u201cReal people have to decide these issues,\u201d Cannon said. Prosecutor says defense attorney was making \u2018garbage argument\u2019 Nauta claims that he was criminally charged in the case as retaliation for declining to cooperate with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the former president\u2019s retention of classified documents at his estate. \u201cI had been recommended for a judgeship, that\u2019s beyond dispute,\u201d Woodward said Wednesday. \u201cThere was a folder about defense counsel on the table\u201d during that meeting, he said, claiming Bratt referenced that judgeship recommendation. \u201cI think the implication was that I was to travel and convince Mr. Nauta to cooperate with the investigation, and if I didn\u2019t that, there would be consequences,\u201d Woodward said. Prosecutor David Harbach then rose and accused Woodward of engaging in \u201cprocedural gamesmanship\u201d by making a \u201cgarbage argument\u201d about the meeting. \u201cMr. Woodward\u2019s story of what happened at that meeting is a fantasy,\u201d Harbach shouted, banging his hand on the lectern in front of him. \u201cIt did not happen.\u201d The heated proceedings Wednesday come as the Manhattan\u00a0hush money case\u00a0against Trump nears its conclusion and a new phase of pretrial activity gets underway in the\u00a0federal classified documents prosecution in Florida. The hearing was the first before Cannon since she indefinitely delayed the start of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin as early as this week. It has been more than a month since the judge last held a public, in-person hearing in the case \u2013 though she has held at least one sealed proceeding since then. Trump is charged with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and of resisting the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. Trump, Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira have all pleaded\u00a0not guilty. During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Harbach slammed Woodward, saying he chose not to report the alleged incident until months later and has repeatedly changed his recollection of the conversation. \u201cThis is a lawyer whose allegations amount basically to him being extorted,\u201d Harbach said of Woodward, waving his arms. Woodward sat behind the prosecutor with his hands clasped and his head down. The judge quickly scolded Harbach, telling the attorney to \u201ccalm down.\u201d Cannon questioned why there was no evidence gathered of what happened in the 2022 conversation, saying, \u201cWhy do those comments [about Woodward] have to be made?\u201d \u201cThat is not true, and I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Harbach shouted back. The prosecutor said that that there was no recording of the conversation between Bratt and Woodward, but that Smith\u2019s team has preserved any record they have of the meeting. Woodward shot back up to the lectern, saying that \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and offering to testify under oath to what he remembered of the meeting. Nauta\u2019s request to dismiss the case was the first of two issues before Cannon on Wednesday. An afternoon hearing will center on co-defendants\u2019\u00a0argument the indictment suffers technical flaws requiring its dismissal. Trump had obtained permission from the judge\u00a0to skip Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. Cannon says that jury may struggle to understand charges When postponing the trial,\u00a0Cannon pointed to the mountain of unresolved pretrial issues for not putting a new date on the calendar. Wednesday kicks off a stretch of hearings scheduled through late July that will get the case through some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the pretrial issues. During the afternoon portion of Wednesday\u2019s arguments, the defense lawyers raised concerns about how prosecutors structured the indictment, claiming that the wording for different charges within the same indictment sometimes sounded the same. Prosecutor Jay Bratt said the charges reference different parts of the obstruction statute used to charge Trump and two of his employees. Bratt also pointed out that jurors would be given clear instructions about the charges during a trial. Cannon said that while \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard for someone to detect what\u2019s different in these counts,\u201d\u00a0she noted \u201cthat will be a project\u201d down the road. Cannon has not yet set a trial date in the case after indefinitely postponing it in an order earlier this month. The Florida judge spent hours Wednesday entertaining theories from defense attorneys about what they say were problems in the investigation and prosecution of the former president, Nauta and the third co-defendant, Carlos De Oliveira. The defense theories\u00a0ranged from allegations that prosecutors tried to extort Nauta\u2019s attorney to claims prosecutors used inappropriate and\u00a0\u201cattention-grabbing\u201d descriptions of Mar-a-Lago in the indictment. Cannon ultimately suggested that the \u201cpotpourri of criticisms\u201d from the three defense teams may be best suited for a jury to decide at an eventual trial. Several legal issues have still gone unresolved, including at least five motions to dismiss the criminal case. Cannon has repeatedly suggested that\u00a0various legal issues could be punted down the road and handled closer to trial. Cannon\u2019s slow pace in the case\u00a0has attracted criticisms from outside legal experts, who have accused the Trump-appointed\u00a0judge of playing into delay tactics by the GOP\u2019s presumptive\u00a0White House nominee. Unless Cannon picks up her momentum considerably, it appears unlikely the charges will go before a jury before the 2024 election. If Trump wins the White House, it is expected he will make the charges against him go\u00a0away. Newly unsealed filings give more details about the investigation Until recent days, several major motions from Trump attacking the prosecution were not even publicly docketed. The proceedings have become mired in disputes over what should be redacted in public filings. On Tuesday, hundreds of pages of previously sealed court filings were posted publicly as part of efforts by the former president to have the charges against him thrown out. Those filings included a previously sealed March 2023 ruling by a federal judge in Washington, DC, finding there was \u201csufficient\u201d evidence that Trump committed crimes, allowing investigators to obtain information from his former lawyer that would normally be protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump is seeking to throw out that evidence, as well as the evidence obtained in the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, from which investigators obtained many of the documents underlying several of the charges against Trump. Those motions are not scheduled for argument on Wednesday, and Cannon has not yet set a hearing on them. In her order Sunday allowing for the filings to be made public, Cannon took a shot at prosecutors \u2013 one of several swipes she\u2019s made at Smith\u2019s office. She expressed \u201cconcern\u201d the special counsel\u2019s office had sought redactions of information in the newly unsealed filings after previously giving its OK for that information to be published in full in earlier court filings. \u201cThe Court is disappointed in these developments. The sealing and redaction rules should be applied consistently and fairly upon a sufficient factual and legal showing,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cAnd parties should not make requests that undermine any prior representations or positions except upon full disclosure to the Court and appropriate briefing.\u201d This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/trump-documents-case-judge-cannon-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_biden-kenya-president-state-visit-china", "text": "When Kenyan President William Ruto touched down in Beijing seven months ago, he was welcomed on the tarmac with a red carpet and cordons of Chinese troops standing at attention. Among the goals of his three-day state visit in October: securing another $1 billion in loans from China to help complete infrastructure projects. On Wednesday, when he arrived at Joint Base Andrews to begin another state visit \u2013 this time to Washington \u2013 he again found a red carpet and troops. This time, however, a special emissary was sent to greet his plane: first lady Dr. Jill Biden. President Joe Biden is leaning on the highest trappings of American diplomacy this week to boost ties with the East African nation, including designating Kenya a major non-NATO ally \u2013 the first in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 and hosting a sunset state dinner on the White House South Lawn. Biden offered effusive praise for his Kenyan counterpart, including for Kenya\u2019s leadership on \u201ca historic African green industrialization initiative\u201d as he welcomed Ruto to the White House for the visit. \u201cTogether, the United States and Kenya are working to deliver on the challenges that matter most to our people\u2019s\u2019 lives \u2013 health security, economic security, cybersecurity, and climate security,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. President, your bold leadership on this front has been important and particularly impactful.\u201d Looming over the pomp and circumstance is China\u2019s expanding role in Africa, which has become a central testing ground for the world\u2019s two largest economies as they jockey for economic and geopolitical influence. Senior administration officials acknowledge a central factor in scheduling a state visit with Kenya was the desire to counter China\u2019s influence and financial leverage on the African continent, which has outpaced the United States in direct investment. \u201cFor many, many years, it was really the Chinese who showed up in Africa and in Kenya,\u201d US Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman told CNN in an interview. With the first state visit for an African leader in nearly two decades, \u201cthere\u2019s a specific message to Kenya and to the continent, which is: America wants to be your partner.\u201d For decades, China has been making high-interest loans to low-income African nations to help them fund development for domestic projects, including some flagship infrastructure projects within China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Among those:\u00a0A high-speed rail route from Nairobi to Mombasa\u00a0that the Kenyan government funded with billions in loans from Chinese state banks. A decade after the construction of that railway, Kenya and the US plan to announce that an American company will be building a roadway along that same corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s a great opportunity for America to start bidding on these big government contracts that make a difference to the infrastructure\u201d in Kenya, Whitman told CNN. From 2000 to 2022, Beijing lent $170 billion to African nations \u2013 including $6.7 billion to Kenya \u2013 to fund these initiatives, according to Boston University\u2019s\u00a0Chinese Loans to Africa database. Those loans saddled Africa with costly debt that countries have been increasingly unable to service, leading many nations to seek relief from their sovereign lenders.\u00a0Kenya\u2019s debt is projected to reach a level of 74% of its economic output, with the country paying an increasing share of government revenue on rising interest costs. \u201cToo many nations are forced to make a choice between development and debt, between investing in their people and paying back their creditors,\u201d Biden said during a joint press conference with Ruto. Kenya has been forced to choose between servicing its debt and advancing its development, one reason Kenya\u2019s Ruto has continued to seek new funds from Beijing. \u201cThese countries, I think, have to stay friends with as many people as they can,\u201d Whitman told CNN of Ruto\u2019s continued financial relationship with Beijing. \u201cThe needs are great \u2026 we have to come with a better offer.\u201d During the state visit, the US and Kenya are set to announce the \u201cNairobi-Washington Vision,\u201d calling on creditor countries \u2013 and likely China in particular \u2013 to provide grants, budget support and debt suspension to help alleviate the burden. Ruto, meanwhile, has called on African leaders to lean more heavily on Western nations and lower-interest loans from the World Bank to fund their development. \u201cThere\u2019s some real China fatigue in Africa,\u201d said a former senior administration official. \u201cThe administration sees an opening there.\u201d And the US has already begun stepping into that opening. At the Group of 20 summit last year, the US and European Union announced they would back the buildout of a rail corridor connecting Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia that would facilitate the transit of the region\u2019s critical minerals back to the West. In his meetings with Biden, Ruto has sought to emphasize Kenya \u2013 and the broader African continent \u2013 as an area worthy of investment. In a gathering of CEOs on Wednesday at the White House, he told his American counterpart that old perceptions of the continent were changing. \u201cYou\u2019re all past thinking about Africa as a place of war and destruction instead of opportunity, and we\u2019re making that real,\u201d Ruto told the president during the meeting, according to a senior US administration official who paraphrased the leader\u2019s remark. Still, Ruto\u2019s visit to Washington comes at a moment of political instability in many African countries. Military coups over the last year have toppled governments and underscored a fragile rule of law, while traditional American allies on the continent have demonstrated new willingness to break from the United States. One of the goals of Thursday\u2019s state visit is to demonstrate the ability of democracies \u2013 like Kenya\u2019s \u2013 to deliver for their people. Biden, who hosted African leaders at the White House for a summit earlier in his term, has been consumed since then by conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Since the December 2022 gathering, during which he declared he was \u201call in\u201d on Africa, he\u2019s hosted only one African leader for talks at the White House: Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Manuel Gon\u00e7alves Louren\u00e7o. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the world has had a lot going on the last year and a half,\u201d a senior administration official said this week, pointing to a stream of Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials who have visited Africa as a sign of the Biden team\u2019s commitment. Yet the spate of foreign conflicts has prevented Biden himself from paying a visit, which he vowed to do within a year of the summit. He still intends to travel to Africa as president, his national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday, though he couldn\u2019t say when. Biden said as he welcomed Ruto to the White House on Wednesday he planned to visit Africa next year \u2013 after, he hopes, securing reelection. \u201cI plan on going in February,\u201d Biden told reporters. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Biden was joking; he asked afterward how questions about his travel plans were \u201crelevant.\u201d Relevant or not, a presidential trip to Africa would come only after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the continent last year for talks with leaders of the BRICS emerging economies. Advisers say Biden remains intent on focusing attention on Africa, particularly amid jockeying for strategic influence from Russia and China. A comparison with former President Donald Trump \u2013 who privately referred to some African countries as \u201cshitholes\u201d and never himself visited Africa when in office \u2013 is also not lost on Biden\u2019s aides. Thursday\u2019s state visit to Washington will be the first for an African leader since 2008. \u201cWe believe that what today will showcase is not questions about the US commitment but answers that the US is actually delivering for Africa, for the African people \u2013 in this case, for the country of Kenya, but also with Kenya for the broader continent,\u201d Sullivan said Wednesday. In choosing Kenya for Thursday\u2019s state visit, Biden and his team are signaling they view Ruto and his country as among the most critical US allies in a region where allegiances toward Washington have shifted. Kenya has been a key partner for the US in combatting al-Shabab militants in neighboring Somalia and earlier this year joined a US-led international coalition meant to beat back attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes by Houthi rebels in Yemen. \u201cAround the world, Kenya and America are also standing united against the terror of ISIS and Al-Shabaab, that they continue to perpetrate in East Africa, the aggression that Russia is inflicting on Ukraine, the violence that has toppled too many democracies across both our regions,\u201d Biden said Thursday as he welcomed Ruto to the White House. Kenya is also preparing to deploy 1,000 paramilitary police officers to Haiti in a bid to quell gang violence, a mission largely funded by the United States\u00a0that is expected to last at least one year, according to Whitman. Biden on Thursday defended his administration\u2019s decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters that doing so could raise \u201call kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we\u2019re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States.\u201d Biden said the US was instead focused on finding \u201ca partner or partners who would lead that effort that we would participate in, not with American forces, but with supplies and making sure they have what they needed.\u201d This week, a delegation of Kenyan\u00a0\u201ccommand staff\u201d arrived\u00a0in\u00a0Haiti, according to a law enforcement source in the country, ahead of the Kenyan-led\u00a0multinational security support force. The delegation was expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready \u2013 an assessment that will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN. Despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, however, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council. \u201cThis is not something that is a completely straight line. It is a dynamic operating environment, to say the least, in Haiti, and this is going to require an adaptive, flexible approach but one guided by certain core functions and operations,\u201d Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. This story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/biden-kenya-president-state-visit-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_politics_georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election", "text": "Rebel Teahouse is Christine Nguyen\u2019s business. And her happy place. Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_donald-trump-fundraising-email-what-matters", "text": "Followers of former President Donald Trump were meant to be startled when they were sent an email Tuesday, addressed from \u201cPresident Trump,\u201d with this arresting subject line: \u201cThey were authorized to shoot me!\u201d The preview line in the email did not back down. \u201cI nearly escaped death. Biden\u2019s DOJ was locked and loaded for deadly force at Mar-a-Lago \u2026\u201d Literal readers of Trump\u2019s message might wonder: Is this a cry for help from physical harm? But everyone should know it is just Trump asking, again, for money. Writing fundraising emails for politicians these days frequently seems like an exercise in clickbait, but alleging a life in danger is something new. It also feels like a twist on the outrageous \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d argument Trump\u2019s lawyer made before the US Supreme Court last month that presidents should, at least in theory, be able to call out a hit on a political rival and not face prosecution. What is Trump talking about? The actual facts of the \u201cauthorized to shoot me\u201d allegation, as reported by CNN, are these: A recently unsealed document outlining the FBI\u2019s procedure for searching Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022 for classified documents included standard language about the \u201cuse of force\u201d in searches. From CNN\u2019s report by Tierney Sneed,\u00a0Katelyn Polantz,\u00a0Holmes Lybrand\u00a0and\u00a0Hannah Rabinowitz: The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. What actually happened? The FBI coordinated the search with the Secret Service and took pains to be as low profile as possible, according to testimony on Capitol Hill last year by Stephen D\u2019Antuono, former FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington field office. \u201cWe made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues,\u201d D\u2019Antuono said. \u201cWe\u2019re not banging down any doors. We weren\u2019t bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.\u201d Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago when the search occurred, and he actually announced the search was occurring with a post to social media. Read CNN\u2019s original report on the search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. Those details don\u2019t fit into the subject line of an email, and they certainly don\u2019t fit Trump\u2019s narrative that he is being persecuted. The more important headline from the unsealed documents, according to CNN\u2019s report from Tuesday, was that a federal judge in Washington, DC, found \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of crimes before Trump was charged with mishandling classified data. The judge, Beryl Howell, cited the discovery of additional documents with classified markings found in Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago bedroom months after the FBI search. Trump is a master sensationalist, so place the email subject line where he says he\u2019s in physical harm within his oeuvre of over-the-top and untrue allegations. How to get people to open fundraising emails The email address where I get fundraising pitches from politicians received seven such messages from Trump on Tuesday. On any given day, there will likely be at least one that is misleading. Like this one from Tuesday: \u201cI\u2019ve made a final decision. What do you think of my VP choice?\u201d (In truth, Trump has not announced who his running mate will be). Other subject lines are pushing merch: \u201cYOU, have you seen my mugshot? I put it on a mug for you.\u201d (In related news, Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is now selling his own brand of coffee.) There are sweepstakes to win trips to Las Vegas and London. (You can enter to win with a $20.24 contribution). Trump\u2019s allegations about the FBI document were not just contained in the fundraising email. In a post to social media, he weaved the \u201cdeadly force\u201d allegation in with other, ongoing complaints: The temperature in his Manhattan criminal trial courtroom was too cold. Trump thinks President Joe Biden is unfit for office, and he thinks Biden\u2019s Cabinet should remove him from the presidency. The social media post looked like this: \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d The truth is that voters will get to weigh in on Biden\u2019s fitness for office. The New York criminal trial judge, Juan Merchan, explained to Trump at trial that raising the thermostat would turn the ice box into an oven. And there\u2019s absolutely no indication whatsoever that anyone in Biden\u2019s Cabinet is now considering or ever has considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. On that last point, the same cannot be said for Trump \u2013 some of whose Cabinet members did discuss but did not act on using the 25th Amendment after the riot at the Capitol in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/donald-trump-fundraising-email-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_supreme-court-south-carolina-district-black-voting-power", "text": "The Supreme Court upheld a pro-Republican South Carolina congressional map Thursday, rejecting the argument raised by civil rights groups that lawmakers impermissibly used race as a proxy to bolster the GOP\u2019s chances. But the high court also said that the civil rights groups that challenged the maps could continue to pursue one part of their claim, a move that will likely delay the battle over the districts for months. With state election deadlines approaching, a federal court in March had already ruled that South Carolina could use the contested map in this year\u2019s election. The decision was 6-3 along conservative-liberal lines. \u201cThe circumstantial evidence falls far short of showing that race, not partisan preferences, drove the districting process, and none of the expert reports offered by the Challengers provides any significant support for their position,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. The Supreme Court has previously said that it will not review partisan gerrymanders \u2013 that is, maps intended to give one party an advantage over the other. In creating those advantages, however, mapmakers are barred from relying predominately on race as they move voters from one district to another. The challenge is that race and party affiliation sometimes align, and so it can be difficult to disentangle one from the other. \u201cThe dispute between the Democratic and Republican appointees in this case is a technical one, but one with massive legal consequences,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cHere, the conservative justices effectively substituted their judgment about what actually happened for that of the district court \u2013 which could have consequences far beyond the specific context of racial gerrymandering cases.\u201d Scathing Kagan dissent for liberals Liberal Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a lengthy dissent joined by the other two liberals arguing that the majority will give state lawmakers and mapmakers \u201can incentive to use race as a proxy to achieve partisan ends.\u201d \u201cGo right ahead, this Court says to States today. Go ahead, though you have no recognized justification for using race, such as to comply with statutes ensuring equal voting rights,\u201d Kagan wrote. \u201cGo ahead, though you are (at best) using race as a short-cut to bring about partisan gains \u2013 to elect more Republicans in one case, more Democrats in another.\u201d She continued: \u201cIn the electoral sphere especially, where \u2018ugly patterns of pervasive racial discrimination\u2019 have so long governed, we should demand better \u2013 of ourselves, of our political representatives, and most of all of this Court.\u201d Thomas says courts should stop reviewing gerrymandering claims Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence questioning whether federal courts should be policing racial gerrymanders in the first place. That would be a dramatic departure from the way federal courts have reviewed redistricting claims for decades, making it far harder for minority voters to challenge racial gerrymanders. \u201cIn my view, the Court has no power to decide these types of claims,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cDrawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges. There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches,\u201d he wrote. Thomas pointed to a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that ended federal judicial review of partisan gerrymanders and suggested that the same logic of that opinion applied to racial gerrymandering cases. Both types of disputes, Thomas wrote, require courts \u201cto address an issue \u2013 congressional districting \u2013 that is textually committed to a coordinate political department, Congress.\u201d \u201cA system in which only specialized experts can discern the existence of a constitutional injury is intolerable, and strongly suggests that the racial gerrymandering injury is not amenable to judicial resolution,\u201d he said. Razor-thin GOP majority at risk The litigation over South Carolina\u2019s maps was one of several high-profile redistricting cases to make its way up to the Supreme Court following the 2020 census and the once-a-decade redrawing of congressional districts to account for changes in population. Last year, a 5-4 majority ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map after groups argued it violated the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. A separate but related redistricting case from Louisiana is still working its way through federal courts. Republicans currently hold a razor-thin majority in the US House of Representatives and the outcome of similar legal skirmishes could help determine which party controls the House when the new Congress convenes next year. In Alabama, the new maps could yield a Democratic pickup. New maps in Georgia and North Carolina, by contrast, either preserve or bolster chances for the GOP. In South Carolina,\u00a0the district at issue was drawn in 2020 to benefit the GOP. The\u00a0NAACP\u00a0South Carolina State Conference\u00a0and a Black voter named Taiwan Scott said the use of race dominated the decision-making process and that the state worked to intentionally dilute the power of Black voters. A federal court agreed, referring to the revised map as a \u201cbleaching.\u201d Although the coastal district consistently elected Republicans from 1980 to 2016, a Democrat was elected in 2018 in a political upset. Two years later, Republican Rep. Nancy  Mace captured the seat in a tight race. When state lawmakers began considering new congressional maps in 2021, the Republican majorities sought to create a stronger GOP tilt in the district. Republicans currently hold six of the state\u2019s seven districts. After an eight-day trial featuring 42 witnesses and 652 exhibits, a three-judge district court panel last year held that the South Carolina map amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander in violation of the equal protection clause because race was the predominant factor in the redistricting. South Carolina Republicans, led by state Senate President Thomas Alexander, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court early last year, arguing in part that the maps had been drawn with politics \u2013 not race \u2013 in mind. An issue that repeatedly came up in the case was why the plaintiffs who challenged the map didn\u2019t provide an alternative map to show that the new districts could have achieved the same partisan goals without having such a significant impact on race. \u201cWe have repeatedly observed that an alternative map of this sort can go a long way toward helping plaintiffs disentangle race and politics,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cAn alternative map can perform the critical task of distinguishing between racial and political motivations when race and partisanship are closely entwined.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_abortion-rights-advocates-waiting-periods", "text": "Longstanding abortion restrictions like waiting periods and provider regulations are now under legal attack in states where Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal prompted voters to amend their state constitutions to protect abortion rights. Abortion rights advocates in Ohio and Michigan have pivoted off of successful ballot initiatives in those states to challenge abortion restrictions that had been in effect before the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to obtain an abortion in 2022. In Ohio, the ACLU has used the recent amendment to that state\u2019s constitution to boost lawsuits attacking abortion restrictions. One of those cases is challenging laws that made it harder to access abortion pills. Another is targeting Ohio\u2019s 24-waiting period and related abortion regulations. In Michigan, a lawsuit brought by another reproductive rights group is seeking to strike down that state\u2019s 24-hour waiting. Abortion rights advocates say the robust language that is in amendments in Michigan and Ohio reflects voters\u2019 pushback not just to the 2022 Supreme Court ruling \u2013 known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization \u2013 but to how the original 1973 Roe precedent was chipped away at by conservative litigants and courts over time. \u201cWhen voters vote for those broad amendments, they\u2019re saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want to go back to the way things were before Dobbs. We want to ensure that reproductive rights are protected to the maximum extent under the law,\u2019\u201d said Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing abortion provider organizations challenging the Michigan regulations. Similar ballot initiatives have passed in reliably blue states like California. But the success abortion rights advocates have had in passing such measures in purple states and even Ohio \u2013 where Republicans have dominated recent elections \u2013 is notable. \u201cThe people are coming out in full force to support reproductive rights and reproductive autonomy and the ability of every individual to decide if when and how to continue a pregnancy and give birth for themselves,\u201d said Meagan Burrows, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, who is involved in the Ohio litigation. The dynamic could soon be coming to the other states that are considering proposals to add abortion rights protections to their constitutions. Anti-abortion activists say that abortion rights advocates are stretching the constitutional amendments beyond their meaning, suggesting that voters in other states should be wary. \u201cRunning deceptive campaigns is the playbook for Florida, Arizona, Missouri and every other state with abortion on the ballot, but the litigation proves these amendments go farther than they will ever admit in a 30-second commercial,\u201d Katie Daniel, the state policy director for the organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement to CNN. Abortion rights advocates say that the legal landscape differs state by state, so it\u2019s difficult to predict the litigation that could come out of the proposed amendments if adopted. Disputes about the reach of constitutional amendments In at least one state, anti-abortion activists are actively seeking to overturn a successful state ballot measure. A lawsuit filed in federal court by Right to Life of Michigan and other anti-abortion groups and individuals is seeking to block that state\u2019s new constitutional amendment. The lawsuit puts forward several claims, including fetal personhood arguments. Briefing in that longshot case is under way. In the Michigan case brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights, state Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, has declined to defend the 24-hour waiting period and the other abortion laws targeted in the lawsuit, although the Democratic-controlled legislature did not repeal them when it voted last year to reverse several other abortion limits that were said to run afoul of the new constitutional amendment. In addition to the waiting period, the new lawsuit is challenging limits on the kinds of healthcare providers who can perform abortions as well as a mandate that providers give abortion seekers a script of counseling that the lawsuit says is \u201cbiased,\u201d \u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cirrelevant,\u201d and \u201cnon-medical.\u201d The state\u2019s deputy solicitor general Eric Restuccia, a Republican, has been tasked to defend the restrictions and is opposing the abortion rights advocates\u2019 request for the restrictions to be put on pause while the case plays out. In court filings, he wrote that the laws in question \u201chave been in place for more than 30 years\u201d and that there was \u201cwas nothing in the new constitutional amendment signaling the intent of the people to enact a dramatic departure from the laws in place before the decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org.\u201d He defended the counseling script as \u201cneutral and necessary for ensuring that any consent by a patient is a knowing and informed one.\u201d Genevieve Marnon, legislative director of Right to Life of Michigan, told CNN that the challengers were seeking to use the courts to obtain what they could not achieve legislatively. \u201cThey were unable to use the democratic legislative process to repeal this law,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was up for repeal, and there were members on both sides of the aisle who didn\u2019t agree that this law should be repealed.\u201d The lawsuit filed in Ohio by the ACLU in March goes after similar counseling requirements, in addition to the 24 hours abortion seekers must wait after receiving the counsel before they can undergo the procedure. In court filings opposing ACLU\u2019s lawsuit, Ohio\u2019s Republican attorney general argued that the ballot initiative only re-established the federal legal framework that was in place before the Dobbs\u2019 decision. That legal standard \u2013 laid out in a 1992 Supreme Court case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey \u2013 allowed states to impose restrictions on abortion as long as the rules don\u2019t place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on access to abortions before a fetus is viable. The Ohio amendment, however, puts the bar for states much higher. It allows for measures that interfere with abortion access only if they are the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d to ensure the patient\u2019s health. Any restrictions on the procedure also must be in line with \u201cwidely accepted and evidence-based standards of care,\u201d according to the Ohio amendment. To support his argument, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost is pointing not to the language of the amendment itself but the news stories and messaging around it. \u201cVoters were primarily told, by the dominant and successful voices, that the Amendment would restore the status quo,\u201d Yost said in a court filing. The ACLU counters that, a month before the vote in the amendment, even the state attorney general was describing the proposal as going beyond Roe and Casey.\u00a0 Yost now claims the guidance did not contemplate an \u201cOctober wave of reassuring the public that no such broader effects arose from the Amendment, and that it was merely \u2018restoring Roe\u2019 after all.\u201d Using \u2018every tool available\u2019 In Arizona, abortion right advocates are pushing a constitutional amendment that would enshrine the right to an abortion in language that is akin to the initiatives adopted in Ohio and Michigan. The state\u2019s legislature recently repealed a near-total ban on abortion, but a 15-week ban remains on the books, as do counseling and waiting period requires that were in effect before the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Dobbs. There are campaigns for initiatives to expand abortion rights in several other states, but only in a few states so far have abortion rights advocates cleared the required hurdles to guarantee the proposals will be on the ballot. The ACLU declined to answer specific questions about the potential for more litigation if the ballot campaigns in those other states are successful. In a statement to CNN, ACLU senior policy counsel Jessica Arons said that the measures the ACLU are involved in are being crafted \u201cto address the unique access challenges communities face in each state.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re determined to use every tool available to ensure we all can make our own personal medical decisions during pregnancy without political interference,\u201d Arons said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/abortion-rights-advocates-waiting-periods/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The choice of the singer and choir is a nod to their guests\u2019 love of country and gospel music, the first lady\u2019s office said. \u201cDistinguished songwriter and recording artist Brad Paisley and the highly acclaimed Howard Gospel Choir were selected by the First Lady to perform musical selections at the State Dinner,\u201d the office of the first lady said in a statement shared first with CNN. The statement continued, \u201cBrad Paisley and the Howard Gospel Choir were chosen by Dr. Biden to honor President and First Lady Ruto\u2019s love of Country and Gospel music, and in celebration of the continuing friendship between the United States and Kenya.\u201d A state visit\u00a0is among the highest diplomatic tools a White House can employ to honor a top ally, with the\u00a0meticulously planned event aimed at intertwining and highlighting American and Kenyan cultures as Biden seeks to\u00a0emphasize the strong alliance\u00a0between the two countries. Biden and Ruto welcomed Kenyan and American business leaders to the White House on Wednesday as part of the African leader\u2019s official state visit. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way to kick off this visit,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToday as we honor 60 years of ties between our countries, it\u2019s clear that our people are the true strength of this partnership. And a partnership that is working well. And nowhere is it more important than in the realm of innovation.\u201d He also thanked the leaders attending, telling them to \u201ckeep it up.\u201d This visit marks the first time an American president has hosted an African leader for a state visit since February 2008, when President George W. Bush hosted the president of Ghana. Biden, who said he would visit the African continent \u201csoon\u201d in 2022, has yet to make good on that promise. But he has hailed cooperation with Africa and is seeking to build relationships with key leaders as a counter to Russia and China\u2019s inroads on the continent. Jill Biden traveled to Namibia and Kenya in February 2023. The Grammy-winning Paisley previously performed for a black-tie dinner for bipartisan governors at the White House last year. And he joined Jill Biden for a visit to a pop-up Covid-19 vaccination site in Nashville in June 2021. Paisley first performed at the White House in 2009 during the Obama administration as part of a music series. He recalled the emotion of singing the song \u201cWelcome to the Future\u201d in front of then-President Barack Obama. \u201cThe last verse is about a kid in high school who\u2019s having a difficult time, and who\u2019s Black, and he has a cross burned in his yard for asking out the homecoming queen. And the line of the chorus is, \u2018Wake up Martin Luther, welcome to the future,\u2019\u201d he wrote in a CNN blog post at the time. He continued, \u201cBeing able to deliver that message personally to one of the people who ushered in this new era is really one of the most completely, artistically satisfying moments I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d The first lady told reporters that Thursday\u2019s state dinner will be held outdoors on the White House grounds. \u201cTomorrow night we mark the 60th anniversary of the United States partnership with Kenya with an elegant dinner under the stars in a pavilion made almost entirely of glass looking up at our one sky,\u201d Jill Biden said, even though rain is in the forecast for the Washington area. \u201cWhile outside night surrounds us, inside guests will be brought together over the glow of candles in a space saturated with warm pinks and reds.\u201d The dinner will be held in a \u201ctransparent pavilion\u201d on the South Lawn, according to the first lady\u2019s office, that will be adorned with more than 1,000 candles. \u201cTomorrow night we\u2019ve created an experience that will feature the beautiful scenes of the White House and the Washington Monument that few get to enjoy,\u201d White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo said. There will be three courses during Thursday\u2019s dinner \u2013 the first will be a chilled heirloom tomato soup. The main course for Thursday\u2019s dinner will be a \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d duo of butter-poached lobster and smoked beef short ribs, according to White House executive chef Cris Comerford. Some of the kale that the chef is using in Thursday\u2019s dinner comes from the White House garden. The tables for the dinner will be set with sequined lavender and floral-patterned linens, but White House china will not be used for the dinner since it is being held outdoors. Instead the White House rented dishes to use, according to the social secretary. Event planner Bryan Rafanelli also helped the White House plan for the state dinner.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban", "text": "All of South Dakota\u2019s nine indigenous tribes have voted to ban Gov. Kristi Noem from\u00a0their\u00a0lands. On Tuesday, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe executive council ruled in favor\u00a0of barring\u00a0the Republican governor\u00a0from its reservation. In response to a request for comment on Wednesday, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe sent a readout of its president\u2019s interactions with Noem ahead of the vote. Flandreau President Tony Reider called an emergency meeting last weekend in response to Noem\u2019s comments, according to the readout. The meeting was \u201ccontentious at times, as some members vocalized their opposition.\u201d After that Reider set up a meeting with the governor\u2019s office, which took place on Monday. That conversation was \u201crespectful and productive.\u201d \u201cPresident Reider informed the governor that a ban from our territories is imminent and requested that the Governor refrain from making future blanket statements that offend the tribes within the boundaries of the State of South Dakota, some of which depend on state services for the needs of their people. It was recommended that the Governor clarify her statements and issue an apology to all tribal nations for the misunderstanding,\u201d the readout said. \u201cUntil such a time, the Executive Council and the people of the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe stand with our fellow nations.\u201d That vote bookended a ripple effect of tribes with reservations that stretch into South Dakota moving to prevent Noem from setting foot on their land,\u00a0spurred by comments\u00a0she\u00a0made earlier this year. During a town hall, she\u00a0argued\u00a0that tribal leaders were profiting off of drug cartels in the state and prioritizing those cartels over parenting children on their reservations. Noem has since doubled down on saying Mexican drug cartels were rampant on Native American reservations in South Dakota. Those comments sparked a domino\u00a0effect\u00a0of tribes denouncing Noem and voting to bar the governor from their lands. According to\u00a0The Argus Leader of South Dakota, leaders of the Flandreau Santee Sioux had been receiving pressure from local citizens to do something in response to Noem\u2019s comments. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, the governor did not directly address the ban, but said she hoped to work with tribal leaders going forward. \u201cI only want to speak truth to the real challenges that are being faced in some areas of Indian Country. I want to focus on solutions that lead to safer communities for all our families, educational outcomes for all our children, and declining addiction numbers for all our people. We cannot tackle these issues without addressing the problem: dangerous criminals who perpetuate violence and illegal activities in all areas of our state,\u201d Noem said in the statement. \u201cWe need to take action. It is my hope tribal leadership will take the opportunity to work with me to be an example of how cooperation is better for all people rather than political attacks.\u201d Earlier in May, the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe voted to bar Noem from reservation land. The Standing Rock Sioux, Crow Creek Sioux, Rosebud, Cheyenne River Sioux,\u00a0Oglala Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes all had similar votes earlier this year. The votes came as Noem found herself in the national spotlight over anecdotes from her recently released book describing killing her 14-month-old wirehair pointer, named Cricket, and an unnamed goat. The book included anecdotes about Noem meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and cancelling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Noem and\u00a0staff\u00a0\u00a0have since indicated that the Kim anecdote\u00a0did not happen and should not have been in the book. French officials have denied any such meeting between Macron and the South Dakota governor, while she was a member of Congress, ever took place. Before her book rollout, Noem\u2019s name had been mentioned on the shortlist to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential\u00a0pick\u00a0in 2024. But\u00a0her\u00a0standing\u00a0has faded. Noem has not softened her rhetoric about tribes and Mexican cartels. Instead, she\u2019s repeatedly stressed the importance of border security and warned that the Southern border between Texas and Mexico was experiencing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants. Noem has scheduled press conference about border security and how it affects South Dakota. \u201cBanishing me does nothing to solve this problem or to help those who are suffering horrific tragedies,\u201d Noem said in a statement from her office last week.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYesterday, I returned home from the dangerous, deadly warzone at our nation\u2019s Southern Border. South Dakota National Guard soldiers have helped the Texas National Guard construct miles of border wall in 100-degree weather to keep the American people safe \u2013 and keep cartel-driven drugs and human trafficking out of our great country.\u201d Over the last few months, Noem and other top South Dakota officials have announced new programs for tribal law enforcement. In April, Noem and\u00a0state\u00a0Attorney General Marty Jackley rolled out a certification program to help speed up training for local law enforcement.\u00a0And\u00a0earlier this month, Noem named Algin Young, previously the chief of police for the Pine Ridge Reservation, as South Dakota\u2019s Tribal Law Enforcement Liaison.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_undocumented-immigrants-work-permits-jobs", "text": "It can take months for Lisa Winton to find the skilled machinists she needs to build the equipment that fabricates tubes and coax cables for her customers. She knows there\u2019s a bigger pool of experienced workers out there, but she can\u2019t hire them because they are undocumented immigrants. Winton, who co-founded and runs Winton Machine Company in Suwanee, Georgia, depends on immigrant workers \u2013 about a quarter of her 40 employees were not born in the US. Some have been in the country for many years, and all are authorized to work, she said, noting that she turns away applicants who ask to be paid off the books. Unlike larger competitors, her company is too small to help promising candidates apply for work authorization, which puts her at a disadvantage. That\u2019s why Winton is among the hundreds of business leaders pushing the Biden administration to allow more undocumented immigrants who have been living in the US for years to work legally. Many of them already have jobs, are more connected to their communities and have a better command of English \u2013 making them more desirable employees than recent arrivals, she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to give all these people flowing over the border work permits, let\u2019s focus on the people who\u2019ve been here for a long time, paying into the system,\u201d Winton said. \u201cI need more legal people coming to me for jobs.\u201d Spearheaded by the American Business Immigration Coalition and joined by employers, federal lawmakers, local officials and advocates, the drive is asking President Joe Biden to provide work permits to more long-term undocumented residents, as he has done for certain migrant arrivals. The groups have held multiple news conferences and rallies over the past year to bring attention to the issue. Employers have long sought to help fill their labor needs through immigration reform, but Congress remains gridlocked on the issue. The coalition argues Biden can do more through executive action under current law, including by expanding work permits to spouses of US citizens. Similar actions by Biden and former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, however, have spurred lawsuits. The coming presidential election is adding urgency to the coalition\u2019s plea. Trump recently told Time magazine that he plans to deport millions of undocumented people if he wins in November. \u200b\u201cPresident Trump will put America and the American worker first,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. \u201cHe will \u200bseal the border, stop the invasion and expand economic opportunity for American citizens, not illegal aliens.\u201d It\u2019s a campaign promise that worries many employers who depend on immigrant workers. With the election only months away, the Biden administration is discussing providing work permits to undocumented spouses of American citizens and legal residents, as well as to certain other immigrants who have lived in the US for many years, according to sources involved in the conversations. Asked about the discussions, a White House spokesperson said that the administration is \u201cconstantly evaluating possible policy options.\u201d \u201cThe administration remains committed to ensuring those who are eligible for relief can receive it quickly and to building an immigration system that is fairer and more humane,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. Millions of undocumented workers About 7.8 million unauthorized immigrants were in the labor force in 2021, up slightly from 2019, according to the Pew Research Center. They make up just under 5% of the workforce. Many use fake documents or are paid off the books. Some industries employ a sizeable share of undocumented workers, though exact numbers are hard to come by. About 40% of hired farm crop workers are not legally authorized to work, according to the Labor Department\u2019s National Agricultural Workers Survey, though this could be a significant undercount. One in five undocumented workers are employed in a construction-related sector, according to a Center for American Progress report. A significant number of foreign workers in the dairy industry lack proper documentation, according to the National Milk Producers Federation. Other immigrants have received work permits through various US Citizenship and Immigration Services programs, such as Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and Humanitarian Parole. Asylum-seekers can obtain work permits 180 days after they file for asylum. Mayors in several northern US cities, where migrants are arriving, have pushed the Biden administration to expedite the new arrivals\u2019 work authorizations so they can get jobs and not rely on public assistance. More than 2 million people have work authorization through these USCIS programs, though their status is fluid, according to Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. Expanding work authorization to more longtime immigrants will make it easier for businesses to fill job openings, as well as bring stability to those who may already employ undocumented workers, said Rebecca Shi, executive director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, which has 1,400 employers, associations and executives as members. \u201cOur employers started asking, \u2018Hey, what about our existing employees? People that have been working on our farm, milking our cows at 3 a.m. for the last 20 years, or people that are designing semiconductors in these fabrication facilities and have very high skills,\u2019\u201d she said. Nearly 80% of the nearly 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US in 2022 entered before 2010, according to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security. With work permits, the immigrants will be able to get better jobs that pay more \u2013 resulting in a boost to federal, state and local tax revenue, Shi said. While it\u2019s easy to understand why both employers and undocumented workers would want to legalize the arrangement, expanding work authorization could hurt Americans, Vaughan said. Instead, she argued, it would be better to lure back the millions of people who have dropped out of the labor force. \u201cIf we could tap this population, we could meet the needs of a lot of these employers,\u201d she said. \u201cCreating a situation where it\u2019s easier for employers to bypass available US workers is going to create other social problems.\u201d Trump\u2019s promise to deport millions Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that he would conduct \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history\u201d if he is reelected. He made similar promises during his first run for the presidency. During his first term, Trump undertook more than 400 executive actions on immigration, according to the Migration Policy Institute. His administration quadrupled the number of worksite investigations and broadened the types of immigrants subject to enforcement actions, including removal. While arrests and deportations of immigrants living in the US increased, they remained \u201cfar short\u201d of the levels seen under Trump\u2019s predecessors, Tara Watson, an economics professor at Williams College, wrote in an EconoFact post in 2021. \u201cRelative to the late Bush and early Obama eras, the Trump administration removed a modest number of immigrants from the nation\u2019s interior,\u201d she wrote. \u201cInstead, the administration increased the visibility and unpredictability of enforcement activity directed at unauthorized individuals living within the U.S. and expanded the use of detention as part of immigration enforcement.\u201d If Trump wins in November, his administration officials would likely be able to quickly ramp up detentions and deportations since they would have experience from his first term, said Kerri Talbot, executive director of the Immigration Hub, an advocacy group that works with Congress and the administration on a pro-immigrant agenda. Trump\u2019s first-term policies had an impact on businesses that rely on immigrant labor. For instance, it was harder for dairy farmers in Indiana to find workers during his first term, said Steve Obert, a fifth-generation farmer in the state and executive director of Indiana Dairy Producers. If Trump wins the 2024 election and carries out his promise, it will hurt farmers, deport taxpayers and break up families, he said. All of Obert\u2019s 15 non-family employees are foreign born and have work permits. But he knows that undocumented workers contribute a lot to the industry, as well as to the communities where they live. He\u2019s advocating for allowing these folks to work legally so they can live without a cloud over them and so that dairy farmers can build experienced, stable workforces to care for their herds. \u201cYou will absolutely cripple the dairy industry in this country if they send these workers back,\u201d Obert said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/undocumented-immigrants-work-permits-jobs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_new-hampshire-ai-robocall-biden-charges", "text": "New Hampshire prosecutors filed 26 criminal charges against the political consultant behind a robocall that used artificial intelligence to impersonate President Joe Biden and urged voters not to participate in the state\u2019s primary this year. The Federal Communications Commission also imposed a $6 million fine against the consultant, Steve Kramer, because the robocalls used call-spoofing technology that violated federal caller-ID laws. Kramer, 54, was named in several indictments in different New Hampshire counties, according to court documents obtained by CNN. He faces 13 charges of felony voter intimidation or suppression. He also faces 13 counts of impersonating a candidate, which is a misdemeanor, according to the court documents. The indictments, filed by the New Hampshire attorney general, allege that Kramer \u201csent or caused to be sent a pre-recorded phone message that disguised the source of the call, or was deceptive in using an artificially created voice of a candidate, or provided misleading information, in attempting to prevent or deter\u201d voters from participating in the New Hampshire primary. A spokesperson for Kramer declined to comment on the charges. He hasn\u2019t yet entered a plea, and court filings indicate that his arraignments are scheduled for June. CNN affiliate WMUR was first to report on the indictments. The criminal charges have been filed in Merrimack, Rockingham, Grafton and Belknap counties, where some of the voters who received the robocalls reside. Kramer, who worked for Rep. Dean Phillips\u2019 longshot Democratic primary campaign against Biden,\u00a0previously\u00a0admitted\u00a0that he was behind the robocall, which was sent to more than 20,000 voters and urged them to \u201csave\u201d their vote for the November election instead of casting ballots in the January primary.

Mike DeWine said Thursday he was calling the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature into special session next week to fix a timing issue that could keep President Joe Biden from appearing on the state\u2019s general election ballot. Election officials in Ohio have flagged that this summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention, where Biden will be formally renominated, would take place after the state\u2019s August 7 deadline for parties to submit candidates for the ballot. The Democratic convention is scheduled to take place August 19-22, while Republicans are holding their convention in July. DeWine, a Republican, said the Ohio legislature\u2019s failure to address the issue \u2013 something it resolved under similar scenarios in 2012 and 2020 \u2013 was \u201csimply unacceptable.\u201d \u201cOhio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, the sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cThis is a ridiculous, this is absurd, situation.\u201d DeWine said it was \u201cimportant\u201d that Ohioans \u201chave the opportunity to cast a vote for either of the major party candidates\u201d for president, US Senate and other offices. The special session would allow the legislature to address the certification deadline but also to potentially pass a bill, which Democrats oppose, to prevent foreign spending on Ohio ballot measures. Legislative fixes to get Biden on the ballot have been tied up in\u00a0fights\u00a0over the foreign spending issue. The situation in Ohio mirrored a similar one in Republican-controlled Alabama, which was resolved earlier this month when state officials enacted legislation to allow Biden to appear on the state\u2019s fall ballot. The legislation pushed out Alabama\u2019s certification deadline from 82 days before the election to 74 days, giving Democrats time to submit Biden\u2019s name after he formally becomes the nominee at their convention. In recent years, lawmakers and state election officials have quietly resolved certification timeline issues by either enacting legislation to push back the deadline or accepting provisional certifications from political parties. In Ohio, which requires parties to submit the names of their nominees 90 days before the general election, the path forward has been less clear. State officials have said they won\u2019t accept provisional certification. Long a presidential swing state, Ohio has in recent years swung sharply to the right. Donald Trump carried the state by 8 points both in 2016 and 2020. And Ohio Sen.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_alito-flag-new-york-times", "text": "A flag that was on display during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was flown outside\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s vacation home in New Jersey, according to a report in the New York Times on Wednesday. Citing photographs and interviews with neighbors, the Times reports that the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag was seen on display at his property last summer. The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for supporters of former President Donald Trump. The flag is white and includes a green evergreen tree and the words \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d at the top. Alito and the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, who has been a frequent critic of conservative justices, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Thursday that it\u00a0\u201craises\u00a0a serious question\u201d for someone on the nation\u2019s highest court to fly such flags at his residence and vacation home. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence in this second instance. I think he\u2019s speaking pretty clearly as to his political loyalties, and it\u2019s a shame. When it gets right down to it, our courts and justices don\u2019t have an army to enforce their opinions. They don\u2019t have the money to establish an account for media control. What they have is the respect for integrity of the American people,\u201d Durbin said. It\u2019s the second revelation in as many weeks about a controversial display outside Alito\u2019s property. The New York Times last week published a photograph of an inverted American flag raised at Alito\u2019s home in Virginia in 2021.\u00a0Alito said the upside-down US flag was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors. The episode has drawn fire from critics, including\u00a0Democrats and\u00a0key GOP senators,\u00a0who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Like the inverted US flag, the Appeal to Heaven flag \u2014 also known as the Pine Tree flag \u2014 was seen during the attack on the Capitol. House Speaker Mike Johnson faced blowback for displaying the same flag outside his office last year before assuming the leadership post. The Appeal to Heaven flag remains outside his office as of Wednesday. Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s George Washington\u2019s flag.\u00a0It goes back to the founder\u2019s era. I\u2019ve always flown that flag.\u201d \u201cIt has nothing to do with that,\u201d Johnson said, referring to \u201cstop the steal\u201d protests. Alito, along with the other eight justices, appeared on the Supreme Court bench Thursday morning to announce opinions. Two were written by Alito, including in a contentious racial gerrymandering case, and he briefly read synopses of the decisions aloud. Alito typically wears a stern, even dour, expression, and nothing was markedly different Thursday morning. After tersely reading from the text in front of him, Alito took a sip from his tumbler and leaned back in his tall black leather chair as usual. Nothing from him or the other justices betrayed the increasing controversy surrounding the high court. The Alitos\u2019 flag choices are gaining attention in part because several high-profile cases are currently pending before the high court involving the election and subsequent attack on the US Capitol, including the blockbuster question of whether Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. Another case deals with a January 6 defendant who is challenging an obstruction charge filed by federal prosecutors for his role in the attack. Some Republican lawmakers defended Alito on Wednesday, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz telling CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins that the \u201centire hoopla is greatly overstated\u201d and accusing Senate Democrats of trying to delegitimize the court. \u201cFrom the far left, the court is the one institution that they do not control,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan echoed those sentiments, pushing back on criticism of Alito and two other conservative justices. \u201cJustice\u00a0Alito\u00a0is an outstanding justice. The left is always out to go after him, Judge Thomas \u2014 of course, we know what they\u2019ve done to Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d Jordan told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cThey\u2019re all good guys, have done a good job on the court.\u201d He added that Alito should not recuse himself from the January 6 case.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_trump-hush-money-trial-venue", "text": "A panel of New York State appellate judges denied Donald Trump\u2019s appeal to move his criminal trial \u2014\u00a0which has been going on for six weeks \u2014 out of Manhattan to another county. The panel denied the appeal with no further explanation in a short ruling Thursday as summations are scheduled for next Tuesday in the seventh week of Trump\u2019s criminal trial tied to an alleged hush money scheme ahead of the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s lawyers had first filed the appeal on the last day of jury selection last month, and\u00a0the routine procedure for a full review\u00a0of the appeal took several weeks to complete, as expected. It\u2019s one of two Trump motions denied by the appeals courts Thursday. The denials close the loop on Trump motions that were included in a blitz of strategic appellate actions aimed at delaying the trial before it got underway last month. All of Trump\u2019s emergency appellate requests to delay the trial were denied at the time, and since then, the court has denied Trump\u2019s motions on the underlying issues. Both the prosecution and Trump\u2019s defense have rested in the Manhattan criminal trial and the jury is set to hear closing arguments next Tuesday following the Memorial Day weekend break. A single appellate judge had denied Trump\u2019s request to stop the trial in its tracks pending a decision on the venue appeal during an emergency hearing held on the same day the jury panel was finalized last month. At the hearing, Trump\u2019s attorney Cliff Robert said seating a jury in three days after so many prospective jurors were dismissed for cause over bias is \u201cuntenable.\u201d A lawyer arguing for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office said the robust process that resulted in the culling of so many prospective jurors showed \u201cjury selection has worked.\u201d Trump had unsuccessfully appealed with the same request for a stay over the change of venue motion the week before, and renewed the request at the end of jury selection, arguing there was a record of bias in the prospective jury pool. A different panel of judges from the appeals court on Thursday denied another outstanding petition from Trump\u2019s lawyers that challenged Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s pretrial rulings on his recusal, motion filing procedures and presidential immunity. Five days before the trial got underway, Trump\u2019s lawyers had asked the appeals court to delay the trial pending an appellate ruling on these issues. That request was denied after an emergency hearing on April 10, and the order issued on Thursday now dismisses the petition. In the order filed Thursday, the panel found that Trump\u2019s legal arguments failed to establish that Merchan overstepped in the pretrial rulings to warrant action from the appellate court at this stage. Trump can ask the appeals court to consider the issues in a direct appeal after a final judgment in the trial, the ruling says. \u201cExercise of such discretion would not be warranted in this case, where relief would interfere with the normal trial and appellate procedures, and, without opining on the merits, the matters herein identified by petitioner may be raised in a direct appeal.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/trump-hush-money-trial-venue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trump-cohen-costello-drama-analysis", "text": "Twelve New Yorkers are on deck. As Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial races toward its climax, his attorneys are previewing how they will beseech a jury next week to spare their client the shame of being the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. On a wild day in court Monday, Judge Juan Merchan accused one disrespectful defense witness of trying to stare him down, while the ex-president\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen, sensationally admitted to stealing thousands of dollars from his old boss\u2019 firm. But beneath the uproar, there is also a clear sense that this trial \u2013 which is intertwined with the country\u2019s future, given Trump\u2019s bid to reclaim the White House \u2013 is now in its fateful endgame. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s lawyers made a long-shot bid for the dismissal of his first criminal trial before the jury has even been asked to deliberate. The gambit is a familiar one for defense teams that rarely works, but it offered a glimpse into the narrative Trump\u2019s lawyers will place before the jury, likely next Tuesday, after the Memorial Day holiday. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, argued prosecutors had failed to prove their case that Trump intended to mislead voters in 2016 by falsifying financial records to disguise a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. And he implored Merchan not to hand jurors a case so reliant on testimony from Cohen, a confessed liar. With the jury out of the room, Merchan took several stabs at getting it straight. He said: \u201cYou want me to take it out of the jury\u2019s hands and decide before it even gets to the jury, that as a matter of law, this person is so not worthy of belief that it shouldn\u2019t be considered by the jury?\u201d Blanche replied: \u201cWe didn\u2019t just catch him in a lie, your honor, he came in here with a history of lying.\u201d The judge hardly seemed impressed. \u201cYou said his lies are \u2018irrefutable\u2019; that you think he\u2019s going to fool 12 New Yorkers into believing this lie?\u201d Merchan said. Blanche answered: \u201cI certainly hope he doesn\u2019t convince 12 jurors.\u201d The judge said he\u2019d consider the request, but it would be a major surprise if anything now happens to prevent the jury from getting the case. Trump cranks up his strategy to discredit the trial before a verdict Trump, meanwhile, escalated his inside-outside courtroom strategy that has turned his four criminal indictments into a rationale for his bid to win back the White House. He lashed out at Merchan in the corridor while surrounded by another posse of Republican Party supplicants. \u201cThis case should be dropped by the judge. I think the judge, if he did that, would gain the respect back,\u201d Trump said, insisting \u201cthere was no crime\u201d and again complaining about a courtroom he called a \u201cfreezing cold ice box.\u201d Trump has denied the affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case, as he has in all others against him. The prosecution rested its case Monday, after trying to rehabilitate the sometimes rocky testimony of Cohen, the self-described former Trump \u201cthug\u201d who once wrote that he knew where the ex-president\u2019s skeletons were buried because he did the burying. Barring an 11th hour change of heart, it appears that the former president himself won\u2019t testify in his own defense \u2014 in what would be a sound legal decision as he\u2019d almost certain make the case all about himself again after his lawyers spent days trying to make it about Cohen\u2019s questionable credibility. Key developments Monday\u2019s court action at times threatened to spin out of control \u2014 in a way that only a Trump trial can. But several key developments underscored the way the case is headed inexorably toward a jury deliberation that will keep the country on edge. The prosecution\u2019s main task was to try to repair damage to Cohen\u2019s credibility and to stress to the jury \u2014 and to the judge in the back-and-forth over the motion to dismiss \u2014 that the case was about far more than Trump\u2019s former fixer. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued that the foundation of evidence presented in court before Cohen\u2019s testimony corroborated what he had to say. Colangelo said that \u201cat minimum, a reasonable juror could conclude the invoices, the ledger entries, the signed checks with check stubs \u2014 all contain false information.\u201d And he argued there was an \u201coverwhelming record of concealment\u201d that supports an intent to defraud on Trump\u2019s part. Until Cohen entered a bruising cross-examination last week, the case appeared to be going well for the prosecution. But the witness who was always a big risk turned into a potentially case-derailing disaster. He was confronted with evidence that called into question his testimony under oath about speaking with Trump on October 24, 2016, to tell him the hush money payment scheme was going according to plan. The defense presented Cohen with text messages he had sent to Trump\u2019s bodyguard Keith Schiller, who was with Trump at the time,\u00a0just before the call, suggesting the conversation was about an entirely different matter. The implication was that Cohen didn\u2019t speak to Trump about the hush money payment, raising questions about his fixer\u2019s truthfulness. The defense is implying that if Cohen cannot be trusted on this detail, his entire testimony implicating Trump cannot be believed. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger on Monday tried to clean up some of Cohen\u2019s mess. \u201cI know it may feel like you\u2019re on trial here after cross-examination, but are you actually on trial?\u201d she asked Cohen. \u201cNo ma\u2019am,\u201d said the man who once said he idolized Trump. But Cohen may have further damaged his standing with jurors earlier in the day when he admitted that he stole $60,000 from the Trump Organization. His admission, about a cut he took from a payment to a tech company and a subsequent reimbursement with interest from his boss\u2019 firm, caused Blanche to ask: \u201cDid you ever have to plead guilty to larceny?\u201d which drew a smirk from Trump. Some legal commentators suggested this episode was another bombshell shattering  Cohen\u2019s credibility. But others argued that it was just another data point for jurors who would have few illusions about Cohen\u2019s character after he admitted to repeatedly lying on his own and Trump\u2019s account. \u201cWhat is portrayed in the media is not what the jurors are ever going to see if they are following the judge\u2019s instructions not to look at any stories on TV or read anything about this. It\u2019s another piece of information for them to consider,\u201d retired judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Courtroom chaos Veteran lawyers and court reporters said they\u2019d never seen anything like the scene precipitated by defense witness Robert Costello. The lawyer who had advised Cohen was called to the stand to testify for the defense, but it didn\u2019t take long for him to get on the wrong side of Merchan. When the judge sustained an objection to a defense question, Costello let out an audible \u201cjeez,\u201d prompting the judge to lean forward and say, \u201cSorry?\u201d Costello\u2019s disdain was evident again when the same thing happened shortly afterward and the judge asked the jury to leave the courtroom. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a side eye and you don\u2019t roll your eyes,\u201d the judge warned. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a witness on the stand, if you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019 you don\u2019t say strike it,\u201d Merchan said. Costello replied with a glare. \u201cAre you staring me down?\u201d Merchan asked before clearing the courtroom. Costello\u2019s behavior was a stunning show of disrespect for a judge in his own courtroom \u2014 and the first part of it was visible to jurors. \u201cI don\u2019t think this witness really helped this defense at all,\u201d Cordell told Tapper. \u201cMy guess, maybe they called this witness because their client wanted them to do that. He really didn\u2019t add anything and really created more of a problem than a help,\u201d she said. Predictably, the ultimate chaos agent enjoyed the disruption. Trump told reporters after court wrapped for the day: \u201cYou saw what happened to a highly respected lawyer today, Bob Costello. Wow. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d Former long-time trial attorney Terri Austin agreed. \u201cIn all my years of practice, over 30 plus, I\u2019ve never seen a moment like this,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. It\u2019s a superlative worn out by repetition ever since Trump descended the golden escalator in 2015 at his eponymous skyscraper not far from the Manhattan courtroom. And whatever happens in the coming days, we\u2019ll likely hear it again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-cohen-costello-drama-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_aid-gaza-us-pier", "text": "Aid groups have begun distributing the humanitarian assistance offloaded at the US pier in Gaza to Palestinians, after encountering significant obstacles on distribution routes including Hamas drones and looting that delayed the deliveries. More than 500 metric tons of food and other humanitarian aid offloaded at the pier has\u00a0now\u00a0been handed off to humanitarian partners, and\u00a0two-thirds of that aid has distributed to or is in the process of reaching those in need, a top\u00a0US Agency for International Development (USAID)\u00a0official told reporters on a call Thursday. The distribution comes several days after the US military\u2019s pier operation launched and got off to a rocky start. Aid\u00a0deliveries from the pier to warehouses inside Gaza were initially hindered by a Hamas drone attack on the IDF \u201cseveral miles away\u201d from the pier that led to a freeze on convoy movements, and some trucks were looted along one of the distribution paths earlier this week,\u00a0Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of United States Central Command, said in a call with reporters on Thursday. As a result, the US\u00a0military\u00a0had to help USAID come up with alternative, safer routes for trucks leaving the marshaling area on the beach near the pier and traveling to the warehouses. \u201cSuch challenges with internal distribution are not new or unique to aid delivery from the sea,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut these atmospherics, I think, give you some sense of the operating environment.\u201d More than 1,000 US troops helped to build the humanitarian pier and causeway off the coast of Gaza over the last two months, and the operation launched last week.\u00a0By Tuesday, however, the Pentagon said that none of the aid that had been unloaded from the pier had yet been delivered to the broader Palestinian population. The maritime corridor, officials have emphasized,\u00a0is meant to supplement land crossings into Gaza that have frequently been closed or bottlenecked by Israeli inspections. The US military\u00a0is also going to continue airdropping aid into Gaza, Cooper confirmed. According to Daniel Dieckhaus, director for USAID\u2019s Levant Response Management Team, the aid that has been distributed \u201cis sufficient food to feed tens of thousands of people for a month.\u201d However, the situation in Gaza is incredibly dire, with the entire population facing food insecurity and parts of the war-torn strip already experiencing famine. There are also shortages of fuel, which aid groups need to be able to distribute the critically needed assistance. \u201cAt no point have we ever postulated that the pier would be a replacement for any border crossing and nor was it ever intended to be \u2014 it was intended to be additive,\u201d Dieckhaus\u00a0said on the call. On Wednesday, \u201c27 trucks with more than 185 metric tons moved from the marshaling area on the beach of Gaza for onward distribution,\u201d\u00a0USAID\u00a0said\u00a0in an update to reporters.\u00a0Dieckhaus said Thursday that there are \u201cthousands and thousands of tons\u201d of aid in Cyprus awaiting processing to be brought across the pier. Some land crossings into Gaza, meanwhile, remain open. On Wednesday, \u201cthe UN reported 215 private sector trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and 115 humanitarian assistance trucks through Zikim/Erez West,\u201d USAID said. The agency noted that Rafah and Erez East remained closed and \u201cthe humanitarian situation remains dire.\u201d \u201cWe continue to work with humanitarian partners to scale up and sustain urgently needed assistance to meet growing humanitarian needs in Gaza. Much more must be done to save lives and alleviate the widespread suffering of civilians in Gaza, and the United States will continue our efforts to surge assistance in via every avenue,\u201d the agency said. On Thursday, Cooper also confirmed to reporters that three US service members had sustained non-combat-related injures on the pier mission. Two US troops were taken to a local Israeli hospital with minor injuries \u2014 a sprained ankle and injured back, Cooper said, describing them as \u201croutine injuries.\u201d They have since returned to duty. But a US defense official said Thursday that another service member is in critical condition after being injured while working aboard the USNS Benavidez in support of the mission. The critically injured service member was also taken to a medical facility in Israel, the official said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/aid-gaza-us-pier/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_donald-trump-bronx-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally Thursday in the Bronx as his campaign looks to make inroads with Hispanic and Black voters ahead of November\u2019s election. The event in one of the most Democratic counties in the country comes days ahead of closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York criminal hush money trial. Trump faces 34 felony counts and has pleaded not guilty. The trial has tethered the former president to New York for much of the past six weeks, but Thursday\u2019s event in Crotona Park in the South Bronx will be Trump\u2019s first major campaign rally in the state since his initial presidential run in 2016. Trump has visited a bodega, which was the scene of a fatal stabbing in 2022, a construction site and a fire station in Manhattan since his trial began in mid-April. A Trump campaign official told CNN that several factors, including the former president\u2019s long history of living and working in New York and his efforts to win over minority voters, played into the decision to hold the Bronx rally. The official said that the area\u2019s proximity to Trump\u2019s criminal trial was also a consideration, as was the former president\u2019s desire to \u201cchallenge the status quo\u201d in a state that has long voted for Democrats. Trump has insisted that he has a shot this fall at winning New York, which a Republican presidential nominee has not carried since 1984. The Bronx is a Democratic stronghold, which Trump lost by about 68 points to Joe Biden in 2020. That margin, however, was down from four years earlier, when Hillary Clinton carried the county by 79 points. Trump\u2019s improvement was even greater in the South Bronx, where Thursday\u2019s rally is taking place. Biden won the election district (or precinct) surrounding Crotona Park by 69 points. Clinton carried the same precinct by more than 90 points in 2016. Trump\u2019s performance in the Bronx in 2020 mirrored his results in other areas where Hispanic voters make up a substantial portion of the electorate. Residents in the South Bronx are mainly Hispanic (64%) and Black (31%), according to the US Census Bureau. Polling this year shows Trump may do even better among Hispanic and Black voters than he did four years ago. Surveys taken since the beginning of April show Biden\u2019s margin among these voters down double digits compared with surveys from the same point in 2020. This is likely part of the reason why the Biden campaign launched two new ads Thursday aimed at highlighting what it called \u201cTrump\u2019s long record of failures and broken promises\u201d to Black Americans. The spots point out that Trump was sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s and charged with discriminating against African Americans; promoted the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US;\u00a0pushed for the death penalty for five minority teenagers who were wrongly accused and convicted of beating and raping a woman in Central Park in the 1980s; and \u201cstood with violent White supremacists\u201d in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The Trump campaign said the ads represented an attempt to \u201cgaslight Black voters.\u201d \u201cWe must not forget that it was Joe Biden who was a key figure in passing the 1994 Crime Bill, which disproportionately harmed Black communities through harsh sentencing laws and increased incarceration rates. Additionally, we cannot overlook that Biden\u2019s policies are driving Black families deeper into poverty and making them less safe,\u201d Janiyah Thomas, the campaign\u2019s Black media director, said in a statement. Several House Republicans from New York said they could no longer make it to Trump\u2019s event due to changes in the chamber\u2019s voting schedule Thursday. \u201cNew York is in play and we had all planned to be there to greet him and attend this historic event. However, the House schedule changed and we will be voting to ban illegal immigrants from voting in elections and to protect American\u2019s right to financial privacy,\u201d House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, seen as a potential Trump running mate,\u00a0said in a joint statement with seven other lawmakers. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ritchie Torres, who represent parts of the Bronx, blasted the former president\u2019s upcoming event. Ocasio-Cortez, in an interview with NY1, called it an \u201cattempt to, I think, trick some of our folks here,\u201d while Torres told The New York Times that Trump was \u201cradioactive\u201d in the Bronx. Trump\u2019s outreach to minority voters also comes as the former president has made stoking fears about undocumented migrants a cornerstone of his campaign. He has regularly made false or misleading claims about illegal immigration and\u00a0used dehumanizing language when referring to migrants.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_nikki-haley-biden-trump", "text": "A Biden campaign official met Wednesday night with\u00a0Nikki Haley\u00a0supporters from across several states in a pre-scheduled Zoom call hours after the former Republican presidential candidate said\u00a0she would be voting\u00a0for Donald Trump, two sources familiar with the call told CNN. The meeting was part of an ongoing effort by the Biden campaign to reach out to Haley voters. It was organized by the Haley Voters Working Group. Conservative Haley backers from Virginia, Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Florida, Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina joined the call, including members of Haley\u2019s former state leadership teams and the organization\u00a0Women for Nikki. The call, which one source characterized as a constructive initial step, began with a Q&A session for about 35 minutes with the Biden campaign official, who wanted to know which policy issues were most important to the Haley supporters. Another source confirmed that the official on the call was Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, the deputy political director for President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. After Pe\u00f1alosa left the call, the source said the conversation continued among the group, with a \u201cfew moments of mourning\u201d over Haley\u2019s decision to back Trump along with a recognition that it wasn\u2019t a full-throated endorsement. \u201cTrump would be\u00a0smart\u00a0to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d\u00a0Haley\u00a0said Wednesday at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington. Robert Schwartz, the executive director of the Haley Voters Working Group, said that despite the disappointment over the former South Carolina governor saying she would vote for Trump, there was an understanding that this was a choice she was likely to make. \u201cA lot of these people in this group are big supporters of Nikki Haley and want to support her in 2028,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re legit Republicans and conservatives, and so they don\u2019t want to see Trump destroy the party.\u201d As some Republican voters continue to show support for Haley in primaries since she left the presidential race in March, the Biden campaign is focused on expanding its outreach and talking to these voters, especially in battleground states. The campaign stressed to CNN that this is part of a larger outreach program targeting GOP voters, which will include dedicated staff and grassroots-driven efforts as the general election approaches. The campaign issued a press release Thursday afternoon entitled \u201cTo Haley Voters: There\u2019s a Home For You on Team Biden-Harris.\u201d \u201cWhile Donald Trump continues to attack moderate Republican and independent voters, the Biden campaign is investing to talk to these voters and working to earn their support,\u201d the release read. Schwartz concurred with that sentiment. \u201cWhile Trump has done absolutely nothing to gain the support of Haley voters and takes them for granted, Biden and his campaign are actively reaching out to build a coalition of Republicans and they know they need to earn their vote. We welcome their initial engagements and know they plan to do much more in the coming months,\u201d he said. On the call Wednesday, the Haley voters raised some of their pressing policy concerns with Pe\u00f1alosa, including the southern border, Ukraine and Israel. One Haley supporter from Arizona expressed a desire for an executive order or some type of strong action from Biden to address the US-Mexico border. The Daily Beast\u00a0was first to report\u00a0on the Zoom call.

{"id": "2024_04_13_politics_questions-trump-trial-answered-what-matters", "text": "When CNN asked for your questions about former President Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial \u2013 for his role in hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women who said they had affairs with him \u2013 we got a flood of input. Not all of it was fit to print. But there were a lot of legitimate and very thoughtful questions, which we\u2019ve updated now that the defense and prosecution have both rested and jurors may begin deliberations as soon as May 28. Keep reading for a representative sampling, which helps explain the case, along with context from CNN\u2019s reporters and coverage. Most of the questions come directly from reader submissions, but for others, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of simplifying multiple submissions into one question. Trump, by the way, denies having the affairs and has pleaded not guilty in the case. I went to CNN\u2019s chief legal analyst Laura Coates for the single, most-asked question, which was asked in many ways but boils down to: Could Trump actually go to jail? Coates: If Trump were to be found guilty of all of the counts, he could theoretically be facing more than a decade in prison.\u00a0The 34 felony counts are classified as Class E felonies in New York, the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty for each of those counts is four years; however New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years.\u00a0It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to decide whether those sentences would run concurrently or consecutively. Because the crimes involve nonviolent offenses and Trump does not have a criminal record, the judge could also consider jailing him for a period that is but a fraction of the maximum penalty. Another possibility is that the judge could forego prison entirely and place him on probation with the possibility of incarceration looming over his head if he fails to abide by the conditions set by the judge. If the judge should decide to incarcerate post-conviction, Secret Service would become the elephant in the, well, cell.\u00a0The unprecedented nature of incarcerating a former president would raise questions about how best to ensure equal treatment under the law and security for a former president. Watch Coates\u2019 show weeknights at 11 p.m. ET where she\u2019ll answer a lot more of your questions. I reached out to the Secret Service to ask if they had planned for the potential that Trump could be imprisoned. Not surprisingly, I was told by a spokesman that this is \u201csomething we can not comment on at this time.\u201d But note that as a matter of US law, former presidents and their spouses are afforded lifetime Secret Service protection, unless they decline it. This is ultimately a question of strategy. But testimony in previous proceedings has not gone well for Weisselberg, the former, longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. He is currently indisposed at Rikers Island, a prison in New York, where he\u2019s serving time for admitting to perjury in the civil fraud trial that ended in a more than $400 million judgement against Trump for inflating his net worth to get friendly loan terms. Prosecutors told Judge Juan Merchan they did not attempt to compel Weisselberg\u2019s testimony in this trial even though he played a crucial role in payments to Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen. Defense lawyers said Weisselberg was not available to either side for testimony and would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if called. Look for jurors to be given instructions about how to view testimony they heard about Weisselberg. There is strong evidence that the campaign was in a state of panic after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in 2016. There is strong evidence from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the desire to help Trump\u2019s campaign by finding and neutralizing damaging stories. It\u2019s clear that Cohen organized payments for Stormy Daniels, a woman who claimed an affair with Trump, and that he took out a loan to make them happen. But Cohen is the only witness who said that Trump specifically made payments to Cohen to reimburse him for the payments to Daniels. Jurors will have to believe Cohen, an admitted liar and felon, that the payments were improper reimbursement and not simply lawyer fees. A unanimous vote is required for either conviction or acquittal. Anything short of a unanimous verdict would be a hung jury. The judge will try very hard to get the jury to reach a unanimous verdict.  A hung jury might be perceived as a net win for Trump since prosecutors would have to ponder whether to try him again on the same charges and there\u2019s little chance it would happen before Election Day. The former first lady has not attended any of her husband\u2019s criminal trial, although many of Trump\u2019s political allies \u2013 senators, House members and more \u2013 have shown their support by attending some of the arguments. Trump\u2019s son with Melania, Barron Trump, graduated from high school in Florida during the trial and the judge canceled arguments that day so that the former president could attend the ceremony. Given that the trial included testimony from Daniels about her alleged affair \u2013 which Trump has denied \u2013 it is perhaps not surprising that Melania Trump would decide not to attend the proceedings. First, Trump never signed a check to Daniels, and that is a major element of the case. Cohen engineered the hush money payment when he could not get the National Enquirer to foot the bill. Cohen took out a line of credit on his apartment to come up with the cash. Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen after Trump won the White House were, according to Cohen, to pay him back for the Daniels payments, plus a bonus, and for other things like a bogus poll Cohen engineered. Second, Trump did claim to give up control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., when he was in the White House. But the arrangement was universally criticized by ethics experts. Trump maintained his ownership stake in the business. Some of his payments to Cohen were made from accounts associated with the trust set up to hold the Trump Organization while Trump was president. Other payments were made from a personal bank account, but all the payments were processed by the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors. Trump isn\u2019t technically accused of having an affair, which he denies and which is not illegal. The hush money itself, represented by a contract between two parties, is not necessarily illegal either. Hush money was paid by the Trump-supporting publisher of the National Enquirer to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and, separately, it was paid by Cohen to Daniels. But in this case, the payments, which were intended to hide details from voters before the 2016 election, violated campaign finance law. National Enquirer\u2019s parent company admitted wrongdoing, and Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign law and served time in prison. Federal prosecutors, as a matter of Department of Justice policy, were unable to prosecute Trump for the payments when he was president and decided not to bring charges after he left office. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg then brought this case. Trump is accused of falsifying business records (a New York state crime) in an effort to use illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 campaign (a federal crime). Yes. This is an important element of the case. Falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor. The felony charge here is falsifying business records to further another crime. And this is where the case against Trump gets unique. The other crime is a campaign finance violation to which Cohen has already pleaded guilty. It is a state crime made a felony by furthering a federal crime. Federal prosecutors, by the way, decided not to pursue charges against Trump with regard to the campaign finance violation. Jurors heard testimony about how nervous Trump\u2019s campaign was after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was published and they desperately wanted to tamp down on any unflattering stories. Trump\u2019s defense is that he did not want the Daniels story to be published because he wanted to keep the information from his wife. Nothing about any of this is normal. Trump\u2019s stated legal strategy is to delay legal proceedings as much as possible in the hope that they do not conclude before the presidential election. It\u2019s a strategy that so far is paying off in federal court. His federal election interference case is stalled until the US Supreme Court rules on what most people consider to be a ridiculous total immunity argument. His federal trial on classified documents is on indefinite hold in Miami. His trial in Fulton County, Georgia, on state election interference allegations has been delayed by allegations of impropriety in the personal life of the DA bringing the case. This is a great and essentially unanswerable hypothetical. First, it assumes multiple things will occur: Trump would have to be convicted, sentenced, exhaust appeals, report to prison and win the election. That\u2019s a very specific scenario thrust upon a very unpredictable set of circumstances and a short timeline. I talked to Frank Bowman, a law professor emeritus at the University of Missouri who is both an expert in criminal law and published a book on the impeachment process, for his thoughts on how to deal with a convict president. The Constitution, he said, theoretically allows a person to serve \u201ceven if he\u2019s a convicted felon or even if he\u2019s a convicted felon in the joint.\u201d Timing, however, would get in the way of this hypothetical ever occurring. \u201cThis stuff takes a long time, and the appeals would drag out,\u201d probably beyond Election Day and Inauguration Day, Bowman said. It\u2019s also possible Trump\u2019s opponents, after a conviction, could try again to either impeach him or object to his presidency based on the 14th Amendment, although those avenues have been tried and failed previously. If somehow Trump was convicted in this state case, Bowman imagined there could be some argument by which the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause \u2013 which prohibits states from interfering in the exercise of constitutional powers \u2013 could be utilized to keep Trump from state prison. But it would be a novel thing. If, on the other hand, Trump was somehow convicted in one of his two federal trials and sentenced to federal prison, as president he could theoretically try to pardon himself or order the Bureau of Prisons to do something like confine him at the White House. Again, this is uncharted territory that is unanticipated in US law and, Bowman argues, unlikely to occur.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_senate-border-bill-vote", "text": "A sweeping bipartisan border security bill failed to advance in the Senate on Thursday, blocked by GOP opposition and Democratic divisions. Democrats brought the measure back up after it failed earlier this year in an attempt to put pressure on Senate Republicans and shift the narrative on border security, but the bill exposed divides among Democrats as some came out against it, threatening to undermine the party\u2019s messaging effort. The vote was 43 to 50. As\u00a0immigration\u00a0remains top of mind for voters, the White House and top congressional Democrats have discussed a series of moves aimed at strengthening their hand on border security ahead of the first presidential debate next month.\u00a0Sources say those talks\u00a0included reviving the stalled border security measure\u00a0that\u00a0initially failed after former President Donald Trump told GOP lawmakers to knock it down. Democrats have pointed to the failure of the bill \u2013 which was negotiated on a bipartisan basis \u2013 to argue that Republicans are not serious about trying to fix problems at the southern border\u00a0and are ready to ramp up that argument after the bill stalled out a second time. But without Ukraine tied to the measure, some Democrats and immigrant advocates are casting it as purely political and taking issue with key elements of the bill \u2013 one of the toughest border measures in recent memory. Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who was one of the lead negotiators on the bipartisan border bill, delivered a scathing speech ahead of the vote on the Senate floor where she criticized both sides of the aisle for \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d Sinema, who voted against the bill this time around, argued that border communities in Arizona are in dire need of real policy solutions and that playing politics with the issue erodes trust in Congress and forces \u201cboth parties further to the fringes.\u201d There were also new Democratic defections in this vote on the border bill. \u201cI will not vote for the bill coming to the Senate floor this week because it includes several provisions that will violate Americans\u2019 shared values. These provisions would not make us safe,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday. Booker voted to advance the bill in February when it failed 49-50. In his statement, Booker noted that the first time around the bill also included \u201ccritical foreign and humanitarian aid.\u201d Republicans have largely dismissed the vote as a political move for vulnerable Democrats to seek political cover over a major issue in the run-up to the November elections. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer acknowledged over the weekend that not every Democrat may vote for the bill in\u00a0a letter to colleagues.\u00a0Sixty votes are needed to break a GOP filibuster attempt.\u00a0Democrats only have 51 votes total and most Republicans have already said they plan to vote against the effort. The border bill was a topic of discussion Tuesday during Democrats\u2019 closed door party lunch as members debated the merits of bringing up a bill that has already failed to advance in the Senate. A source in the room told CNN that the vast majority were supportive, but that there were holdouts. Sen. Alex Padilla, who opposed the bill the first time around, said he will vote against the bill when it comes to the floor on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s also not lost on me that the last time we were here, a lot of people mentioned this was the price they were willing to pay for the sake of Ukraine funding. That is no longer the case,\u201d Padilla said, acknowledging that something needs to be done to address the border. \u201cThis should not be the Democratic starting point for border security.\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner said the fact there may be\u00a0internal\u00a0backlash incentivizes some moderates: \u201cFrankly, the fact that some of our most progressive members don\u2019t vote for it, in my mind, is an indication that it really was a true bipartisan, tough bill,\u201d he said. If passed, the bill would dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.\u00a0It includes, for example, a new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach a certain level, raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum and expedites the asylum processing timeline, among other measures. Most Republicans view the vote as largely a messaging exercise for Democrats. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters on Thursday she plans to vote against advancing the border bill after voting for the previous effort. \u201cIf\u00a0it were a serious effort, we wouldn\u2019t be voting at two o\u2019clock on Thursday right as everyone\u2019s rushing out of town,\u201d she said. But Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who previously voted for the bill, indicated she\u00a0could\u00a0back the bill again, despite calling the process \u201cdumb.\u201d \u201cIf I thought it was good enough to vote for before, what changed?\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cExplain what is going on to someone who is not in this building. They think we\u2019re nuts.\u201d But Republican Sen. James Lankford, a key negotiator on the border bill, said he\u2019ll vote against the measure Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a bill. It\u2019s a prop,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Tuesday. Democrats have sought to shift blame onto Republicans for not securing the border, citing their decision to walk away from a measure that restricted migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the US southern border, among other restrictions. The message became a winning one in New York\u2019s third congressional district in February when\u00a0Democratic\u00a0Rep. Tom Suozzi went on offense on immigration and won the seat. The absence of foreign aid and inclusion of what some immigrant advocates describe as sharp policy has turned up the volume on criticism. \u201cIt is unconscionable and deeply disappointing for Senator Murphy to be championing these policies that will simply not work, and for Leader Schumer, the senator from the home to the Statue of Liberty, to be pushing for this vote,\u201d Robyn\u00a0Barnard,\u00a0senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, told CNN. \u201cThe American public were told these harsh policies were necessary to secure Ukraine funding earlier in the year, what is their excuse for adopting anti-immigrant policies now?\u201d Barnard said. The pressure on Congress also reflects the limited tools the administration has at its disposal to affect the situation on the ground over the next few months. \u201cWe recognize that there are limits to what any administration can do in this space with executive action,\u201d one senior administration official said. \u201cWhat we really need here and we continue to call for is for Congress to do its job and to take up and pass the Senate bipartisan border security legislation.\u201d Senior administration officials are bracing for the potential that border crossings will surge this summer, like in previous years and\u00a0are trotting out a series of policy changes to try to dissuade migrants from journeying to the US \u2013 and convince skeptical voters they are working to tighten up immigration at the border. \u201cAll of the factors that have been driving this unprecedented movement of people all over the world remain and we continue to be very vigilant and work, night and day to try to put policies in place that will mitigate its impact on our border,\u201d this senior official said. Discussions are ongoing on rolling out a border executive action, according to sources, who say that one of the considerations is doing so after Mexico\u2019s election in early June and potentially before the first presidential debate. It\u2019s all part of a broader strategy to remind voters they have a plan, Democrats say. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some pretty encouraging polling that indicates that once people know what we have the strongest, bipartisan border bill in generations and we are prepared to do real and tough things that moderates are willing to change their view about Democrats and border security,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bill and it is something that needs attending to. That\u2019s our job. Let\u2019s bring it up,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Maine\u00a0Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_republicans-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Top Republicans are already rushing to buy into a new 2024 election fraud narrative sown by ex-President Donald Trump in their zeal to appease their party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Leading\u00a0party figures are increasingly warning they will only recognize the result of November\u2019s presidential vote if there is no fraud. But there is no indication that there will be irregularities in the election. And their warnings come despite many Republican state legislatures taking steps to tighten voting rules \u2014 based on Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in 2020. The new Republican trend of casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election in advance was exhibited by Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. The Texas lawmaker, who in 2016\u00a0fell in\u00a0line behind Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s insults about his father and his wife, falsely stated that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of voting irregularities, multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, rejected the former president\u2019s claims he was cheated out of power. And Trump\u2019s then-attorney general, William Barr, looked into his claims and decided that there was no widespread fraud that would have changed the result of the election. But Cruz told Collins that a question about whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election was \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time.\u201d Cruz, who objected to election results in Arizona, which Trump narrowly lost to Biden, on January 6, 2021, went on to suggest there was significant fraud in 2020. And he implied the same could happen this year. \u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz said. A sign of Trump\u2019s power The equivocating of senior Republicans appears motivated by a fear of crossing Trump, the twice-impeached GOP leader who has the power to end careers in the party simply by turning against an individual lawmaker. The positioning looks a lot like laying the groundwork for a challenge to the fairness of the 2024 election if Trump loses in November. Undermining an election even before it happens represents a grave threat to democracy. The attempt to raise the specter of election fraud this year is especially corrosive because of the likelihood that the 2024 vote will be decided in a handful of swing states by mere thousands of ballots and raises the possibility of prolonged legal action by Trump\u2019s camp that would tarnish yet another US election. Trump is still claiming falsely that Mike Pence had the constitutional authority power to overturn the 2020 election result, and the former vice president has been largely ostracized within his party for following the Constitution and overseeing the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Cruz is just the latest senior party figure to try to avoid getting on the wrong side of Trump when asked whether they will accept the result of the 2024 election. The attempt to win Trump\u2019s favor follows an interview that Trump gave to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper earlier this month. \u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results. I don\u2019t change on that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d His comments carried the implicit threat that he will decide if he loses, as he did in 2020, that the election was not fair. Trump frequently claims he did better in the popular vote four years ago than any incumbent president, creating a false argument that it was therefore impossible to lose to Biden, who got more votes. Trump\u2019s renewed election denialism is disturbing for several reasons. First, it mirrors his pre-election spin in 2020, when he suggested that the election might not be fair \u2014 which he later built upon after losing to Biden with a widespread campaign that culminated in the mob attack by his supporters on the Capitol\u00a0that was\u00a0designed to thwart the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Trump often leaves the impression that any election he loses cannot, by definition, be legitimate. His false claims about election fraud in 2020 are now believed by millions of Republican voters despite the fact that he has been indicted twice \u2014 in a federal case and in Georgia \u2014 for his attempts to steal the election and stay in power. Comments like Cruz\u2019s on Wednesday serve to create an expectation among some voters that the coming election will not be fair, even though there is no indication that this, or any other US election, will be tarnished by fraud,\u00a0which historically has only taken place at very low levels. Republican senators try to demonstrate loyalty to Trump The Texas senator is far from the first senior party figure to buy into Trump\u2019s claims,\u00a0a trend that shows the sheer power of Trump in the GOP. It also follows the announcement by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Wednesday that she will vote for Trump despite having called him \u201cunhinged\u201d and unfit to serve in the Oval Office again during her primary campaign earlier this year. Her move appeared to be an attempt to retain viability in the Republican Party for any future run for president. It seems like it should be easy for Republicans just to state that they will accept the result of the 2024 election and that US presidential votes in the modern era have not been tainted by fraud. But they can\u2019t seem to do it. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in 2016 but has since adopted Trumpian positions, was asked Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether he would accept the result of the election \u201cno matter what happens.\u201d He replied: \u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested by either side.\u201d He claimed that Democrats have \u201copposed every Republican victory since 2000\u201d and added: \u201cIf it\u2019s unfair, we are going to do the same thing Democrats do \u2026 we\u2019re going to use lawyers to go to court and point out the fact that states are not following their own election laws.\u201d Rubio\u2019s comment is misleading because, while there were some claims by small groups of Democrats that the elections of 2004 and 2016 featured some fraud, the Democratic candidates in each case quickly conceded to Republicans,\u00a0unlike Trump, who has never accepted that he lost. The 2000 election was contested by Republicans and Democrats over a recount controversy in Florida, the pivotal state. The Democratic candidate,\u00a0then-Vice President\u00a0Al Gore, eventually conceded after the case was adjudicated by the Supreme Court \u2014 a step that Trump never took as he sought to disrupt the American tradition of peaceful transfers of power. The idea that the 2024 election may not be free and fair was also raised recently by Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance,\u00a0who is reported to be on Trump\u2019s shortlist as a potential vice presidential nominee. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier this month that \u201cI totally plan to accept the results of 2024,\u201d while holding out the possibility that the election may not be fair if Trump were to lose. \u201cI think that Donald Trump will be (the victor).\u00a0And if it\u2019s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results. And, again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president, been reelected president.\u201d Vance argued that parties in the election had to be willing to prosecute their cases if they believed there was election fraud. But academic studies and multiple legal cases have shown that fraud in presidential elections only occurs in isolated cases. That\u2019s not stopping Republicans demonstrating their loyalty to Trump by casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election before it even happens.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/republicans-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_giuliani-freeman-moss-agreement", "text": "Rudy Giuliani has agreed to never again publicly accuse two Georgia election workers of tampering with votes in the 2020 election, a false accusation that he has repeated frequently and\u00a0that\u00a0led to his bankruptcy. With the\u00a0agreement,\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0is\u00a0forfeiting a yearslong verbal and legal battle he\u2019s waged with the\u00a0election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss. It also gives the\u00a0women\u00a0significant power to hold him accountable if Giuliani again publicly suggests they stole votes to hurt\u00a0former President Donald\u00a0Trump, which is not true. A draft of the agreement filed in court Tuesday says Giuliani would be \u201cpermanently enjoined from publishing, causing others to publish, and/or assisting in others\u2019 publication of any statements that suggest that Plaintiffs, whether mentioned directly, indirectly, or by implication, engaged in wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election.\u201d Attorneys for Freeman and Moss say the agreement\u00a0would\u00a0allow them to take Giuliani to court immediately if he repeats potentially defamatory statements. \u201cToday ends his efforts to profit off of lies about these two heroes of American democracy,\u201d the workers\u2019 attorney Michael Gottlieb said in a statement. CNN has reached out to Giuliani\u2019s spokesperson for comment. The agreement was formalized in a Wednesday night court order, setting Giuliani up for potentially severe and swift consequences in court if he breaks it. False statements he previously made that he can no longer reiterate include his belief that Freeman and Moss tampered with ballots in 2020 and that video captured fake ballots for Joe Biden flooding the counting process in Fulton County. Freeman and Moss previously sued Giuliani for defamation and won a $148 million judgment against him, which the former mayor of New York has not begun to pay off. The trial provided a searing glimpse into the harassment election workers suffered while prominent Trump supporters spread lies about the 2020 election. Giuliani is separately facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona for his efforts for Trump four years ago, and he has been suspended from practicing law. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty in both cases, with his arraignment in Arizona taking place earlier Tuesday. Giuliani is also in Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy, with Freeman, Moss and others pursuing everything he has of value. The agreement includes Freeman and Moss dropping a second lawsuit they filed against Giuliani on the same day they won the $150 million judgment against him in December, because he continued to make false statements about them.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_elections-uk-mexico-what-matters", "text": "A large portion of Americans think the US government needs major, systemic reform \u2014 at least according to some polling \u2014 so it\u2019s worth looking at how other countries are doing things. Where are elections not never-ending? Anyone struggling to maintain interest in the never-ending, yearslong focus on the American presidential election might look with envy at the United Kingdom. Voters there only learned Wednesday they\u2019ll have an election in July, when rain-soaked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gambled by announcing a snap general election for July 4. No months of primaries. No party conventions. Everyone knew something was coming \u2014 Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party had until next January to call the election, and it seems like an excessive period since the last UK-wide election in December 2019 \u2014 but clearly the campaign portion will be truncated. Sunak and his party have six weeks to make up a steep deficit in the polls or at least hope to block an outright majority for the Labour Party. RELATED: 7 questions you might have about the UK\u2019s snap July general election British voters won\u2019t directly pick a prime minister. Instead, they\u2019ll select members of Parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority automatically becomes prime minister, and he or she assembles a government around them. It would be as if US House Speaker Mike Johnson appointed fellow lawmakers to run portions of the federal government. It can be a messy system, such as when the ruling Conservative Party churned through a series of prime ministers in recent years without having to get any input from voters. In contrast, India, which is the world\u2019s largest democracy and which, like the UK, has a parliamentary system of government, conducts its election over the course of many weeks. Results will be announced on June 4. CNN\u2019s Will Ripley was recently out on the campaign trail with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is vying for a third consecutive term. Modi\u2019s international reputation has morphed in those years from that of a reformer to that of a divisive nationalist, vilifying the country\u2019s Muslims in his bid to keep power. Where are they choosing between 2 younger women instead of 2 old men? Anyone struggling to find inspiration in the rematch of two senior citizens vying for the US presidency might look with some envy at Mexico, where the government bears many similarities to the US but where the president can only serve a single six-year term. That means Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador must step aside despite his relative popularity \u2014 and, at 70, youth \u2014 compared with the US options, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Instead of choosing between two older men, when Mexican voters go to the polls on June 2, they will be choosing between two younger women. L\u00f3pez Obrador endorsed the front-runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate from his Morena Party who previously led the Mexico City government. The candidate for an opposition coalition is Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, a former Mexican senator. Both are 61. There are other candidates, although they have little chance of winning. Tragedy struck the campaign trail Wednesday when a stage collapsed due to heavy winds, killing nine people. It\u2019s a direct election \u2014 no Electoral College \u2014 and the person who gets the most votes wins. Where do judges not have lifetime appointments? Another difference in Mexico is that Supreme Court justices serve a 15-year term instead of the justice-for-life tradition in the US. If the US had term limits, Samuel Alito would be three years off the bench and free to fly whatever flag he wanted at any of his homes. Instead, with no term limits and no binding ethics rules for US Supreme Court justices, there\u2019s nothing to keep Alito from joining opinions related to November\u2019s election. That\u2019s despite the fact that the flags outside his homes suggest he might have some preferences. Does an upside-down flag flown outside his home in Virginia days before \ufeffBiden\u2019s inauguration betray a bias? Does the flying of a flag seen at the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally suggest a friendliness to Christian nationalists? There\u2019s arguably more evidence of a preference in the activism of fellow justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni. Thomas, who was appointed to the bench in 1991 by then-President George H.W. Bush, is more than 30 years into his Supreme Court tenure. Both Thomas and Alito, in their 70s, are younger than both of the men most primary voters for the major political parties have selected to run for president. Where do they overhaul their court systems? If the nature of the US Supreme Court seems immutable and unchangeable, it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no political will to change the system, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. Congress could, in theory, impose term limits on justices. It could also change the number of justices on the court, as it has in the past. There are active campaigns to change the US system, including changing the number of justices and imposing 18-year term limits. But these do not currently have major political momentum. Plus, Republicans rightly feel they will enjoy an advantage with the current system for decades to come. It\u2019s unlikely they would buy into an overhaul. The UK actually overhauled its Supreme Court with a Constitutional Reform Act back in 2005, although a major difference between the UK and the US is that the UK does not technically have a written constitution. There are plenty of cautionary tales out there as well about other forms of government. In Russia and China, where free speech and the press are seriously limited, autocratic leaders have instilled themselves and are looking to widen their worldwide influence. El Salvador had a ban on its president serving two consecutive terms, but a court full of appointees by controversial President Nayib Bukele gave him the power to seek and win reelection in February. That\u2019s not an option in the US, where the 22nd Amendment only allows for a person to serve two four-year presidential terms. Whoever wins in November \u2014 Biden or Trump \u2014 will be unable to run again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/elections-uk-mexico-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_iranian-foreign-minister-ali-bagheri-kani", "text": "Within days of the helicopter crash that killed its president and other top officials, Iran detailed a succession plan and named replacements in a clear effort to project stability at a moment of profound and sudden uncertainty within the regime. One familiar name stood out to US officials: the new acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani. Seen\u00a0by US officials as a hardline establishment figure,\u00a0Kani\u00a0has\u00a0been a top negotiator for Iran on sensitive talks with the United States on everything from nuclear issues to its use of proxy forces to attack US and allied interests across the region. Just last week in Oman, Kani was part of a delegation of senior\u00a0Iranian\u00a0officials that met indirectly with US officials, current and former officials said. Because the US and Iran do not have formal diplomatic relations, the two delegations sat in separate rooms while Omani officials passed back and forth messages. Kani, US officials said, is a known quantity\u00a0and\u00a0one\u00a0example of\u00a0why the Biden administration largely expects little\u00a0to change in Iran\u00a0following the\u00a0sudden\u00a0deaths of its president and top officials. For hours on Sunday after the US received the first reports that a helicopter had crashed while carrying some of\u00a0Iran\u2019s\u00a0most senior\u00a0leaders, including President Ebrahim\u00a0Raisi, US officials weren\u2019t sure how bad the accident was. But even once it became clear that\u00a0Raisi\u00a0and the others aboard had\u00a0perished, the consensus view across the US government was that Iran\u2019s foreign and domestic policy were likely to remain consistent. That\u2019s because Iran\u2019s true leader is its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\u00a0Raisi\u00a0was, in many ways, a functionary. He had \u201cinfluence and impact,\u201d according to Jonathan\u00a0Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region, \u201cbut ultimate decision-making authority on every issue is solely held and consolidated by the Supreme Leader.\u201d Khamenei,\u00a085,\u00a0has been in frail health and has been watched closely. In the wake of the death of so many of his top officials, US officials believe that Khamenei will work to ensure that replacements adhere to his hardline worldview. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see there will be any major changes in the way Iran behaves on the world stage,\u201d a senior administration official said. If anything,\u00a0Panikoff\u00a0said, the death of\u00a0Raisi\u00a0and its other top leaders may make Iran more risk-averse in the short term. The senior administration official cautioned that it is still too soon to\u00a0know for sure how the crash might ultimately affect overall regional volatility, including\u00a0Iran\u2019s handling of the Gaza conflict. But for now, the Biden administration believes that there will be little impact. Impact on succession plan Raisi\u00a0was widely seen as a possible successor to Khamenei,\u00a0and his death has sparked a spirited debate in Washington intelligence and policy circles over how it will jumble the field. The Supreme Leader is chosen by an opaque group known as the Assembly of Experts. Some analysts believe that Khamenei\u2019s son may now have a better chance of succeeding his father, although he may lack critical religious credentials the role requires. But analysts say it\u2019s impossible to assess how that mysterious election process will play out and whether the crash has improved the chances of Khamenei\u2019s son. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably true if the Ayatollah dies in the next month,\u201d said\u00a0Panikoff. \u201cI think it may not be as true if it\u2019s still another two or three years and other people have surfaced and come into the system.\u201d Raisi\u2019s\u00a0death may also offer a small window for domestic protest. According to the Iranian constitution, elections must be held to name a new president within 50 days of\u00a0Raisi\u2019s\u00a0death. The Iranian regime has struggled with popular support;\u00a0Raisi\u00a0was known as \u201cthe butcher of Tehran\u201d and already a meme has circulated\u00a0within Iran\u00a0celebrating his death. Analysts say the regime will seek to tightly control who can run, deepening the public perception that elections are neither free nor fair. But Iranian authorities will almost certainly crack down on any nascent protests, analysts say. Parliamentary elections in March of this year had an historically low turnout rate \u2014\u00a0a signal of discontent with the regime and a worrying sign for regime leaders,\u00a0but not one most analysts believe will translate into meaningful or successful grassroots protest. Impact on proxy activity The sudden shakeup in Iran\u2019s leadership structure has taken place as Tehran has been deeply involved in the tense regional imbroglio surrounding Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. Iran has offered support to a series of proxies launching attacks on US and Israeli interests in the region and in April, it launched a large-scale missile and drone attack directly on Israel. US officials have long believed that Iran is seeking to calibrate its handling of the simmering, multiprong conflict, extracting costs from its adversaries but avoiding an all-out direct conflict with Israel or the United States. So far, it has been successful. A US military official said they have seen no uptick in proxy activity in the wake of the crash. Importantly, the military official said, the death of\u00a0Raisi\u00a0and the elevation of\u00a0Kani\u00a0to the role of foreign minister has also not opened any sudden opportunities for the United States when it comes to dealing with Iran. The same toxic issues \u2014\u00a0including Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014\u00a0remain intractable problems. In\u00a0talks with Iranian officials in\u00a0Oman last week, US officials once again laid out for their counterparts\u00a0the consequences of Iran\u2019s destabilizing actions, behavior and policies, according to the senior administration official and a US official. The Biden administration\u2019s view has been that having zero contact with Iran would heighten the risk of dangerous miscalculation,\u00a0officials told CNN, adding that the US will continue to deploy a mix of deterrence and diplomacy \u2013 like last week\u2019s talks \u2013 to manage Iran.\u00a0Issues like Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, it\u2019s various proxy groups and its nuclear program were all topics of discussion last week. The two sides have communicated in this\u00a0indirect\u00a0manner multiple times since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October. Last week was the first meeting of this kind in several months. But in the aftermath of the crash, Iran asked for US help in recovery efforts. The US, according to State Department spokesman Matt Miller, was unable to help \u201clargely for logistical reasons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/iranian-foreign-minister-ali-bagheri-kani/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial-defense-argument", "text": "Attorneys for Hunter Biden in a filing Thursday evening outlined some of the arguments they may bring in the upcoming gun trial in Delaware, including his state of mind when he purchased a firearm in 2018. Prosecutors have said they will present evidence \u2013 including text messages, pictures and excerpts from Hunter Biden\u2019s autobiography \u2013 to show that he was using illegal drugs around the time they say he purchased the firearm. The president\u2019s son faces three charges, including making false statements on a federal form and possessing a firearm while using illegal drugs. The trial is currently set for June 3. The filing from Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys Thursday highlights several issues they see with instructions for the jury proposed by prosecutors. One issue defense attorneys raised in the filing is whether Hunter Biden believed he was a drug user or addict at the time of purchasing and possessing the firearm. \u201cThe terms \u2018user\u2019 or \u2018addict\u2019 are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\u201d the defense attorneys wrote. \u201cSomeone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\u201d The filing also highlights several arguments surrounding the Second Amendment. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys say that a jury should be instructed that the statute he has been charged with \u201cis violated only when a person is simultaneously armed and actively intoxicated, and using the weapon in some way that terrifies or endangers others.\u201d \u201cAs there is no evidence that Mr. Biden never loaded or fired the weapon, displayed it publicly, or threatened anyone with it, and was not in actual possession of the firearm throughout the entire eleven days from the time of purchase to disposal, the Special Counsel cannot meet that burden,\u201d the defense attorneys wrote. His attorneys added that the jury instructions proposed by prosecutors \u201cviolate the Second Amendment\u201d and \u201cunlawfully expand the scope\u201d of the gun-control law being used against him in the case. They added: \u201cA gun owner who leaves their guns behind when they head to the bar for a drink or locks their gun in a lockbox or safe while using marijuana (or taking a legally prescribed Oxycontin) is being responsible and should not be treated like a felon. That is not just good policy, it is a constitutional right under the Second Amendment.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys previously filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that the primary statute under which he\u2019s charged violates his rights under the Second Amendment. The motion was rejected by the judge presiding over the case. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will meet Friday with the federal judge overseeing over the case, Maryellen Noreika, for the final conference before trial begins.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/hunter-biden-gun-trial-defense-argument/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_republican-senators-defend-alito-second-controversial-flag", "text": "Top Republican senators are defending Supreme\u00a0Court Justice Samuel Alito as the conservative justice became embroiled in a second flag controversy, even as some Democrats call for Alito to recuse himself from key matters pending before the high court. The flag \u2013 which was flown outside Alito\u2019s vacation home in New Jersey \u2013 is known as the \u201cAppeal to Heaven.\u201d Its history dates to the Revolutionary War, but it has become a symbol for supporters of former President Donald Trump and was on display during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Sen. John Cornyn, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and is vying to be the next Senate GOP leader, argued that the left is targeting Alito because of his positions. \u201cI just think Democrats are determined to harass members of the Supreme Court. I don\u2019t see them criticizing Sotomayor, Kagan, or others. So obviously, they don\u2019t like Justice Alito or the decisions he makes,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd this is just part of long-standing harassment of the courts, going back to when Clarence Thomas was \u2014 talked about a high-tech lynching during his confirmation process.\u201d He added, \u201cPeople who are judges on the Supreme Courts have personal lives, they have families, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily responsible for everything their families do or say.\u201d GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is also on the Judiciary Committee, agreed, saying that there were not the same accusations of political bias after liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor published her book. \u201cI\u2019m not going to address the particular issue, but the word \u2018political\u2019 comes up, and you brought it up. And I think it\u2019s appropriate for us to say that on the side of issues that come up with the Supreme Court, they seem to be coming up now, very frequently from the left, and it seems to me that those same issues were not raised. It was Sotomayor, as an example, on her book,\u201d he said. Grassley added that the Supreme Court has recently changed its ethics protocols, and that it can handle issues of recusal internally: \u201cThe Supreme Court has their new protocols, so we ought to wait and see how that works out.\u201d The revelation over the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag outside Alito\u2019s vacation home, which was reported by the New York Times, comes on the heels of earlier reporting from the Times that an\u00a0upside-down\u00a0American flag \u2013 a symbol\u00a0used by some supporters of Trump\u00a0who challenged the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory\u00a0\u2013 hung outside Alito\u2019s home after the election. Several prominent Republican senators criticized Alito over the upside-down flag. On Thursday, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis acknowledged that it was \u201cprobably not wise,\u201d for Alito to have the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag or the upside-down American flag outside his home. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a public figure, you do need to pay attention to what\u2019s out there. I\u2019m not gonna \u2014 I think it\u2019s overplayed in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that, you know, that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a public figure, whether you\u2019re in the judiciary or the US Senate.\u201d Tillis added that he also believes justices appointed by Democratic presidents do not receive the same scrutiny Alito faced.\u00a0\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be intellectually honest about it, let\u2019s take a look at every instance where there\u2019s a whiff of sort of a political or ideological motivation. And I \u2014 where do you want to start? Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Kagan, I mean, there\u2019s any number of instances where maybe they should have not waded into the political, but they do from time to time,\u201d he said. GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy accused the Times of bias over its reporting, noting that the American flag incident happened three years ago. \u201cWhat\u2019s the latest version? What\u2019s reasonable? I think that that would dictate how we go forward,\u201d he said. Cassidy also dismissed calls for Alito to recuse himself from the Trump immunity case, saying \u201cyes,\u201d he believes the justice can rule impartially. In contrast, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that Alito should \u201cabsolutely\u201d recuse himself. \u201cI think the question is how many MAGA battle flags does the Supreme Court justice have to fly until the rest of the court takes it seriously?\u201d he asked. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Thursday said Alito must recuse himself from any matter pending before the Supreme Court that has to do with the January 6 insurrection. \u201cIt is totally inappropriate,\u201d Jeffries said\u00a0of the news reports. \u201cIn the case of Samuel Alito, he definitively needs to recuse himself from any matter pending before the United States Supreme Court that has to do with the January 6 violent insurrection. He should have no part of it,\u201d he added. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark on Thursday also called on Alito to recuse himself from any cases that involve the January 6 attack, Trump and election integrity. \u201cThis is a threat to the rule of law and a serious breach of ethics, integrity, and Justice Alito\u2019s oath of office,\u201d Clark said in a statement. \u201cAt minimum, he must recuse himself from any cases involving January 6th, Donald Trump, and the security of our elections. Anything less will tarnish our judicial system and democracy,\u201d\u00a0Clark added. CNN\u2019s Haley Talbot and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_trump-senate-democrats-oil-investigation", "text": "Senate Democrats have launched an inquiry into recent reports that Donald Trump offered oil executives the reversal of some of President Joe Biden\u2019s climate policies upon the former president\u2019s reelection in exchange for campaign contributions. The chairs of the Senate Finance and Budget committees announced in a joint statement Thursday that they have sent letters to nine oil companies, including ExxonMobile and Chevron, asking for additional information related to a fundraiser event where Trump allegedly sought $1 billion in campaign contributions in return for promises of policy changes to benefit their companies. The committees are seeking \u201cdescriptions of policy proposals discussed\u201d and \u201cmaterials distributed to any attendees\u201d at the event. Last week, the House Oversight Committee made a similar request to those companies. \u201cTime and time again, both Mr. Trump and the U.S. oil and gas industry have proved they are willing to sell out Americans to pad their own pockets,\u201d\u00a0Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said in a statement. \u201cAnd now, emboldened by impunity, Mr. Trump and Big Oil are flaunting their indifference to U.S. citizens\u2019 economic well-being for all to see, conferring on how to trade campaign cash for policy changes.\u00a0Such potential abuses must be scrutinized.\u201d The congressional probe follows an exclusive report from The Washington Post earlier this month that detailed an April fundraiser event at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. There, sources with knowledge of the meeting told the Post, one executive expressed frustration with current environmental regulations and shared that he had spent $400 million to lobby the Biden administration. In response, Trump allegedly promised that in exchange for a $1 billion contribution to his reelection campaign, he would reverse some climate policies, including ending the Biden administration\u2019s pause on approvals\u00a0for several pending liquified natural gas export projects \u201cthe first day,\u201d according to the Post. The committees are seeking information on any donations made by the company since January 2023 to the Trump 2024 campaign or other political organization supporting his reelection efforts. The chairs have also demanded copies of any \u201cdraft executive orders\u201d or \u201cother policy-related documents that were created for the purpose of potential use in a possible Trump.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign slammed the investigation Thursday and sought to contrast the former president\u2019s climate platform with that of Biden, who it accused of being \u201ccontrolled by environmental extremists who are trying to implement the most radical energy agenda in history.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is supported by people who share his vision of American energy dominance to protect our national security and bring down the cost of living for all Americans,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CNN. In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration. The Biden administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump\u2019s actions and has enacted stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from\u00a0vehicles,\u00a0power plants\u00a0and the\u00a0oil and gas\u00a0industry. Trump has vowed that if he\u2019s reelected he will reverse those actions and boost fossil fuels, and oil and gas drilling.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trump-nazi-allusions-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump dabbles in Nazi allusions too often for it to be a coincidence. The latest example is a video posted on the ex-president\u2019s social media account that features a fake headline implying the US could become a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins a second term in November. The video replicates what appears to be World War I-era newspapers. But the term \u201cReich,\u201d which means a kind of empire, is also synonymous with the later Third Reich of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s campaign insisted the sharing of the third-party video on Monday was the work of a staffer and not Trump, who was in court. It was eventually taken down hours later on Tuesday. Trump may not have not been responsible for the post. But campaigns reflect the character of the candidate. And Trump has been flirting with Nazi imagery and giving comfort to far-right extremists for years. He recently accused President Joe Biden of running a \u201cGestapo\u201d administration. Trump has several times warned immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the United States, echoing language used by Hitler in his manifesto \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d which the ex-president claims he hasn\u2019t read. Back in 2017, Trump equivocated about condemning a White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which marchers chanted \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Trump also allegedly praised Hitler, according to former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was quoted by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto in his new book \u201cThe Return of Great Powers.\u201d Kelly commented: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, but Hitler did some good things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.\u2019\u201d Sciutto also cited Kelly as saying that Trump believed that Hitler\u2019s hold on senior Nazi officers displayed a loyalty he did not enjoy from his senior subordinates. When the book was published, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not comment on the substance of the allegations from Kelly and another former White House official, former national security advisor John Bolton. But he accused them both of \u201csuffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d In 2021, a Trump spokeswoman denied the former president had praised Hitler. Some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests an ignorance of history and his own self-obsession. But it must also be viewed in the context of a past and possibly future president who admires present day tyrants and dictators and has vowed to use the powers of the presidency to enact personal and political retribution. He\u2019s promising the biggest deportation operation in history to expel undocumented migrants. And his echoing of Nazi rhetoric on immigration has the same consequence as Hitler\u2019s \u2014 to demonize outsiders supposedly threatening the \u2018native\u2019 purity of the homeland. Trump has already tried to avoid leaving power after a democratic election he lost, whipping up his supporters ahead of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And over the weekend, he spitballed about potentially serving more than the two terms to which the Constitution says he can be elected.\u00a0Some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric seems designed to get a rise from his opponents and the media. But a strongman\u2019s aspirations lay behind it. And the searing demagoguery of his rallies increasingly resembles a tyrant\u2019s theatrics. Biden seized on the latest evidence of extremism in Trump\u2019s orbit by telling Democratic donors in Boston on Tuesday that \u201cthis is the same guy that uses Hitler\u2019s language, not America\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0He also used the furor to bolster his warnings that Trump\u2019s return to the White House would be a disaster for democracy. \u201cThe threat that Trump poses is greater in the second term than it was in the first.\u201d It\u2019s a good rule in politics that no one should use Nazi-themed rhetoric or allusions. Even Trump critics who portray him as an aspiring Nazi tyrant contribute to an erosion of the record about some of humanity\u2019s most heinous crimes. And as extreme as a second Trump term might be, the Nazi Germany comparison feels extreme. Analogies to the autocratic rule and democratic dismantling taking place under his friend, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, seem more on point. The casual proliferation of Nazi references is especially troubling at a moment when echoes of the 1930s are everywhere. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine recalls Hitler\u2019s European expansionism. Israel has just suffered the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, in the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. And there\u2019s been an upsurge of antisemitism in the United States. Anti-Jewish hate has infiltrated some pro-Palestinian protests initially motivated by anger over the civilian carnage of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Some of Trump\u2019s GOP allies have highlighted some antisemitic incidents on college campuses to distract from Trump\u2019s past use of antisemitic tropes, including his attacks on American Jews who vote Democrat and his implications they have dual loyalties to the US and Israel. The rising use of both Nazi innuendo and antisemitism suggest a troubling trend \u2014 the receding of the lessons of World War II and the Holocaust. The public\u2019s collective memory is fading as the Baby Boomers who grew up in the shadow of their parents\u2019 exploits in the 1940s Greatest Generation also begin to pass on. Anyone who admires Hitler and his murderous cult would do well to walk through the preserved death camps, gas chambers and mass crematoria in Eastern Europe where Nazis exterminated the continent\u2019s Jews. And those who carelessly peddle Nazi-themed rhetoric should visit the cliffs of Normandy, where Biden is expected next month to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day amid rows of buried US and Allied soldiers who perished as part of the cost of eradicating fascism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-nazi-allusions-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is presiding over the sprawling racketeering case, ruled in March that six charges in the 41-count indictment related to\u00a0Trump and\u00a0some\u00a0co-defendants\u00a0allegedly soliciting\u00a0the violation of oath by a public officer lacked the required detail about what underlying crime the defendants were soliciting. The move from Willis comes after an appeals court said it will consider whether she should be disqualified from prosecuting the case after McAfee said she could remain on the case. The appeals court decision gave the district attorney an opening to try to re-litigate other decisions by the lower court judge. Steve Sadow, an attorney for Trump in Georgia, called the filing \u201cnot unexpected.\u201d The former president was named in three of the dismissed counts, but McAfee\u2019s ruling left most of the indictment against Trump and his co-defendants in tact. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and he and his co-defendants are pushing for Willis to be disqualified from the case. The Georgia Court of Appeals said earlier this month that it would consider the challenge to McAfee\u2019s ruling, which allowed Willis to remain on the case if she removed the special prosecutor with whom she had engaged in a romantic relationship. The issues before the appeals court are likely to further delay any potential trial start and McAfee has not yet addressed when he might set a date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/fani-willis-appeal-dismissal-georgia-election-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story this week. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this week, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, and Democratic Rep. Katie Porter. The bill would require presidents and vice presidents to disclose their tax returns and any foreign payments made to them or their families in the two years prior to taking office, during their term in office and in the two years following. Presidents and vice presidents would also be required to disclose any conflicts of interest. It would require presidents and vice presidents to disclose any loans or loan repayments made to them by family members over $10,000 and report when immediate family members accompany the president or vice president on official travel. While Comer has spent much of his chairmanship scrutinizing President Joe Biden and Hunter Biden\u2019s finances and business dealings as part of an impeachment inquiry, Democrats have said similar scrutiny should apply to former President Donald Trump \u2013 who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2013 and his family. Trump has long been under scrutiny for not releasing his tax returns and Democrats have uncovered nearly $8 million in payments from other countries to Trump-owned businesses and properties while Trump was in office. It\u2019s not yet clear if House Republicans will bring the bill to the floor. The legislation represents a rare collaboration between two lawmakers on different sides of the political spectrum.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_mar-a-lago-documents-walt-nauta-donald-trump", "text": "Months before Donald Trump was indicted for mishandling classified documents, a federal judge said that investigators had \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the former president \u201cintended\u201d to hide classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago\u00a0resort, according to newly released court documents. Judge Beryl Howell cited, among other things, the discovery of additional\u00a0classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago months after the FBI\u2019s search of the property in the summer of 2022. The records included a\u00a0\u201cmostly empty\u201d folder marked as\u00a0\u201cClassified Evening Summary\u201d that was found in the former president\u2019s bedroom, as well as four other documents with classification markings found in his post-presidential office at the resort. \u201cNotably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Howell\u00a0wrote in March 2023. The ruling was among hundreds of pages of previously sealed filings that were publicly docketed Tuesday in the criminal classified documents case against Trump. Included as well were new images of Walt Nauta, Trump\u2019s personal aide, moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago room before the a Trump attorney was to review the boxes for classified materials sought by a subpoena. Prosecutors say\u00a0Nauta moved boxes around as part of an alleged conspiracy to conceal classified material from federal investigators. Nauta has been charged alongside Trump and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira in the case, facing charges of mishandling sensitive or classified materials and obstruction.\u00a0 All three have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. The photos of Nauta, which appear to be screenshots of surveillance footage, are dated June 1, 2022 \u2013 shortly before the Trump attorney was slated to canvass the storage room for any documents with classified markings to be returned to the federal government. The case against Trump, brought last summer, is currently in front of Judge Aileen Cannon in Fort Pierce, Florida. Cannon is a Trump appointee. Judge said that Trump used his attorney as a \u2018front man\u2019 to obstruct probe Trump\u2019s defense team is seeking to throw out parts of the prosecutors\u2019 case \u2013 including all the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and obtained from his former attorney Evan Corcoran, according to the filings in federal court in South Florida. Trump\u2019s team argues that the warrant for the search wasn\u2019t valid because of the way an FBI agent described the agency\u2019s thinking to a magistrate judge. They are also contesting Howell\u2019s 2023 ruling ordering\u00a0Corcoran to provide testimony and produce documents that he had previously withheld from the grand jury investigating the matter. Howell, an appointee of Barack Obama, said at the time that prosecutors had\u00a0\u201csufficient evidence to show that the former president\u201d used Corcoran as \u201ca \u2018front m[a]n\u2019 to obstruct the government\u2019s investigation and perpetuate the former president\u2019s unlawful retention of any classified documents contained in boxes transferred from the White House.\u201d Corcoran played a pivotal role in the investigation into the classified documents, as he was the attorney who was tasked with finding and producing documents with classified markings at Trump\u2019s Florida resort. In the criminal case filed last year, prosecutors say there was conspiracy led by Trump to move boxes of government records from the storage room before Corcoran searched for it for classified materials. Corcoran is referred to as \u201cPerson 18\u201d in Howell\u2019s ruling but can be identified based on what\u2019s known about the case. Among the topics Howell ordered Corcoran to testify about was a June 24, 2022, phone call he had with Trump \u2013 the same day investigators subpoenaed surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0She also ordered the production of 88 documents that had been withheld under attorney-client privilege. Howell\u00a0recounted Trump\u2019s actions over the course of several months while the federal government sought to retrieve the sensitive documents taken from the\u00a0White House. Trump \u201cdeliberately curtailed his staff\u2019s efforts to comply\u201d with the National Archives\u2019\u00a0initial efforts to retrieve the documents, she wrote. \u201cThe former president\u2019s misdirection of NARA was apparently a dress rehearsal for his actions in response to the May 11, 2022 subpoena,\u201d Howell said. Twenty-one of the 32 national security documents Trump is accused of criminally mishandling were in the former president\u2019s possession August 8, 2022, the date of the Mar-a-Lago FBI search. That means that Trump\u2019s team in this newly available motion to suppress is seeking to cut out from the case those 21 documents\u2013and thus their related charges\u2013and the hundreds of other classified records around them, plus the part of the case accusing Trump of obstruction of justice that is built around Corcoran. Guidelines for FBI\u2019s search at Mar-a-Lago unsealed Also unsealed Tuesday was a law enforcement document outlining how the FBI was authorized to search Mar-a-Lago. The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. Though the language is standard and directly from the department\u2019s manual, Trump quickly took to social media Tuesday to decry the 2022 document as having \u201cauthorized\u201d deadly force. \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\u201d Trump said in a\u00a0post on Truth Social. \u201cNOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d \u201cThe FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. Much of the plan includes traditional practices by the FBI when executing a warrant \u2013 like how agents are required to have their standard issued weapon, ammunition and credentials while on duty. Other parts, however, show the lengths that the bureau went to to accommodate the former president, including instructions for commanding agents to wear \u201cunmarked polo or collared shirts\u201d and to keep their \u201claw enforcement equipment concealed,\u201d as well as references to their efforts to coordinate with US Secret Service to create a smooth process for entering the Florida club.

Rick Scott\u00a0announced\u00a0his bid to be the next Senate GOP leader on Wednesday, putting him in a three-way secret ballot race that will be decided after the November elections. Scott has been a longtime supporter of former President Donald Trump and has maintained an icy relationship with GOP leadership in the Senate, including with outgoing Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, whose leadership position he is again gunning for after losing a long-shot bid to replace the Kentucky Republican in 2022. Scott, a first-term senator, would be considered an underdog in the race, which includes GOP Sens. John Thune, the minority whip, and John Cornyn, a former whip. The two other men have for months jockeyed to tip the scales in a race with no clear front-runner as their colleagues in the Senate weigh the candidates\u2019 fundraising abilities, leadership styles and their relationships with Trump \u2014 though the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has yet to endorse a replacement for McConnell, who has said he will step down as GOP leader in November. On Wednesday night, Scott told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he had spoken to Trump earlier in the day about the need for change in the chamber, adding that the former president was \u201cexcited I\u2019m\u00a0getting into the race.\u201d \u201cI am a change agent.\u00a0I was a change agent in\u00a0business.\u00a0I did turn arounds.\u00a0I changed Florida,\u201d Scott said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the\u00a0Senate.\u00a0We\u2019re going to be the Senate\u00a0that helps Donald Trump get his\u00a0conservative agenda done.\u201d Scott has long been a close Trump ally and quickly endorsed the former president over his home-state governor, Ron DeSantis, for president last year. He was one of several Republican senators who objected to the certification of 2020 election results and has been a constant defender of Trump in the face of his legal troubles. A former CEO of an embattled health care company, Scott has used his wealth to help fund his campaigns, serving two terms as the governor of Florida before his election to the Senate in 2018. He\u2019s facing reelection this year in a red-trending state that Democrats hope to put in play. Scott, then the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, became a pariah to some in his own party in 2022, when he released a proposal that would have sunset all federal programs in five years unless Congress extended them. Even McConnell quickly disavowed the plan, while Democrats pounced on it as a way to accuse Republicans of attempting to undercut popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. Months later, Scott walked back major sections of that plan to shield many of those popular programs \u2014 like Social Security and Medicare \u2014 from being sunset. Though, Democrats looking to turn his Senate seat blue in 2024 have continued to hit Scott on that unpopular proposal. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_nikki-haley-donald-trump", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley plans to vote for Donald Trump, she said Wednesday in her first public remarks since exiting the Republican presidential primary more than two months ago. Haley said Trump \u201chas not been perfect\u201d on policies important to her, including foreign policy, immigration and the economy, but President Joe Biden \u201chas been a catastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under the former president. Haley\u2019s remarks about the 2024 race came during a Q&A session following a speech at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, where she now serves as the Walter P. Stern chair. Haley said she has \u201cno regrets\u201d about her GOP primary bid: \u201cWe left it all on the field.\u201d She also thanked the primary voters who have continued to back her even after her departure from the race \u2014 a potential warning sign for Trump. And she reiterated the call she\u2019d made when exiting the race in March for the former president to reach out to those voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d Haley said. Earlier this year, Haley and Trump were engaged in what had become a bitter primary feud.  Haley, at one point, questioned the former president\u2019s mental fitness. She told CNN in January that Trump and Biden were \u201cequally bad.\u201d Her critiques of Trump during the primary grew even sharper after the former president mocked the absence of her deployed husband and called for all of her donors to be \u201cpermanently barred from the MAGA camp.\u201d \u201cIn that moment, he showed that with that kind of disrespect for the military, he\u2019s not qualified to be the president of the United States, because I don\u2019t trust him to protect them,\u201d Haley said in February. Then, days before dropping out, she said she no longer believed she was bound by the Republican National Committee pledge to support the party\u2019s eventual presidential nominee. \u2018Dangerous worldview\u2019 As she ventured back onto the political stage Wednesday, after two months out of public view, Haley didn\u2019t mention Trump in her Hudson Institute speech \u2014 only addressing the former president when asked about him afterward. \u201cA dangerous worldview has risen on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said in her remarks. \u201cOnce again, it threatens our prosperity and security. We need to take this seriously.\u201d She offered full support for Israel\u2019s war with Hamas and strongly criticized Biden for placing conditions on military aid to the country. \u201cBiden thinks he\u2019s stopping a war,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s dragging out a war, emboldening terrorists and making other wars more likely.\u201d She was also critical of her fellow Republicans, urging the party to support military aid for Ukraine and Israel. But she did not criticize GOP members by name and praised House Speaker Mike Johnson for the recent passage of a military aid package. \u201cSending weapons to Ukraine and Israel isn\u2019t foreign aid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an investment in a world in which authoritarian dictators cannot run roughshod over free countries.\u201d Since leaving the race in March, the former South Carolina governor has spent time reconnecting with her family, aides say, including her husband, Michael, who returned from a yearlong overseas deployment. Yet even in her absence, she\u2019s been winning votes in one Republican primary after another. Her lingering support has exposed a potential challenge Trump faces to unifty the party in suburban areas of swing states \u2013 such as outside Philadelphia, where Haley received nearly 25% of the vote in both Chester and Montgomery counties. While Trump has not extended an olive branch to Haley or her supporters, the Biden campaign has closely studied the Republican primary results, aides say, even in deep-red states such as Indiana, where Haley received about 22% of the vote earlier this month. The Biden campaign has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. \u201cThe campaign has the opportunity to target and engage high-information Republican voters like Nikki Haley supporters or other voters who voted for Donald Trump in \u201920, but voted for Democratic candidates in \u201822 across battleground states,\u201d a top Biden adviser told CNN. The Biden campaign argued Wednesday that Haley\u2019s backing of Trump doesn\u2019t change the choice before voters. \u201cNothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people \u2013 while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. \u201cOnly one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support \u2013 and that\u2019s President Biden\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s an open question how many of those voters backing Haley in primary contests are lodging a temporary protest against Trump or actually open to supporting Biden. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed Haley in the primary before switching his support to Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket. \u201cFor Nikki Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President Trump and also to Nikki Haley.\u201d Norman said that while Haley has not expressed interest in joining Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would be interested. \u201cPolitics is an interesting game. People can forget the past and look forward to the future,\u201d Norman said. For his part, Trump has said Haley \u201cis not under consideration\u201d but said he wished her well. As other former Republican contenders have fallen in line behind Trump, Haley has intentionally kept her distance \u2013 not hostile, but also not hungry for his adulation. The two have not spoken since her concession speech in March. One longtime Haley friend told CNN that Trump \u201cknows how to reach her if he wants to make amends and try to start winning over her supporters.\u201d Haley\u2019s next steps are uncertain. She has neither ruled in \u2013 nor ruled out \u2013 a potential 2028 presidential bid. In her speech Wednesday, she offered few clues, even as she struck an optimistic note to the future. \u201cWe are blessed to live in America,\u201d Haley said. \u201cAnd as every generation of Americans proves, we always rally to defend that blessing.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_senators-trudeau-letter-defense-spending", "text": "A bipartisan group of\u00a023\u00a0US senators\u00a0have written\u00a0to Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0urging\u00a0his country\u00a0to live up to its commitment\u00a0to spend 2% of GDP on defense amid\u00a0concerns\u00a0that key members of the NATO alliance are not pulling their weight. \u201cAs we approach the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., we are concerned and profoundly disappointed that Canada\u2019s most recent projection indicated that it will not reach its two percent commitment this decade,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cIn 2029, Canada\u2019s defense spending is estimated to rise to just 1.7 percent, five years after the agreed upon deadline of 2024 and still below the spending baseline.\u201d The rare letter from lawmakers to a head of state comes about two months before NATO\u2019s next annual summit in Washington, DC, which will mark the alliance\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary\u00a0as Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine continues. At last year\u2019s leader-level summit, the allies agreed that each member nation should spend at least\u00a02% of its GDP on defense. The senators pointed to that agreement in making their case for Canada to live up to the commitment. And the senators\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Republicans Mitt Romney of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas as well as Democrats Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, among others \u2014\u00a0argued that if Canada falls short of its commitment, it will hurt\u00a0NATO. \u201cCanada will fail to meet its obligations to the Alliance, to the detriment of all NATO Allies and the free world, without immediate and meaningful action to increase defense spending,\u201d the senators\u00a0wrote. Canada is a founding member of the defensive alliance, which now has 32 member nations. The senators noted the contributions Canada has made to\u00a0NATO on multiple fronts, including taking a leading role in support of\u00a0its military operations and developing standards around democracy, economic resilience and human rights. But the senators also pointed out that many other nations are taking the necessary steps to hit and exceed\u00a0the 2% target. \u201cBy the end of 2024, 18 NATO countries will meet the Alliance\u2019s goal to ensure NATO\u2019s continued military readiness. This is a historic investment in our collective security, led by NATO Allies like Poland, a country that has already exceeded three percent of its GDP for defense spending,\u201d they wrote. Earlier this year,\u00a0NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that he expects Canada to \u201cdeliver on the pledge\u201d or else details plans for reaching the target spending. More than a dozen\u00a0other NATO members \u2014 including Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands \u2014have also so far fallen short of the alliance\u2019s target. But the senators chose to write to Trudeau because\u00a0they believe Canada \u2014\u00a0unlike other nations\u00a0\u2014  does not appear to have a plan in place to hit the target, a congressional aide explained. While the letter does not mention former President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump, the\u00a0presumptive\u00a0GOP presidential nominee has had a real impact on the ongoing efforts to get alliance members to spend\u00a0more. During his presidency Trump\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0pressed\u00a0members to contribute more to the alliance,\u00a0and to spend more on defense spending overall. Europeans are also concerned about what Trump might do in a possible second term when it comes to NATO. If he wins the election in November, Trump\u00a0will consider pushing for a two-tier NATO, CNN\u00a0has previously reported.\u00a0That would mean countries that\u00a0don\u2019t meet the\u00a02% of\u00a0GDP\u00a0spending\u00a0commitment would not be protected by NATO\u2019s Article 5, which guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation if it\u2019s attacked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/senators-trudeau-letter-defense-spending/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_bill-burns-europe-visit-gaza-negotiations", "text": "CIA Director Bill Burns is traveling back to Europe to try to get the talks on a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas that would halt the war in Gaza back on track, a US official told CNN. \u201cThe Director is traveling to Europe in the coming days in an effort to revive the talks,\u201d the US official said. \u201cThe director is in frequent discussions with the Egyptians, Qataris and Israelis. Both Egypt and Qatar are very engaged, as are the Israelis.\u201d The latest round of talks comes as the war in Gaza has reached its seventh month, leaving more than 35,000 people dead and thousands of Palestinians in desperate need of food, water and medical aid. The last temporary truce, in November, saw the release of more than 100 hostages, but the Israel Defense Forces estimate that there are still around 130 people being held. Burns has acted as a key interlocutor for the United States in the multiparty talks between Israel, Hamas, Egypt and Qatar, and he has been dispatched during previous rounds of talks, only to see them later collapse. A Qatari official told CNN that Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani will also take part. The prime minister is currently in Paris, the official said. Neither official would confirm the other participants. In the past they have been joined in Paris by Israel\u2019s Mossad Director David Barnea and the head of Egyptian intelligence Abbas Kamel. The talks were paused three weeks ago after Burns crisscrossed the region trying to close the remaining gaps between Israel and Hamas. CNN\u00a0reported Tuesday\u00a0that Egypt muddied the negotiations after independently changing the terms of a framework that Israel had signed on to and presenting it to Hamas who then declared they accepted it. The\u00a0ceasefire agreement\u00a0that Hamas\u00a0ended up\u00a0announcing\u00a0on May 6 was not what the Qataris or the Americans believed had been submitted to Hamas for\u00a0a potential final review, three sources told CNN. The proposal had been changed without the knowledge of Israel or the other mediators, the US and Qatar, prompting anger and frustration. Burns was in the region when word reached him that the Egyptians had changed the terms of the deal. Two days after Hamas\u2019 response on May 6, Burns returned to Washington and sources told CNN the talks were \u201cpaused.\u201d The Qataris are expected to play a bigger role in this round, a source previously told CNN, but Egypt is still expected to be central given their essential proximity to Hamas, as well as Israel\u2019s preference of Egypt to Qatar. The discussions would still be expected to center\u00a0on\u00a0a broad framework that would include an initial stage in which up to 33 Israeli hostages would be released over at least six weeks. Hamas has been pushing to include the bodies of dead hostages in the initial release and also have the first phase flow into a second with no break \u2014\u00a0both positions that Israel has resisted.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_marines-osprey-crash-boeing-rolls-royce-bell-textron-lawsuit", "text": "The families of four US Marines killed in a 2022 crash of an Osprey aircraft are suing Boeing, Bell Textron Inc. and Rolls Royce, alleging that the companies failed to address known issues with the aircraft that resulted in the crash. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday, focuses on a MV-22B Osprey crash in June 2022, when five Marines stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, California, were killed while conducting a training mission. A Marine Corps investigation determined last July that the accident was caused by a mechanical failure and that there \u201cwas no error on the part of the pilots and aircrew and nothing they could have done to anticipate or prevent this mishap.\u201d \u201cThey were conducting routine flight operations in accordance with applicable regulations when this catastrophic and unanticipated mechanical failure occurred,\u201d the Marine Corps\u00a0said in 2023. The five Marines killed were Capts. Nicholas Losapio and John Sax;, Cpls. Nathan Carlson and Seth Rasmuson; and Lance Cpl. Evan Strickland. The lawsuit, filed by the families of Sax, Carlson, Strickland and Rasmuson, accuses Boeing, Bell Textron, Rolls Royce Corps and Rolls Royce North America of negligence, negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, and the failure to warn. Tim Loranger, the lawyer representing the families in the lawsuit, told CNN on Thursday that ultimately the lawsuit alleges that the aircraft\u00a0the Marines were on was known to have a defect but \u201cinsufficient steps have been taken to correct it.\u201d \u201cWe allege they had information they didn\u2019t disclose,\u201d Loranger said. \u201cAnd here we are today as a result.\u201d The mechanical failure in June 2023 involved the dual hard clutch engagement, which the Marine Corps said \u201ccreated a Single Engine and Interconnect Drive System (Single Engine/IDS) failure.\u201d The failure ultimately resulted in an \u201cunrecoverable departure from controlled flight, resulting in the tragic crash.\u201d \u201cDue to their defective products, breaches of contracts, breaches of warranties, wrongful actions and omissions, the defendants named herein caused the accident and the tragic deaths of Plaintiffs\u2019 decedents, five fine young United States Marines,\u201d the lawsuit says. Boeing, Bell Textron and Rolls Royce have not yet responded to request for comment from CNN.\u00a0The lawsuit comes as Boeing has been under scrutiny and is expected to present a plan to fix quality issues on its assembly line next week, after a hole blew open on the side of a Boeing 737 Max mid-flight in January. The lawsuit comes months after another deadly V-22 Osprey crash off the coast of Japan, which resulted in the deaths of eight US Special Operations airmen. The US military\u00a0grounded\u00a0its entire fleet of V-22 Ospreys in December as a result. That grounding guidance\u00a0was lifted\u00a0in March this year; officials said at the time an investigation identified a \u201cmateriel failure\u201d responsible for the crash. Col. Brian Taylor, the program manager of the Naval Air Systems Command V-22 joint program office, told reporters in March that the crash resulted from an \u201cunprecedented\u201d component failure, though he declined to say what component specifically failed or how. The deadly crash near Japan had been the latest in a string of Osprey incidents. In August 2023,\u00a0three US Marines were killed\u00a0when a MV-22B Osprey crashed during military exercises in Australia. And in March 2022, just months before the five US Marines were killed in California, four US service members died in a MV-22 crash during a NATO exercise. Loranger told CNN that it\u2019s unclear whether there is a common thread between the June 2023 crash and the other recent incidents but said the point for the families in the lawsuit is to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened, why did this aircraft crash, why have other Ospreys crashed, and what has been done to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s making sure when families send their Marines or airmen off to do their job, that they aren\u2019t going to get the knock on their door because something broke in the (aircraft),\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/marines-osprey-crash-boeing-rolls-royce-bell-textron-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_trump-trial-jury-analysis", "text": "It was a tawdry tale of lies, revenge and hush money, with a sordid alleged bedroom scene, a judge whose patience finally cracked and a raging defendant who is a once and possibly future president. But there\u2019ll be no more evidence, witnesses, or brutal cross-examinations in Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial, which has moved into the final phase before jurors retire to deliberate their verdict in a historic case entangled with the 2024 election. Unusually, there will now be a break of a week \u2014 because of the Memorial Day holiday \u2014 between Tuesday\u2019s final testimony and when lawyers for each side lay out their final narratives in closing summations. Then the judge will deliver his instructions \u2014 a critical stage of the case in which the jury will learn how to apply the law and to weigh conflicting testimony and different kinds of evidence. That\u2019s when seven men and five women from New York will have to decide whether Trump will be the first ex-president convicted of a crime and the first presumptive nominee running as a convicted felon. The former president has been preparing for the moment for weeks. He\u2019s mounted a daily campaign to destroy the reputation of the court and Judge Juan Merchan, as well as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, who brought the case. \u201cThe judge hates Donald Trump, just take a look, take a look at him, take a look at where he comes from. He can\u2019t stand Donald Trump,\u201d the former president said on Tuesday in the latest of his daily media rants in the corridor. At one point, the judge threatened to send him to jail if he continued to violate a gag order protecting key witnesses \u2013 establishing a red line that the ex-president is yet to cross. Trump\u2019s bizarre practice of reading aloud critiques of the case from his allies in conservative media was all designed to create an atmosphere of grievance around the trial, which he\u2019s leveraged to bolster the core rationale of his White House campaign \u2014 that he\u2019s a persecuted victim of weaponized justice. As the weeks went on, Trump was joined at the court by a cadre of Republican lawmakers, exemplifying his total control over the GOP after winning his third consecutive nomination and its continued genuflection toward a leader who tried to destroy American democracy to stay in power after the 2020 election. It\u2019s still early to say if the case in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty \u2014 and the eventual verdict \u2014 will have any influence on voters this fall. But there is little sense the trial, from which television cameras are barred, has captured the imagination of the nation. The intricate task that awaits jurors It\u2019s impossible to know how jurors are interpreting the daily drama of the courtroom in any trial. But there\u2019s a lot to sort out in a case that has grave implications for Trump\u2019s future, and even his liberty, and comes with huge political overtones as potentially the only one of his four criminal trials to be completed before the election. In a month of dramatic testimony, the prosecution alleged that Trump illegally falsified business records to cover up a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to deceive voters in 2016 in an example of election interference. Trump has denied the alleged affair with Daniels, and hush money payments are not illegal in themselves. But the jury must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York State prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records \u2014 which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime \u2014 in relation to the election. \u201cThe defendant Donald Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,\u201d prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement in April. The defense, however, contends that Trump is innocent of any crime. His lawyers have sought to cast doubt on the paper trail established by prosecutors by saying Trump had nothing to do with falsifying financial records and they\u2019ve tried to obliterate the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s star witness, Michael Cohen. The ex-president\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d is critical to the case because he provided the only direct implication of Trump in an alleged scheme to break the law with the cover up of the payment. And the defense tried to establish that Trump did not try to suppress details of his alleged affair with Daniels as part of a scheme to mislead voters. Rather, they argued, he was worried that it would upset his family. And in his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors: \u201cI have a spoiler alert. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election: It\u2019s called democracy.\u201d The critical witness Cohen\u2019s testimony will likely be a critical element of the deliberations \u2014 especially whether the damage done to his trustworthiness during a searing cross-examination is enough to convince one or more jurors they cannot convict Trump based on his former fixer\u2019s word. Prosecutors knew that they had a problem with Cohen heading into the trial since he had already gone to jail after being found guilty over offenses related to the hush money payment and other crimes, including lying to Congress. They therefore sought to buttress his testimony before he took the stand with days of evidence. They called David Pecker, the former head of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Pecker was not directly involved in the hush money payment at the center of the case. But he was used to establish that Cohen and Trump had a record of using payments to squash unflattering stories about the future president before the 2016 election. Former White House communications director and long-time Trump aide Hope Hicks was also called by the prosecution and appeared to put her former boss in a heap of trouble when she said that his campaign was transfixed with worry over the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that showed him boasting that he could grab women by the genitals. Hicks testified that Trump believed that the Daniels story would be even more damaging. \u201cIt would be better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\u201d Hicks said of his thinking. Why the most salacious evidence may have been \u2018best left unsaid\u2019 In the most risqu\u00e9 chapter of the trial, Daniels was called to testify about her alleged liaison with Trump in a suite in Lake Tahoe in 2006. Daniels said that she \u201cspanked\u201d Trump \u201cright on the butt\u201d with a magazine and returned from the bathroom to find him on the bed in his boxers and a T-shirt. She said that they had sex and that she was shaking when she left the room, which she remembered for its black-and-white-tiled floor. The judge had sought to limit the details of the encounter ahead of time, and after the testimony he commented that some of the explicit details were \u201cbest left unsaid.\u201d But the Daniels testimony was critical to the prosecution case because it illustrated the alleged liaison that it wants jurors to believe was the genesis of the cover up. When Cohen finally took the stand, he directly implicated Trump in the alleged scheme to buy Daniels\u2019 silence.\u00a0\u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, smart people, and \u2018That it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re a billionaire, just pay it. There\u2019s no reason to keep this thing out there so do it.\u2019 He expressed to me, \u2018Just do it,\u2019\u201d Cohen said, paraphrasing Trump\u2019s alleged instructions to him. The former fixer, who once said he\u2019d take a bullet for Trump, also denied that he had acted alone, saying that everything he did for his former boss required Trump\u2019s sign off \u2014 and that he wanted to make sure he was paid back. But Cohen\u2019s reputation came back to haunt him in a cross-examination when the defense claimed he was a liar who was obsessed with bringing Trump down and that he was getting rich from his media appearances and podcasts focusing on his former idol. The key moment came when Cohen was tripped up over a phone call about which he\u2019d previously testified under oath. He said he had discussed with Trump the payment of the hush money in that October 2016 call. But the defense produced texts Cohen sent before the call \u2014 placed to the phone of Trump\u2019s bodyguard, who was with the then-2016 GOP nominee \u2014 that suggested the subject of the 96-second conversation was another matter. In response, prosecutors used their redirect examination to try to downplay the importance of a single call, and Cohen said he spoke to Trump about the payment multiple times, not just on that occasion. But Trump\u2019s lawyers beseeched the judge on Monday to throw out the trial based on Cohen\u2019s testimony, saying the jury should not be asked to deliver a verdict based on what the defense viewed as unsafe evidence. \u201cThere is no way that the Court should let this case go to the jury, relying on Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony,\u201d Blanche told Merchan. In comparison to the weeks of testimony put on by the prosecution, the defense case lasted only 90 minutes and included only two witnesses before Trump\u2019s lawyers rested on Tuesday. That meant the former president, who many experts thought would pose a massive risk to his own case if he testified, did not take the stand. Some experts questioned whether the defense would also have been better not to have called one of its witnesses \u2014\u00a0Robert Costello, who got into a verbal altercation with an infuriated Merchan, some of which was seen by the jury. In an extraordinary scene, Merchan asked whether Costello was trying to stare him down after the witness had registered contempt for several of the judge\u2019s interventions. Costello was meant to rebut a claim by prosecutors that Trump mounted a pressure campaign to keep Cohen quiet in 2018. But he may have ended up creating a hole in the Trump defense, according to several legal experts. At the very least, his spell on the stand may have made a case that looked in recent days like it could turn on the reputation of Cohen once again focus on the behavior and character of the ex-president. It may have all been a sideshow that will have little bearing on the eventual destiny of the trial. But only the jury can decide that.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/trump-trial-jury-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Ted Cruz refused on Wednesday to say whether he will unconditionally accept the results of the 2024 election, the latest in a series of comments by prominent Republicans that seek to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the upcoming presidential contest. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually a ridiculous question,\u201d replied Cruz when asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source\u201d whether he will accept the results of the 2024 election regardless of who wins. \u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim. Like, we have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz, who objected to Arizona\u2019s election results on January 6, 2021, then went on in his interview with Collins to suggest, baselessly, that the 2020 election was rife with fraud. \u201cSo my question for you again, free and fair election, will you accept the results regardless of who wins?\u201d Collins asked. \u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz responded. Many prominent Republicans, starting with the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, are already casting doubt on the results in November. Trump said earlier this month that\u00a0he would only accept\u00a0the 2024 election results\u00a0\u201cif everything\u2019s honest.\u201d Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Sen. J.D.

Tim Scott has\u00a0refused to say\u00a0whether he would have certified the results as vice president. Cruz also defended conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who has been scrutinized over conspicuous flag displays at two of his homes in recent years, telling Collins, \u201cthis entire\u00a0hoopla is greatly overstated.\u201d \u201cI think there is a concerted effort that is driven by Democrats in the Senate to try to delegitimize the court and to try to demonize. We\u2019re seeing it with Justice Clarence Thomas. We\u2019re seeing it with Justice Sam\u00a0Alito. I think the whole thing is disgraceful,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz reiterated Alito\u2019s explanation that Alito\u2019s wife hoisted the symbol of discontent in response to profane signs in the neighborhood, including a neighbor posting a sign saying\u00a0\u201cF**k\u00a0Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Martha-Ann Alito. \u201cListen, there are justices I disagree with, and yet, you should treat everyone with civility and respect, and what Justice Alito said is, his wife was upset,\u201d Cruz said.

They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "The political calculation has changed again for Nikki Haley. Not long ago, the former South Carolina governor was arguing that Donald Trump was too old, too chaotic, too \u201cunhinged\u201d and too prone to temper tantrums to be president again and said he couldn\u2019t beat President Joe Biden. \u201cI feel no need to kiss the ring,\u201d Haley said in February before suspending her primary campaign.\u00a0\u201cMy political future is of no concern.\u201d But on Wednesday, she delivered the implicit endorsement everyone knew was coming sooner or later. Haley said that while Trump had not been \u201cperfect\u201d on issues that matter to her, like foreign policy and the national debt, Biden had been a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo, I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said the former US ambassador to the United Nations, who served in the ex-president\u2019s Cabinet. After a friendly photo-op in front of the Oval Office fireplace, she left that job in 2018 before she could be tarnished by association with Trump\u2019s mayhem. As 2024 loomed on the calendar, Haley said she would not run for president against her old boss \u2014 then did so anyway \u2014 to Trump\u2019s lingering fury. Before losing her home state\u2019s primary to Trump earlier this year, Haley lashed out at Republicans who backed Trump despite privately despairing over him. \u201cIn politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. \u2026 Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he\u2019s been and will continue to be for our party. They\u2019re just too afraid to say it out loud.\u201d Now Haley is saying out loud she\u2019s voting for Trump. But she had little choice but to join the herd if she wants a future in a party dominated by its presumptive nominee. It\u2019s the same decision reached by Ted Cruz, whose wife was once publicly humiliated by Trump but who has long since attached himself to the former president. On Wednesday night, the Harvard Law School graduate, who presently represents Texas in the US Senate, refused an invitation by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins to unconditionally accept the forthcoming results of the 2024 election. \u201cLook, if the Democrats win, I will accept the result. But I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d said Cruz, who then, in true Trump fashion, cited baseless claims that the 2020 contest was rife with fraud. There\u2019s not much of a path in the alternative: former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a onetime rising GOP star, became an example of what happens to conservative foreign policy hawks who refuse to temper warnings that Trump is a danger to democracy. Haley seeks to preserve her future There is every sign that Haley wants to run again for president once Trump finally leaves the stage. So repudiating him now would serve no personal political purpose except to end her career on a point of principle. History might applaud her selflessness, but power would likely remain out of her reach. Haley\u2019s move will reinforce an impression that she always adopts the political course most advantageous to her ambitions. But if Biden wins in November, she can say she predicted Trump would lose. If a Trump second term is a disaster, she\u2019s on the record predicting chaos. She could then be positioned to try to lead the GOP back to the pre-Trump positions on foreign policy and the economy that seem closest to her own beliefs, even if she often seemed in 2024 to be auditioning for the leadership of a party that doesn\u2019t exist in any recognizable form. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who has said that Trump should not be let anywhere near the White House again, said he was disappointed by Haley\u2019s decision. \u201cI think she has obviously made a political calculation that it is in her interests to support Donald Trump,\u201d Bolton told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Wednesday. Haley \u2013 who won Vermont and Washington, DC \u2013 is not the only younger GOP presidential candidate with still-burning White House dreams to undergo such a transformation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out at Trump when his own campaign faded in frigid Iowa in January, then endorsed him on the way out of the race far more quickly than Haley did. During her campaign, Haley argued that both Biden, who is 81, and Trump who turns 78 next month, were both too old to be president and called for cognitive tests for candidates over 75. But her decision to focus only on Biden\u2019s liabilities on Wednesday raises the questions of whether her voters will follow her in Trump\u2019s direction. Since she suspended her campaign, tens of thousands of voters in GOP primaries have continued to vote for her. This support is a living legacy of a campaign in which she set herself up as a vessel for Republicans who disdain Trump and wanted another candidate. Haley was especially strong in suburban areas where the ex-president struggles most. And the Biden campaign signaled that it would compete for this bloc of wavering GOP voters in November. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a place for Haley voters in my campaign,\u201d the president said during a fundraiser in the swing state of Georgia over the weekend. However, many Haley voters confided at events in New Hampshire and Iowa earlier this year that though they preferred her, they\u2019d probably stick with their party as loyal Republicans if Trump beat her to the nomination. In that sense, Haley\u2019s decision \u2013 while dripping with political expedience \u2013 may be one that many of her supporters are also wrestling with. The choice for Republicans who dislike Trump and are considering Biden is a more complex question in this election than the previous one. Now, Biden is the incumbent with a list of achievements and policies that directly contradict the core beliefs of many Republicans, including on foreign policy and economics. Memories of the chaos of the Trump administration have also diminished. Traditional national security Republicans may also perceive global war and chaos and Biden\u2019s growing feud with a right-wing Israeli prime minister as a reason not to switch their vote. \u201cA lot of Republicans are making the same calculation because the performance of the Biden administration has been so appalling,\u201d Bolton said. Political ambition behind Haley\u2019s choice Haley said she\u2019d vote for Trump while speaking at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, during her first major political speech since suspending her Republican presidential campaign. Her announcement during a Q&A seemed illogical. She had just delivered a hardline speech melding Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cold War hawkishness with the neoconservative notes of the Bush administration yet was promising to vote for an ex-president who has eviscerated both GOP foreign policy codes with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy. Haley argued that she wanted to vote for a candidate who would have \u201cthe backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account and who would secure the border.\u201d But during his first term, Trump often cozied up to US enemies like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un and spent four years berating US allies in Europe and Asia for freeloading off the United States. Biden, by contrast, has reinvigorated and expanded US alliances, especially NATO, which Trump despises. The Western alliance now has more direction than at any time since the end of the Cold War. And Trump might talk a good game on immigration, but he recently derailed the most conservative border bill in decades, apparently because he wanted to deprive Biden of an election-year win and preserve his narrative of a nation under siege. The tepid nature of Haley\u2019s support for Trump leaves some questions, including whether she will agree to campaign for him and whether she\u2019ll urge her voters to back him. While saying she\u2019d vote for the ex-president, Haley urged him to take steps to reach out to her voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d she said. Trump has made no effort to appeal to Haley voters during the march to the nomination despite his dire need to court suburban voters. And he was quick to knock down reports recently that the former South Carolina governor could be on his shortlist for the vice presidential nomination. But any accommodation between the two political foes would be a reminder that it\u2019s best not to take what happens in presidential primary campaigns too seriously. Haley, after all, went from one extreme to the other during her bid. She spent months offering only the mildest condemnations of Trump, who sought to overturn the 2020 election to stay in power. Like other GOP candidates, she was unable to solve the conundrum of how to run against the ex-president, who is still wildly popular with base voters, while avoiding alienating his supporters. When she did turn fully on Trump amid the snows of New Hampshire, it was as an act of last resort as it became clear she had no route to the nomination. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on February 1, Haley said Trump had experienced some \u201cconfused moments\u201d in prior days and rebuked the ex-president for a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d on the night of his New Hampshire primary win when he tried to push her out of the race. During an appearance in Columbia, South Carolina, Haley asked an audience:\u00a0\u201cDo you really think he is going to win against Joe Biden when he is spending that much on legal fees? He is not.\u201d On February 12, Haley told Tapper that Trump was \u201ccompletely unhinged\u201d and accused the former president of siding with Putin over NATO members. \u201cRightly or wrongly, chaos follows (Trump),\u201d Haley complained at almost every event. \u201cWe have too much division in this country, and too many threats around the world to be sitting in chaos once again.\u201d But that\u2019s the \u201cchaos\u201d she\u2019ll be voting for in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_rnc-secret-service-convention-security", "text": "A dispute over security at the Republican Party\u2019s upcoming Milwaukee convention continued to escalate on Thursday, with the GOP accusing the US Secret Service of ignoring its concerns and the agency claiming the party was undermining efforts to keep the July event safe. The Republican National Committee has been at odds with the city of Milwaukee and the Secret Service over where to place protesters outside the convention. The party has pushed to move protesters to a designated area several streets away from the pathway of convention delegates and other attendees. In a letter dated Thursday, a lawyer for the RNC blasted Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, insisting the security environment around the July convention was \u201crapidly deteriorating\u201d and demanding she force the city to move the First Amendment Zone where protesters can congregate. \u201cRather than dissipating, the overall security climate has worsened significantly over the past month of the USSS\u2019s inaction,\u201d RNC counsel Todd Steggerda wrote, adding that Cheatle\u2019s \u201cfailure to act now to prevent these unnecessary and certain risks will imperil tens of thousands of convention attendees.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Secret Service Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said the service \u201cis confident in the security plan being developed, and will continue to focus on working with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure a safe and secure event.\u201d Moreover, Guglielmi said Steggerda had endangered the event by sharing details of the security plan. The letter included maps of the proposed protest area in downtown Milwaukee. \u201cPublicly disclosing security information, as done in this letter, undermines our ability to maintain the integrity of our security plan and keep the convention, attendees, and the public safe,\u201d Guglielmi said. Guglielmi said the host city is responsible for establishing protest zones, not the agency. The RNC first publicly raised concerns to the agency over the proximity of planned protest zones in a letter last month. The risks have increased since then, Steggerda wrote Thursday, citing statements made by organizers for the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 suggesting protesters may ignore law enforcement orders related to where they can demonstrate. Steggarda also asserted that requests by RNC leadership to meet with Cheatle have gone unanswered. A number of top Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have reached out to the Secret Service to discuss their concerns, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Guglielmi, though, said Secret Service personnel in Milwaukee have held multiple meetings focused on security plans for the convention with RNC Chair Michael Whatley, RNC staff and senators. \u201cThe director of the Secret Service continues to engage with Chair Whatley,\u201d Guglielmi said. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment to the agency\u2019s response. This headline and story have been updated.
