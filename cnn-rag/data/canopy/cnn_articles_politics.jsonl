{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_joe-biden-red-line-israel", "text": "After dozens of Palestinian civilians were killed following an Israeli airstrike in Rafah this week, the White House made clear: The incident did not cross the red line President Joe Biden has drawn when it comes to providing certain American weapons to Israel. Where, exactly, that line rests remains somewhat elusive since Biden first confirmed to an interviewer in March that such a threshold exists. Biden\u2019s aides, acutely aware of previous presidents who drew red lines only to back away from any promised action when they were crossed, once dismissed talk about \u201cred lines\u201d as a media obsession. \u201cThe whole issue of the red line, as you all define it, is something that you guys like; it\u2019s almost become a bit of a\u00a0national security parlor game,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters in March, after the president suggested for the first time that an invasion of Rafah would prompt him to rethink some aspects of his policy. At the very least, however, Biden\u2019s own comments since then suggest there are actions Israel could take that would trigger a new approach from the United States. He has told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as much during telephone calls and conveyed his stance publicly in an interview with CNN. But he has remained vague about how he will quantify such a decision, leading to frustrations and a degree of confusion about his stance. Many Democrats, along with foreign leaders who the US counts as allies, say Israel\u2019s actions clearly cross a red line \u2013 if not Biden\u2019s, then their own and those of international law. \u201cPresident Biden rightly drew a red line for US support on a full-scale invasion of Rafah, but I think it\u2019s unclear to the public the difference between what we\u2019re seeing now and what would be crossing that red line,\u201d California Rep. Sara Jacobs told Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing last week \u2013 before the Israeli strike that resulted in the deaths of 45 civilians in a displacement camp. From the onset of the conflict, prompted by Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, Biden and his team have been highly wary of setting parameters on Israel\u2019s response. \u201cI\u2019m not standing up here to draw\u00a0red lines,\u201d Sullivan told reporters on October 10 when asked about the parameters of Israel\u2019s operation and how far US support would stretch. \u201cWhat I\u2019m standing up here to say is that in its hour of need, as Israel embarks on an operation to try to protect its country, protect the Jewish state of Israel, and to go after the threats that it faces \u2013 and also working closely with them hand in hand to try to secure the release and recovery of American and other hostages, we will do all of that,\u201d he added. The message from Biden and his top advisers in the weeks and months that followed was that American support would not wane, even as the president warned Netanyahu about the need to protect civilians and calibrate his military operations. The first signs of a red line It was on March 9 \u2013 as Israel was making plans to enter the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million civilians were sheltering \u2013 that Biden first confirmed a \u201cred line\u201d existed at all. \u201cWhat is your red line with Prime Minister Netanyahu? Do you have a red line? For instance, would invasion of Rafah, would you have urged him not to do? Would that be a red line?\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Jonathan Capehart asked during an interview. \u201cIt is a red line, but I\u2019m never going to leave Israel,\u201d the president responded. \u201cThe defense of Israel is still critical, so there\u2019s no red line I\u2019m going to cut off all weapons so they don\u2019t have the Iron Dome to protect them.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s red lines that if he crosses\u2026\u201d Biden went on, trailing off before finishing his thought. \u201cCannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead.\u201d The statement triggered rounds of questions at the White House. His answer, with its incomplete sentences, did not state what might constitute a violation of the red line or what his response would be. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t make any declarations or pronouncements or announcements,\u201d Sullivan told reporters in the following days. \u201cThe\u00a0red line\u00a0came up in a question.\u00a0He was responding to that question.\u00a0I think he gave a full answer to it. I think it\u2019s worth going back and reading his full answer to that question.\u201d The next week, his answer was similar. \u201cI went over the\u00a0red line\u00a0issue, which I know is the obsession of this group, last week. I\u2019ve got nothing more to say on that front,\u201d Sullivan said on March 18. \u201cAs you know, particularly for me, I think that\u2019s something that is posed in your questions; it\u2019s not stated as a declaration of our policy.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve made that clear.\u201d The next week, the same. \u201cI\u2019m just not going to get into the\u00a0parlor game\u00a0of what tripwire would be in place or what we would consider a tripwire in order to change the way we\u2019re supporting Israel in the field,\u201d he said. Whether Biden drew a red line or not, his counterpart in Israel found reason to dismiss the president\u2019s comments. \u201cYou know, I have a red line. You know what the red line is? That October 7 doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Netanyahu said, an early indication that Biden\u2019s entreaties to avoid a major operation in Rafah were not being well-received in Israel. An unclear limit is set Indeed, in the weeks that followed, the rift that had been opening between Biden and Netanyahu widened dramatically. American officials continued watching with concern as Israel made plans for going after Hamas in Rafah. Without a credible plan for protecting the civilians there, US officials warned, a humanitarian disaster would unfold. Such a plan didn\u2019t materialize, and Biden began considering steps that might limit what weapons the US provides Israel \u2014 a move he\u2019d long been averse to taking. By May 8, Biden had already paused one shipment of heavy bombs out of fear they could be used in densely populated areas like Rafah. Across the US, protests had erupted on college campuses and elsewhere calling for an end to the war. And some Democrats, including close Biden allies, began calling for conditioning US aid. Sitting down with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, Biden for the first time said he was prepared to withhold certain types of weapons should Israel move on Rafah. \u201cI made it clear that if they go into Rafah \u2013 they haven\u2019t gone in Rafah yet \u2013 if they go into Rafah, I\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently. But it\u2019s, it\u2019s just wrong.\u201d It was the clearest the president had been on when and how he might be forced to scale back his until-then limitless support. Behind the scenes, American officials said Israel was well aware of the president\u2019s thinking. But even then, his definition of \u201cgo into Rafah\u201d remained indistinct. Asked a few days later about the president\u2019s comments, Blinken insisted on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his boss had not, in fact, drawn a red line. \u201cLook, we don\u2019t talk about red lines when it comes to Israel,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cWhat the president said is that if Israel goes in with a major military operation in Rafah, in that case, there are certain systems that we will not provide to Israel that would aid that effort.\u201d White House avoids defining Biden\u2019s threshold White House aides went on to insist that a \u201cmajor military operation\u201d would be obvious should it unfold, even as they stopped short of offering qualitative criteria. \u201cWe\u2019ll make our own judgment on that as we see things unfolding, and it will be based on a totality of factors.\u00a0It\u2019s not a\u00a0mathematical\u00a0formula or a mechanical determination,\u201d Sullivan said at the White House on May 13. \u201cIt\u2019s something we will judge based on what we see.\u00a0And the president will then make his determinations.\u00a0We have not seen that happen yet.\u201d The next week, his answer expanded somewhat. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to be looking at is whether there is a lot of death and destruction from this operation or if it is more precise and proportional.\u00a0And we will see that unfold,\u201d he said on May 22. Four days later, at least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out following an Israeli military strike\u00a0on the outskirts of Rafah, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. Footage obtained by CNN showed swathes of the camp in Rafah in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. A CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts found munitions made in the United States were used in the deadly strike. The death and destruction were not in dispute, and the White House called the images \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d \u201cThe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe\u201d the situation, Vice President Kamala Harris said. Yet the episode did not meet Biden\u2019s bar for stopping certain weapons shipments. \u201cWe have not seen them go in with large units and large numbers of troops in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground,\u201d\u00a0said John Kirby, a White House national security spokesman. A major ground invasion, Kirby said, would be obvious should it begin: \u201cLots of units of tens of thousands of troops or thousands of troops moving in a coordinated set of maneuvers against a wide variety of targets on the ground in a massive way.\u00a0That\u2019s a major ground operation.\u00a0Pretty simple.\u201d One senior administration official said the strike on the displacement camp rendered the discussion moot, believing Israel will launch attacks on Rafah that are precise enough to placate Biden but not enough to mitigate the dangers to civilians. \u201cThey are trying to do it in a way that allows the administration to say it\u2019s below the line. But the net effect will be the same,\u201d the senior administration official said.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_biden-ukraine-limited-strikes-russia", "text": "President Joe Biden has given permission to Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with American munitions, though he has restricted their use so Kyiv can only hit targets over the border close to Kharkiv after Russia made significant advances around the city in the northeastern part of the country close to the Russian border, two US officials told CNN. \u201cThe president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US supplied-weapons for counterfire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\u201d one of the officials said. The loosening of the restrictions marks a break from long-standing policy and comes amid growing international pressure from close US allies. But it is limited to the area around Kharkiv,\u00a0and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, the official said, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. Politico was first to report the news. Kyiv made the request for Washington to change its policy in just the past few weeks as Russian forces have made their advance, the official said. Russian forces, ammunitions depots and logistical hubs can now be targeted with US-provided artillery and rockets across the border from Kharkiv in western Russia. The administration is also standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 200 miles, or\u00a0300 kilometers,\u00a0away. Ukraine has been allowed to use US anti-aircraft weapons to take down the imminent threat of Russian aircraft flying in both Ukrainian and Russian airspace and has done so successfully, the first official emphasized. But the prohibition has blocked Ukraine from targeting Russian aircraft that are on the ground inside Russia. Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly signaled a willingness to change the administration\u2019s tact this week when he noted that the US could \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d its position. A hallmark of US support for Ukraine \u201chas been to adapt as the conditions have changed, battlefields change, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we\u2019ve adapted and\u00a0adjusted too,\u201d\u00a0Blinken\u00a0said on Wednesday on a visit to Moldova. \u201cI am confident we will continue to do that.\u201d The previous day, key European leaders signaled they had shifted position. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf\u00a0Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\u201d Macron said during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \u201cSo how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\u201d Macron continued. Germany\u2019s Scholz echoed Macron\u2019s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law. The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes. Blinken visited Ukraine earlier this month and heard firsthand the Ukrainian request to go after targets inside Russia\u2019s border. On that trip Blinken reiterated that the US would make\u00a0sure to put Ukraine in a \u201cposition where it can deter and defend against future attacks.\u201d \u201cThe US is feeling the weight of the argument,\u201d said one European diplomat earlier this week, expecting that a change in US policy might be coming. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was quietly urging the US and other nations to give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to go after targets inside Russia,\u00a0sources said. Stoltenberg\u2019s repeated efforts behind closed doors did not immediately result in a US policy change. But he made a point this week to publicly speak to the benefit \u2013 and perhaps necessity \u2013 of allowing Ukraine the defend itself without limits. \u201cTo deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said last week.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_texas-republican-election-phelan-gonzales", "text": "Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales will win his Republican primary runoff, CNN projects, overcoming a challenge from his right from gun rights advocate and social media personality Brandon Herrera. Tuesday\u2019s race in Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, which stretches along the US-Mexico border from El Paso to the San Antonio suburbs, had been among the most expensive and bitter GOP primaries so far in 2024, drawing more than $8 million in television advertising spending. Gonzales was the only member of Texas\u2019 congressional delegation forced into a runoff after he failed to take a majority of the vote during the first round in March. First elected\u00a0in 2020 in what was then a battleground district,\u00a0Gonzales\u00a0was\u00a0censured by the Texas Republican Party last year\u00a0for a \u201clack of fidelity to Republican principles and priorities.\u201d The party took issue with several House votes cast by the congressman, including for\u00a0bipartisan gun safety legislation\u00a0and the\u00a0Respect for Marriage Act, which protected same-sex and interracial marriage. A key division\u00a0between Gonzales and Herrera came\u00a0over gun policy. The district includes Uvalde, which experienced one of the\u00a0worst school shootings in US history\u00a0two years ago that left 19 children and two teachers dead. Gonzales\u2019 vote for the gun safety bill in the aftermath of the tragedy became a centerpiece of Herrera\u2019s campaign, which had the backing of\u00a0several House Republicans, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good. The runoff offered a vivid window into the GOP\u2019s intraparty divisions, with hard-right members growing increasingly willing to derail their party\u2019s agenda if there is a whiff of compromise with Democrats. In an\u00a0interview with CNN last week, Gonzales said the primary runoff\u2019s result would send a clear message to Republicans amid a particularly discordant stretch that has seen their\u00a0speaker ousted, parts of their agenda stalled and relations roiled across the conference. \u201cAre we going to be the party that governs and gets things done in a conservative manner?\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cOr are we going to be the party that has jesters that come up here and say wild and crazy outrageous things and just try to burn the place down?\u201d Gonzales will next face Democrat Santos Limon, who won his party\u2019s nomination outright in March. The 23rd District is not on Democrats\u2019 target list this fall \u2013 Trump would have carried it under its current lines by 7 points in 2020. Texas House speaker survives Meanwhile, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, the Republican who led last year\u2019s failed effort to impeach and remove from office scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton, will win the primary runoff for his legislative seat, CNN projects. Phelan led David Covey, a former local county GOP chairman, by 366 votes as of Wednesday morning, with nearly all votes counted. Covey, who had the backing of Paxton and former President Donald Trump, has conceded the race for the Beaumont-area district. A host of influential hard-right figures in the Texas GOP came out against Phelan in the primary. The speaker finished second to Covey in the first round of voting in March, though neither took the majority needed to avoid the runoff. Paxton and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who runs the more conservative state Senate, cast Phelan as a speaker selected by Democrats \u2014 because all members of the House are allowed to vote on who oversees the chamber. \u201cAs lieutenant governor, I do not want to run the House, but I want a conservative Republican to be speaker who will run the House,\u201d Patrick said at the biennial Texas GOP convention earlier this month, The Texas Tribune reported. Phelan was the top target in Paxton\u2019s revenge tour against state House Republicans who voted to impeach him last year. The speaker was among eight state House Republicans who were forced into runoffs \u2014 a list that includes both Paxton targets and those criticized by Gov. Greg Abbott for voting against school vouchers. Among the targets was state Rep. Justin Holland, who is projected to lose the primary runoff for his Dallas-area district to Katrina Pierson, Trump\u2019s national spokesperson during his 2016 presidential campaign.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_trump-awaits-jury-verdict-analysis", "text": "The mood flips from torpor to high tension in a second on the high-security 15th floor of the grimy old Manhattan courthouse where a jury will resume deliberations on Donald Trump\u2019s fate Thursday morning. Seven men and five women jurors, headed by a foreperson who grew up in Ireland, were deep into a fourth hour of their historic task when they shattered the oppressive tedium of Wednesday afternoon. A buzzer demanding the judge\u2019s attention sounded, suddenly sending lawyers, court staff, police and reporters rushing for their seats. Then Trump arrived from his holding room, tugging heavily on his lapels. The presumptive GOP nominee sported a trademark extra-long tie \u2014 but in gold rather than his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign trail red. In the end, the alarm did not herald a verdict in the hush money trial that could brand the 45th president a convicted felon. It was a note from the jury asking for a read back of several long and dense pieces of testimony, from former tabloid kingpin David Pecker and the star prosecution witness, Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen. Their testimony gets right to the question of Trump\u2019s intent in seeking to snuff out scandalous stories about his personal life, which may shed light on the payoff to adult film star Stormy Daniels facilitated by Cohen, according to prosecutors, under his boss\u2019 orders. (Trump has denied the alleged affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case.) As Judge Juan Merchan and lawyers combed transcripts filled with complex and sometimes seedy testimony, the buzzer buzzed again, with a new request from the locked down jury. Reporters in an overflow courtroom groaned when it emerged that jurors wanted to hear Merchan\u2019s instructions \u2014 which he spent a painstaking hour reading aloud Wednesday morning \u2014 all over again. No one outside the room where 12 citizens mull a defendant\u2019s fate knows what\u2019s really going on. That didn\u2019t stop tealeaf reading on the row of television standup locations across the street. The jury\u2019s desire to wade through testimony suggested that no verdict was imminent \u2014 and that they grasped the magnitude of their duty in a case that is critical to Trump\u2019s reputation and the nation\u2019s future. Even for those armed with the publicly released courtroom transcript, Merchan\u2019s instructions were potentially confusing to the layman. The jury doesn\u2019t get a printout, according to New York law, so it\u2019s not surprising they wanted clarity. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the instructions were \u201cway too much for any human being to absorb and make sense of.\u201d The key question at the root of the trial The jury\u2019s requests highlight the big question in a prosecution that is using a novel interpretation of the law to try to hold Trump to account over the 2016 presidential election, which seems a lifetime ago. As Merchan explained, the ex-president is facing 34 charges of falsifying business records. Such an act is only a misdemeanor in New York. To convict Trump of a felony, therefore, the jury must also find that he falsified the documents to hide another crime. Prosecutors are not required to prove a secondary crime took place or even to nail down exactly what it is. In this case, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office raised the possibility of tax law infringements and the intent to falsify other documents and suggested Trump may have wanted to violate election law using \u201cunlawful\u201d means to deprive someone else of an election win. If the jury \u2014 which sat through days of testimony \u2014 needs more help, the chances of voters with only a cursory knowledge of the case forming their own strong impressions seem remote. Trump\u2019s vigil As Merchan laid out his instructions for the first time on Wednesday, Trump watched from the defense lawyers\u2019 table. He rocked back in his chair and closed his eyes, and just when it appeared he might be snoozing, shook his head contemptuously and grimaced as Merchan read out the 34th charge. At one point, Trump reached inside his jacket and pulled out a pen to write a note to his square-jawed defense lawyer Todd Blanche to his right. When his pen seemed to fail, he reached out a hand and grabbed his attorney\u2019s pen from atop his legal pad so he could scribble a message. He made sure to return Blanche\u2019s pen before returning his own to his pocket. Trump\u2019s confinement at the court all day awaiting the whims of 12 citizens of New York City \u2014 where he made his name as a tabloid-bait real estate developer \u2014 hinted at the extraordinary power imbalance revealed by this trial and his multiple legal threats. Ex-presidents cruise through life in a bubble of deference. Their magnetism lingers along with Secret Service details even after their formal powers are gone. They run on their own time and dominate every room. And Trump has long lived in rarified air, in his skyscraper penthouse, his beach club, on golf resorts boasting super-size fountains and waterfalls or on his personal Boeing. But after weeks in a courthouse built on the site of a former dungeon, Trump can only sit and watch the minutes tick by before he learns if he will enter November\u2019s election as a felon. Still, the longer the deliberations go on, the more hopes will rise in Trump\u2019s camp. They might be clutching at straws, but the ex-president\u2019s allies believe a long wait for the jury could deliver him a more favorable verdict, sources told CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes. \u201cLook, it was possible the jury was going to come back, guilty verdict in 45 minutes \u2014 every minute after that gives some hope (for a hung jury),\u201d one adviser said. The ex-president\u2019s only way of letting off steam is in a pen outside Merchan\u2019s courtroom, where he stands behind crash barriers in front of a pool of cameras and blasts the judge, the case, and falsely claims the entire process is proof of a plot by President Joe Biden to stop him from reclaiming the presidency in November. Trump\u2019s routine \u2014 aimed at voters as he seeks to delegitimize the case before the jury makes up its mind \u2014 is getting old. One new wrinkle Wednesday was his warning that the jury instructions could doom his defense. \u201cMother Theresa could not beat these charges. These charges are rigged.\u201d The jury hears none of this, so it\u2019s clear Trump is playing an outside political game. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s immediate fate is in the hands of jurors who were cross-examined for signs of political bias before the trial began and include a West Harlem man who works in sales, a young female teacher and a speech therapist. Two of the jurors are attorneys and could potentially give deliberations some structure, according to Jeff Swartz, a former Florida judge. \u201cIf the two lawyers agree with each other, that is where the jury is going to go,\u201d Swartz told CNN on Wednesday. Merchan told jurors\u00a0before sending them off to deliberate,\u00a0\u201cYou are asked to make a very important decision about another member of the community.\u201d Despite his fame, wealth and power, that is exactly who Trump is \u2014 just a lonely defendant awaiting a jury\u2019s verdict.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/trump-awaits-jury-verdict-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

More endorsements are expected in the months to come and will kick into high gear between the Democratic National Convention in August and Election Day, multiple sources told CNN.\u00a0In the meantime,\u00a0Biden\u00a0campaign officials are in discussions behind the scenes to prepare for those rollouts, stressing that they carry more influence closer to Election Day. In quick succession,\u00a0this past month, the Biden campaign\u00a0has\u00a0announced a June fundraiser with Julia Roberts and George Clooney, as well as\u00a0an ad narrated by\u00a0longtime Trump critic\u00a0Robert De Niro,\u00a0who participated in a news conference outside the former president\u2019s criminal trial on Tuesday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0showcasing the star power they\u2019ve already acquired. But political strategists working across the entertainment\u00a0business\u00a0express particular concern over Young Hollywood speaking up, which they believe can serve as a pivotal megaphone to help engage Gen Z voters and younger millennials. This year, getting younger voters out to the polls is crucial \u2013 and they\u2019re top of mind for the Biden campaign. \u201cYou still have a lot of young voters, in particular, who have not yet tuned in to the presidential election. And so that\u2019s why this campaign is relentlessly focused on reaching voters where they are right now, not waiting until September or October,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Wednesday. But\u00a0the Israel-Gaza conflict has emerged as a key issue for the TikTok generation \u2013 many of whom are first-time voters this election, and don\u2019t agree with the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the war in the Middle East. \u201cThe dream would be to get someone like Zendaya, who is the biggest Gen Z star, or Taylor Swift who covers every rubric for mass appeal,\u201d a political strategist said, though this individual does not work for the Biden campaign and\u00a0has no insight into the celebrities the campaign may be targeting. With polls showing President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump\u00a0in a tight race\u00a0ahead of Election Day in November, celebrity endorsements may hold outsize influence to help get voters to the polls this year. \u201cIt will be the usual suspects\u201d getting involved in the political process, one\u00a0celebrity\u00a0publicist told CNN. \u201cBut four years ago, who were you if you weren\u2019t speaking out?\u201d The Biden campaign had long been hoping to roll out more\u00a0big-name\u00a0supporters closer to the election, but aides in Wilmington are attempting to take a wider view and are\u00a0hoping for more than just endorsements, urging celebrities and their teams to think expansively about\u00a0maximizing their impact on social media followers\u00a0and beyond. \u201cPeople know who Biden is,\u201d Adrienne\u00a0Elrod, a senior advisor and spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN. \u201cWe need to make sure they\u2019re delivering our message to their audiences during the most important time of the campaign.\u201d Historically, Hollywood has rallied around\u00a0Democratic candidates, pushing the entertainment industry\u2019s massive influence as elections approach \u2013 but this year, there is more trepidation to speak out.\u00a0In 2008, the Obamas were\u00a0Hollywood\u2019s\u00a0it-couple, counting Clooney, Jay-Z and Beyonce as close friends. In 2016,\u00a0celebrities\u00a0fiercely\u00a0backed Hillary Clinton in her race against Trump and in 2020, stars\u00a0staunchly supported Biden to\u00a0avoid\u00a0a second Trump term. According to multiple sources consulting celebrities who spoke to CNN, celebrities are weighing whether or when to publicly endorse Biden for the 2024 election amid\u00a0an increasingly fraught\u00a0political landscape and\u00a0as simmering tensions over Israel\u2019s ongoing war in Gaza escalate across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world than it was 10 years ago. You can\u2019t make anyone happy. You can\u2019t win,\u201d another\u00a0celebrity publicist\u00a0told\u00a0CNN. \u201cCelebs feel, more than ever, that the perceived cost is higher,\u201d a political strategist who advises Hollywood stars\u00a0added. \u201cIs it even worth it?\u201d Take Mariah Carey for example:\u00a0Last December, the \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You\u201d\u00a0singer\u00a0took her two young children for a family visit at the White House, where she hung ornaments in the Oval Office and posed for photos with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. She intended to spread some holiday cheer. But\u00a0what she got in return was a scathing comment section,\u00a0filled with\u00a0accusations that she was turning a blind eye to the suffering in\u00a0war-torn\u00a0Gaza. \u201cHe is supporting and contributing to a genocide,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cAll I Want\u00a0For\u00a0Christmas is for you to open your eyes.\u201d \u201cDisgusting. Another celebrity I\u2019m ready to cross off the list,\u201d another person\u00a0commented\u00a0on Instagram. CNN has reached out to Carey\u2019s team. Aides know the 81-year-old president needs as much help\u00a0as he can get to appear in touch\u00a0with popular culture. And\u00a0while some in Hollywood are eager supporters \u2013 Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones hosted a Biden fundraiser in New York last month, Mark Hamill went in for his own Oval Office visit\u00a0earlier this month \u2013 others recognize that aligning themselves with Biden is\u00a0a risky move\u00a0in a divisive, social media-driven world. In fact, aligning with candidates \u2013 at all \u2013 this year could\u00a0prove challenging. Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, who endorsed Biden in 2020, recently\u00a0told\u00a0Fox News that he\u00a0won\u2019t\u00a0be endorsing\u00a0any\u00a0candidate this time around. And rapper Cardi B, who staunchly supported Bernie Sanders in the past and then Biden in the last election, told Rolling Stone\u00a0in a recent interview\u00a0that she won\u2019t be voting\u00a0in this election.\u00a0Over the years, Cardi B has been one of the most influential, politically active celebrities on social media to galvanize her followers to get out to the polls. But this year, she told the magazine that neither Trump nor Biden has the best interest of Americans. \u201cI don\u2019t f\u2014 with both of y\u2019all,\u201d\u00a0she bluntly said. Endorsements still seen as key, even in a tense\u00a0time Even before the war erupted in the Middle East,\u00a0celebrities and their teams had been grappling with when and on which topics to vocalize potentially controversial opinions in an increasingly fraught United States \u2013 especially as a large portion of the country has continued to show support for Trump. In a show of the power of celebrity,\u00a0a star-studded Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March raked in a\u00a0then-record $26 million for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Ben Platt, Cynthia\u00a0Erivo\u00a0and Lea Michele performed at the glitzy New York City gathering that brought together Biden with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton\u00a0in conversation with Stephen Colbert. Even then, Israel\u2019s war in Gaza loomed large over the evening\u00a0with protestors inside and outside\u00a0the venue. Such\u00a0endorsements are part of a strategy to get to voters who may otherwise be hard to reach, according to Alyssa Cass, a Democratic political consultant and partner at Slingshot Strategies, who explained, \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking for cues on how to vote, someone you watch in the movies or watch playing sports that you like more than either of the two candidates, that\u2019s something to go on.\u201d Celebrities\u00a0may be particularly important in an election year where neither candidate is especially popular among voters, Cass said, adding that the timing of their endorsement is also crucial. \u201cYou want it to be much closer to the election when those infrequent or non-voters or first-time voters are really starting to pay attention,\u201d she said. A Democratic strategist\u00a0said that celebrities are \u201creally good to capture attention and get earned media and get a crowd to get out the vote,\u201d adding that\u00a0some\u00a0celebrities are privately sharing they\u2019re not comfortable endorsing a candidate right now but are expected to come around as Election Day nears. In 2020, some high-profile celebrities endorsed Biden closer to Election Day, including Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez \u2013 all of whom backed Biden in October of that year. For celebrities, the upside in aligning themselves politically is\u00a0taking advantage of the responsibility and privilege that comes with a massive public platform to rally for issues they believe can improve the country. \u201cCelebrities are not going to be saying, \u2018I\u2019m so passionate about Joe.\u2019 But they will, even at a distance, be supporting Biden,\u201d one of the celebrity advisors who spoke with CNN said.\u00a0\u201cEveryone will find their path and will find ways that are helpful ultimately to Joe Biden \u2013 but they might just not\u00a0standing\u00a0there with Joe Biden.\u201d Behind the scenes, Hollywood plots political involvement High-powered agents, publicists,\u00a0managers,\u00a0and strategists have been participating in regularly scheduled Zoom meetings to discuss organizing and mobilizing voters, multiple sources told CNN. And exclusive fundraisers \u2013 without cameras \u2013\u00a0have shown the extent of Hollywood\u2019s support, including one hosted last December by movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, a longtime Democratic supporter who is co-chair of Biden\u2019s campaign. Steven Spielberg, Katzenberg\u2019s DreamWorks co-founder, also recently took on a role with the reelection campaign to provide strategy for the Democratic National Convention, according to a source familiar. During a visit to Los Angeles earlier this year, Biden had an intimate, private meeting with heavy hitters in Black Hollywood. The off-the-record and candid conversation centered around the issues that matter most to the Black community, according to a source with knowledge of the gathering. \u201cThere is the performative celebrity, and then there is the celebrity who does the work behind the scenes,\u201d a top talent representative said.\u00a0\u201cJust because someone isn\u2019t posting or hosting an event doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not being active.\u201d Many Hollywood reps who spoke to CNN believe the historically engaged Democratic celebrity activists will show up to stump for Biden as the election approaches \u2014 the likes of Eva Longoria, Shonda Rhimes and Connie Britton, who has already sent out a Biden fundraising email. Israel-Hamas war creates\u00a0a Hollywood PR\u00a0disaster As the\u00a0war\u00a0in Gaza drags on, the White House\u2019s\u00a0handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has made Biden increasingly unpopular among many voters \u2013\u00a0 with 71% of voters\u00a0disapproving,\u00a0according to a\u00a0CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The war has become especially toxic in Hollywood, showcasing a rare moment of deep divide in an industry that is typically unified on public messaging. Stars like Susan Sarandon, who was\u00a0fired by her agency\u00a0for comments she made at a pro-Palestinian rally perceived to be antisemitic,\u00a0have lost work. And \u201cZone of Interest\u201d director Jonathan Glazer was denounced by over 1,000 Jewish professionals in an open letter, after he said the Holocaust has been\u00a0\u201chijacked by an occupation, which has led to conflict for so many innocent people\u201d\u00a0during his Oscars acceptance speech. \u201cIn Hollywood, there is this real dividing line on Israel and Gaza. Something as simple as which pin you wear on the red carpet \u2013 it\u2019s like putting on a jersey,\u201d said Democratic political strategist Jordan C. Brown, who has worked closely with celebrities in advisory roles for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and\u00a0Obama. Throughout award season, pro-Palestinian stars like\u00a0Ramy\u00a0Youssef, Billie\u00a0Eilish\u00a0and Mark Ruffalo wore\u00a0\u201cArtists4Ceasefire\u201d pins, while others wore yellow ribbon pins to call for the release of the hostages held in Gaza.\u00a0Rapper Macklemore released a song\u00a0earlier this month praising college students who are protesting the war and vowed that he wouldn\u2019t vote for Biden in November. The\u00a0Artists4Ceasefire petition\u00a0launched shortly after Israel\u2019s retaliatory strikes began in Gaza following Hamas\u2019\u00a0October 7\u00a0attack.\u00a0Hundreds\u00a0of Hollywood signatories\u00a0urged\u00a0Biden\u00a0to call\u00a0for a permanent ceasefire, including Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Cynthia Nixon, Drake,\u00a0Dua\u00a0Lipa and America\u00a0Ferrera. Some pro-Israel, Jewish celebrities have spoken out to raise awareness for the hostages and have made trips to Israel, including actress Debra Messing, Tiffany\u00a0Haddish,\u00a0and music executive Scooter Braun.\u00a0Comedian Michael Rapaport, who has historically been one of Trump\u2019s loudest critics, recently said on his Instagram that he now thinks Trump is going to win the election because of \u201canti-Jewish screaming on college campuses.\u201d Brown said\u00a0that the division in Hollywood echoes the real-world problems for the Biden administration. \u201cFor Arab Americans, Biden and Harris are perceived as being totally in the tank of Israel. But for American Jews, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Brown said. Hollywood expected to rally around key issues, like\u00a0abortion Multiple individuals who work at the intersection of celebrity and politics expressed a sense of trepidation across Hollywood to publicly endorse Biden at this stage,\u00a0but a willingness to engage more on policy \u2013 especially\u00a0on key issues like climate change and abortion. \u201cHollywood will go hard for reproductive health and reproductive freedom. There is no downside,\u201d Brown said. Sources told CNN they believe that abortion\u00a0bans across states will drive celebrities to get involved in the election. Sheryl Lee Ralph\u00a0recently joined Harris for a Pennsylvania campaign event focused on reproductive freedom. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to\u00a0not\u00a0engage and let Donald Trump pass a federal restriction on abortion,\u201d said an A-list adviser who works to pair major stars with cause-based initiatives.\u00a0\u201cRepublican positions on issues will drive celebrity enthusiasm.\u201d Aside from abortion, climate change will be a key issue for Hollywood\u00a0as it\u00a0has long been a top cause for\u00a0celebrity environmentalists\u00a0like Leonardo DiCaprio,\u00a0who endorsed Biden in the past. \u201cDo you want billions and trillions of dollars spent on the environment, or not? You can\u2019t make an argument, at all, that Donald Trump has been better on that issue than Biden,\u201d the advisor sayid. In recent months,\u00a0celebrities have been engaging with the administration on their top issues. Kim Kardashian\u00a0recently joined\u00a0Harris at the White House for a roundtable to discuss pardons issued by Biden. Kardashian\u00a0also visited Trump\u00a0during his presidency on the same issue. Back in January, Halle Berry sat down with first lady Dr. Jill Biden to discuss women\u2019s health. But there may be no galvanizing force more powerful for some in Hollywood than beating Trump. \u201cBiden is complicated to support right now for a number of reasons,\u201d another publicist said. \u201cBut the other option is absolutely not supportable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/celebrity-endorsements-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_rfk-jr-fec-complaint-cnn-debate", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday alleging President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and CNN violated federal campaign laws in scheduling the network\u2019s\u00a0June 27 presidential debate. The complaint alleges CNN \u201ccolluded\u201d with the Biden and Trump campaigns in scheduling the debate and setting debate qualification criteria, which the Kennedy team claims amounts to \u201cprohibited corporate contributions\u201d to both campaigns. The Biden campaign directed a request for comment to the Democratic National Committee, which declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Kennedy campaign asks the FEC to bar the campaigns and CNN from holding the debate until they address the alleged breaches in federal law. The complaint marks the latest step in Kennedy\u2019s push to appear on the debate stage alongside Biden and Trump. He has frequently argued that the scheduling of the debate unfairly excluded him since the\u00a0event was announced earlier this month. In order to participate in CNN\u2019s debate, candidates must be qualified on enough state ballots to be eligible for 270 electoral votes. Candidates must also earn at least 15% support in four national polls that meet CNN\u2019s polling standards. The window for candidates to earn qualifying polls opened March 13th\u00a0and closes seven days prior to the debate. Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 Electoral College votes. He has earned at least 15% support in three qualifying polls. The Kennedy campaign argues that the qualification criteria are not objective and claims Biden and Trump would not be qualified on any states\u2019 ballot because their parties\u2019 nominating conventions will occur after the debate. \u201cBy demanding our campaign meet different criteria to participate in the debate than Presidents Biden and Trump, CNN\u2019s debate violates FEC law and is a large prohibited corporate contribution to both the Biden and Trump campaigns,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement announcing the filing. A CNN spokesperson said both Biden and Trump will meet the ballot access criteria as the presumptive nominees of their parties. \u201cThe law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/rfk-jr-fec-complaint-cnn-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_supreme-court-trump-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite Supreme Court justices might not even be the three he nominated. Trump congratulated Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush, after the jurist on Wednesday refused to recuse himself from cases related to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol or the 2020 election. Alito said in a letter to lawmakers that he didn\u2019t know that his wife had raised an upside-down flag in the days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021. In any event, the deeds of his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, don\u2019t meet his threshold for recusal. Alito\u00a0also\u00a0addressed\u00a0the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag \u2013 which some interpret as pushing for more religion in the public space and has also become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 that was flown at the justice\u2019s New Jersey beach house last summer.\u00a0He said his wife flew the flag, which dates back to the American Revolution, and neither was aware of its current connotation. But Trump was doing the social media equivalent of a fist pump at Alito\u2019s declaration when he said this on his social media platform: Congratulations to United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for showing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u201cGUTS\u201d to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related. All U.S. Judges, Justices, and Leaders should have such GRIT - Our Country would be far more advanced than its current status as A BADLY FAILING NATION, headed by the Worst President in American History, Crooked Joe Biden! The Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether Trump, as a former president, should enjoy some level of super immunity from prosecution. It\u2019s a complicated case, but certainly Alito was one of the justices most open to immunity claims during oral arguments in April. Alito is also the justice who wrote the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the landmark opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion for American women. While Trump has waffled on how to handle the abortion issue now that there is a patchwork of laws across the country, his latest position is to leave the matter up to states, not unlike what Alito suggested in writing the opinion. The actions of Alito\u2019s wife, flying an upside-down flag as part of a neighborhood dispute over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, are well within someone\u2019s First Amendment rights. It\u2019s also true that the Alitos\u2019  judgment in how a Supreme Court justice should appear objective is suspect. These relatively innocuous, political expressions pale in comparison to the actions of another Supreme Court spouse: Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, who in addition to being married to Justice Clarence Thomas (who was nominated in 1991 by George H.W. Bush) is a conservative activist featured prominently in the House January 6 report. She was actively strategizing around the fake elector scheme by which Trump\u2019s allies wanted to upend Biden\u2019s victory. In text messages with Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Ginni Thomas referred to the 2020 election as a \u201cheist.\u201d She later told the January 6 committee she regretted the messages. Unlike Alito, who responded to lawmakers\u2019 calls for his recusal, Thomas has stayed silent on the matter, although it is clear at this point he will not be recusing himself from any January 6-related cases. Read more from CNN\u2019s Devan Cole. The perception of political bias among Supreme Court spouses does not necessarily mean anything about the political leanings of their powerful husbands, although Alito and Thomas form the core of the conservative majority that currently dominates the Supreme Court.

Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful.

CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_louisiana-ten-commandments-classrooms", "text": "Schools in Louisiana could soon be required by law to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom. The state House of Representatives gave final passage to\u00a0House Bill 71\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0in a 79-16 vote, sending it to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s desk. Only Democrats voted against the legislation. If the governor signs it into law, every Louisiana classroom \u2014 from kindergarten through university level \u2014 at schools that receive state funding would be required to display \u201con a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches. The text of the Ten Commandments shall be the central focus of the poster or framed document and shall be printed in a large, easily readable font,\u201d according to the text of the bill. HB 71 also specifies the exact language that must be printed on the classroom displays. Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton has said the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \u201cmoral code\u201d in the classroom. She dismissed concerns from Democrats and other opponents that a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms would violate the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d In defending the bill, supporters leaned on the 2022\u00a0US Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The Supreme Court ruled that the coach\u2019s prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.\u00a0At the time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the establishment clause by permitting religious expression in public. If signed into law, legal challenges are expected to quickly follow. CNN has inquired with Landry\u2019s office as to whether he plans to sign. In a joint statement, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the legislation. \u201cThis bill is unconstitutional. The state may not require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Many faith-based and civil-rights organizations oppose this measure because it violates students\u2019 and families\u2019 fundamental right to religious freedom,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe are closely monitoring this situation and urge Louisianans to let the governor know that he should veto this bill. Politicians should not be forcing religious scripture on students. Our public schools are not Sunday schools, and students of all faiths\u2014or no faith\u2014should feel welcome in them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/louisiana-ten-commandments-classrooms/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. He clarified on May 29 in a letter to lawmakers that he would not recuse himself from any cases as a result of the flag controversy. His wife, Alito said, is entitled to her First Amendment rights. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d\u00a0Alito\u00a0wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this month, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_donald-trump-judgment-day-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump, who built a mystique as the brash epitome of power, has never been more powerless to dictate his own fate. His reputation, future, and even perhaps the White House\u2019s destiny, will on Wednesday be placed in the hands of 12 citizens of his native New York City, proving that not even once-and-possibly future commanders in chief are above the law. Seven men and five women jurors will retire for deliberations on Trump\u2019s six-week hush money trial after Judge Juan Merchan instructs them on the law and their duties. No jury in American history has faced such a task \u2014 deciding whether a former president and presumptive major party nominee will be convicted of a crime. And while the jury, which can deliberate for as long as it needs, is bound to decide its verdict on 34 felony charges on the testimony and evidence in the case alone, its decision will reverberate across the nation and the world at a critical moment of the 2024 presidential election. The trial slogged toward its end on Tuesday in nearly 10 hours of closing arguments that burst into open hostility between rival lawyers. \u201cYou have to put aside the distractions, the press, the politics, the noise. Focus on the evidence and the logical inference that can be drawn from that evidence,\u201d prosecution lawyer Joshua Steinglass told the jury. \u201cIn the interest of justice and in the name of the people of the state of the New York, I ask you to find the defendant guilty. Thank you.\u201d Prosecutors accused the ex-president of \u201ca conspiracy and a cover-up\u201d and of betraying 2016 voters by illegally falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the election. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty in this first of four looming criminal cases\u00a0\u2014 which may be the only one to go to trial before November\u2019s election. In order to convict Trump, jurors must first decide that he falsified financial documents and did so with the express purpose of committing another crime. The ex-president watched quietly but intently in court Tuesday after days of firing off furious rhetorical assaults on the judge, prosecutors and the legal system. His lead defense counsel, Todd Blanche, tried to eviscerate the credibility of the case\u2019s central witness, Michael Cohen, branding the self-described former Trump \u201cthug\u201d as the \u201cGLOAT\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe Greatest Liar of All Time,\u201d while insisting there was no crime and no proof Trump orchestrated the plan to pay off Daniels. And conjuring a dark image that seemed to capture his client\u2019s cynical view of democracy, Blanche said: \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\u201d The former president, who chose not to testify in his own defense, looked on, often with his arm draped across a chair, in the unusual position of having to leave others to speak for him. Trump has now spent six ignominious weeks breathing the stale air of a foreboding tower block of a courthouse that has dispensed justice to some of New York\u2019s most storied murderers, crooks and Mafia dons. The yellowing white-wash, austere furniture and florescent lights that form the soulless abyss of America\u2019s criminal justice system may have been an insult to the eyes of a developer who frequently boasts about the splendor of his buildings and is more at home under the glistening chandeliers and gold-leafed opulence of his multiple residencies. The final stages of any criminal trial reach a somber register as the gravity of the moment for the accused begins to come into view. In this case, which is entwined with a presidential election that will decide the country\u2019s future, the consequences are even more profound. And there\u2019s also a poignant personal dimension. The city where Trump made his name and reshaped the skyline while romping through the tabloid era of the 1980s is about to judge its estranged son. A political circus erupts outside the court Events outside the courtroom highlighted the rising stakes of the eventual verdict just five months from a currently tight election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Hollywood legend Robert De Niro showed up on behalf of the Biden campaign to blast \u201cthe loser Trump,\u201d accompanied by some of the police officers beaten up by the ex-president\u2019s mob in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The star of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d \u2014 a New York City icon in his own right \u2014 got into a quintessential finger-pointing standoff with a heckling bystander spreading misinformation about the assault on the Capitol. Moments later, Trump\u2019s adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, showed up for their father, who has come perilously close to incurring a jail spell for repeatedly violating a gag order. \u201cWe understand that this is a political persecution. That was evidenced, today by the Biden campaign themselves holding a rally here,\u201d Don Trump Jr. said. \u201cThey bring in Robert De Niro \u2026 but apparently he needs attention because it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s cranked out a good movie.\u201d The Biden campaign has tried to keep its distance from Trump\u2019s criminal tribulations, partly to avoid accusations like those from the ex-president\u2019s camp on Tuesday. But its decision to engage as the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s trial reached a pivotal point began to answer the question of how Biden\u2019s team will react to the end of the trial \u2014 and Trump\u2019s emergence from weeks of the campaign trail being diverted through the courtroom. Despite the circus unfolding outside the court, there is no sign that the trial has gripped the national imagination like previous celebrity cases \u2014 such as the O.J. Simpson saga or the trial of the late King of Pop Michael Jackson. That\u2019s partly to do with the lack of television cameras in Merchan\u2019s courtroom. Some polls have, however, suggested that a guilty verdict could give some Republican voters pause about choosing a convicted felon in November, despite the way Trump weaponized his legal woes as an asset in the GOP primary and his strategy of portraying himself as a persecuted victim in the general election. In a close White House race, only a few thousand defections from the former president could have an outsize effect since the result is likely to be decided in only a handful of swing states by tens of thousands of votes. If Trump is convicted, he\u2019s sure to lash out and redouble his vow to dedicate any second presidency to personal and political \u201cretribution\u201d in a way that could play into Biden\u2019s dominant campaign theme that US democracy is in mortal peril. An acquittal, on the other hand, could validate for Trump\u2019s supporters his claims that all his legal woes are a witch-hunt. The defense rounds yet again on Michael Cohen Trump bitterly complained on Tuesday that the defense got the right to deliver the first summation, meaning that the prosecution argument could be freshest in the jurors\u2019 minds when they come to deliberate. But he didn\u2019t mention that is how the law works in New York state. On one of the most critical days of Trump\u2019s life, Blanche set out about methodically dismantling the prosecution case, seeking to cast reasonable doubt on multiple examples of testimony and evidence. To begin, as Blanche spoke calmly and conversationally, there were none of the often self-defeating histrionics that the ex-president sometimes demands of his lawyers. All Blanche had to do was to cast doubt in the mind of one juror, which could force the judge to declare a mistrial if the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict. \u201cWe have no burden to prove anything,\u201d Blanche told the jury. \u201cThe burden is always on the government.\u201d Blanche insisted that Cohen did considerable legal work for Trump as his private attorney, countering prosecution arguments that payments made to him once Trump became president were disguised reimbursements for the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Daniels. He told jurors that there was no proof that Trump orchestrated a scheme to subvert the 2016 election or that he even knew what staffers were doing in his name. The attorney returned time and time again to the credibility of Cohen, the most important prosecution witness, portraying him as a serial liar who was caught \u201cred handed\u201d not telling the truth on the stand and who was making millions of dollars on the back of Trump\u2019s legal storm. \u201cYou cannot convict President Trump,\u201d Blanche said, before repeating himself for emphasis while impressing on the jury the gravity of the historic deliberation that lies before them. \u201cYou cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the words of Michael Cohen.\u201d At the end of his summation, Blanche listed 10 reasons why jurors should have reasonable doubt \u2014 including that there was no intent to falsify documents on Trump\u2019s part and no evidence of an orchestrated attempt to meddle in the 2016 election, while arguing that Trump\u2019s intent was to keep stories about Daniels from embarrassing his family. Blanche kept his Trumpiest flourish for his last moments with the jury \u2014 pleading with them not to send the ex-president to prison, in an infringement of legal etiquette and incurring the fury of Merchan. After the jurors returned from a break, the judge warned that their job was to judge the evidence, not to speculate on what punishments Trump might face if he is found guilty. Prosecution expands its case on election interference Steinglass opened his final argument with a long rebuttal of Blanche\u2019s summation, as he sought to show that Cohen\u2019s credibility was not a deal breaker and that in any case the charges were carried by other testimony. Steinglass repeatedly billed the alleged crime not as a seedy attempt to hide a personal transgression but a threat to the integrity of the electoral system. \u201cYou may say, who cares if Mr. Trump slept with a porn star 10 years before the 2016 election? Many people feel that way. It\u2019s harder to say the American people don\u2019t have the right to decide for themselves whether they care or not,\u201d he said. Some observers have suggested that the extraordinary precedent of indicting and trying an ex-president should stem from an alleged offense that threatens the integrity of the republic itself. Trump\u2019s other looming trials \u2014 including over the attempt to subvert the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 might come closer to reaching this bar. But Steinglass dismissed the notion that the current case is relatively trivial. He said the value of the \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d involved \u201ccannot be overstated.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign,\u201d adding that \u201cthis scheme cooked up by these men at this time could very well be what got President Trump elected.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/donald-trump-judgment-day-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_alito-flag-controversy-response-supreme-court", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers in a letter Wednesday that he will not recuse from cases involving the 2020 presidential election or the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot despite concerns about two controversial flags that have flown on his properties. \u201cThe two incidents you cite do not meet the conditions for recusal,\u201d Alito wrote in a letter distributed by the Supreme Court. \u201cAs I have stated publicly, I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention.\u201d The letter is a highly unusual response, underscoring how the revelations about the flags have dogged Alito for days. Supreme Court justices rarely get into a back-and-forth with lawmakers and many members of the court do not explain their reasons for recusing \u2013 or not. The Supreme Court is weighing major cases tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building. Repeating claims he made previously about an upside-down US flag that flew at his Alexandria, Virginia, home in early 2021, Alito said the decision to place the flag was his wife\u2019s. And he blamed that decision on a \u201cvery nasty neighborhood dispute.\u201d \u201cMy wife is a private citizen, and she possesses the same First Amendment rights as every other American,\u201d Alito wrote in one of two letters sent to members of Congress. \u201cShe makes her own decisions, and I have always respected her right to do so.\u201d \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d Appeal to Heaven flag controversy A second controversial flag \u2013 the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, but also has become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 flew at the Alitos\u2019 vacation home in New Jersey. The justice on Wednesday said he was aware of the flag but didn\u2019t know how long it was flown. Alito said he was not familiar with the flag\u2019s meaning and said his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, also hoisted that one. \u201cI had no involvement in the decision to fly that flag,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI was not aware of any connection between that historic flag and the \u2018Stop the Steal Movement,\u2019 and neither was my wife. She did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings.\u201d Citing the code of conduct the Supreme Court adopted recently in response to another series of scandals, Alito said the flags did not constitute grounds for recusal. Alito said he was \u201cduty bound\u201d to reject requests from members of Congress to recuse. One of the letters was addressed to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who had requested that Alito recuse from cases involving the attack on the Capitol. Another was addressed to members of the House who had made similar demands. \u201cA reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request.\u201d Durbin in a statement said his committee has been reviewing the recent reporting on Alito as part of their investigation of \u201cethical lapses by some justices on the Supreme Court.\u201d The Illinois Democrat called the flying of the upside-down flag \u201ca signal of defiance, which raises reasonable questions about bias and fairness in cases pending before the Court.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day, the Chief Justice can end this spiraling decline in America\u2019s confidence in our highest Court by taking decisive action to establish a credible code of conduct,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI will continue to pursue what the American people are demanding: accountability, transparency, and an enforceable code of conduct for Supreme Court justices.\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who chairs a Senate Judiciary subcommittee looking into court ethics, used the recent revelations to push for passage of his Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act, which he introduced last year following media reports about Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 pattern of nondisclosure on his financial reports for years. \u201cJustice Alito\u2019s story conflicts with the accounts of other people involved, and the Supreme Court \u2014 uniquely in all of government \u2014 has no mechanism for getting to the truth.\u00a0If the Court won\u2019t create one, then we need to, and my SCERT Act would do that,\u201d the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who also sits on the Senate Judiciary committee, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source\u201d late Wednesday that Alito\u2019s explanation \u201cdefies common sense.\u201d The Connecticut Democrat also urged Chief Justice John Roberts to \u201cshow some spine\u201d and \u201cuse his moral and political force on the court and take actions\u201d like refusing to assign opinions to\u00a0Alito and Thomas. \u201cThose kinds of\u00a0steps may seem small, but they\u00a0would send a very powerful\u00a0message,\u201d he added. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, said Alito\u2019s response demonstrated a need for Congress to step in to approve an enforceable code of ethics on the high court. \u201cAny unbiased and reasonable person would find laughable Justice Alito\u2019s \u2018the dog ate my homework, and I didn\u2019t even know I had homework\u2019 defense,\u201d Johnson said. While congressional Democrats slammed Alito\u2019s refusal to recuse himself, Trump praised the conservative justice\u2019s move. \u201cCongratulations\u00a0to United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for showing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u2018GUTS\u2019 to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social. Spat with neighbors The revelation of the flag came from a May 17 report from the New York Times. The outlet published a photo of the inverted American flag on January 17, 2021. Following the story, Alito said in a statement he had \u201cno involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag\u201d and that it was \u201cbriefly\u201d flown by his wife in response to a neighbor\u2019s yard signs, one of which, the justice told Fox News, read \u201cF**k Trump.\u201d Neighbors with whom CNN spoke following reports of the flag said they recalled the flag being inverted but said they didn\u2019t know what it meant and there was no public reaction at the time. According to the Times, a neighbor involved in the exchange with\u00a0Martha-Ann Alito\u00a0called police after several encounters with the justice\u2019s wife in early 2021, after the neighbor had placed yard signs which were critical of Republicans and the justice. Justice Alito also told Fox News the neighbor used the term \u201cc*nt\u201d at one point during the exchanges. Pictures obtained by the Times show the neighbor holding signs that include \u201cAlito was @ Jan6\u201d along with \u201cAbort SCOTUS\u201d following the ruling 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_biden-philadelphia-black-voters", "text": "President Joe Biden launched a nationwide effort to mobilize Black voters during a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday, aiming to win back support from a slice of the electorate that polls show wavering in support. Joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and a slate of Black elected officials, Biden boosted his achievements while also warning of what his campaign calls a \u201cracist and toxic agenda\u201d being peddled by his rival, former President Donald Trump. He warned the threats posed by a second Trump term would be graver than the first time around, and said his rival was running a campaign of vengeance after losing in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s running again and he\u2019s clearly unhinged. He called insurrectionists patriots quote patriots,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf reelected, he wants to pardon every one of them. Let me ask you - what do you think he would\u2019ve done on January 6 if Black Americans had stormed? Think about it - if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? Don\u2019t think he\u2019d be talking about pardons.\u201d The launch of Black Voters for Biden-Harris, held at a majority-Black prep school in Philadelphia, was intended to revive another corner of the coalition that helped propel Biden to the White House in 2020. It\u2019s his third stop for an event in the city this year; he held seven events in Philadelphia in 2023. Biden didn\u2019t mince his words in describing Trump\u2019s record, saying he \u201cis the same guy who wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd\u2019s murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park five guilty, even though they\u2019re exonerated.\u201d Biden\u2019s aides say they aren\u2019t taking Black voters for granted as surveys suggest an erosion of support, particularly among Black men. \u201cListen, we know right now that we\u2019re operating in an incredibly fractured and fragmented media environment, you still have a lot of young voters in particular who have not yet tuned in to the presidential election,\u201d communications director Michael Tyler told CNN ahead of Biden\u2019s speech. \u201cAnd so, that\u2019s why this campaign is relentlessly focused on reaching voters where they are right now, not waiting until September or October as some campaigns have done in the past \u2013 to reach out to\u00a0Black\u00a0voters, young\u00a0Black\u00a0voters in particular, but using every tool at our disposal right now to do so.\u201d Still, the results of those efforts have proven elusive. Many polls have found Black voters more disconnected from the Democratic Party than they have been in decades. A\u00a0New York Times/Siena College survey\u00a0of battleground states released this month found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden, which would amount to a historic high if it translates to votes in November. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in\u00a0CNN\u2019s exit poll. Perhaps more worrisome than a shift to Trump, according to some of Biden\u2019s allies, is a fear that Black voters will sit the election out entirely. Nowhere would that be more problematic than in Philadelphia, whose strong showing for Democrats in past elections \u2014 particularly among its Black population \u2014 has helped deliver Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral votes. Biden has aggressively courted Black voters this month, including a multi-day stretch commemorating the\u00a0historic Brown v. Board of Education case that found laws promoting segregation unconstitutional, campaign stops in Atlanta, a commencement address at Morehouse College and a speech at an NAACP dinner in Detroit. He\u2019s also dialed into Black radio programs and touted issues like infrastructure investments and\u00a0canceling student debt when promoting his record to Black voters. Following Wednesday\u2019s rally in Philadelphia, Biden plans to deliver another set of remarks at a Black-owned small business, attended by members of the city\u2019s Black Chamber of Commerce. As the summer progresses, the Black Voters for Biden-Harris organizational effort will partner with community groups to register voters and strengthen voter protection efforts. Key to the effort, the campaign says, will be engagement with networks of \u201ctrusted messengers\u201d within Black communities and engagement events in battleground states \u2014 including at churches, block parties, barber shops and hair salons. Trump has tried in his own way to court Black voters, even as the Republican Party shut down minority outreach centers in some battleground states. Sometimes his efforts have trafficked in stereotypes \u2013 at a gala in South Carolina earlier this year, Trump suggested Black voters like him more after his criminal charges. \u201cA lot of people said that that\u2019s why the\u00a0Black\u00a0people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I\u2019m being discriminated against,\u201d Trump said in February \u2013 comments that the White House and Biden campaign condemned. And at a rally in Bronx last week, Trump sought to showcase his support among the Black community by posing with hip-hop artists\u00a0\u2013 an effort one Biden adviser likened to a \u201cjanky rap concert.\u201d Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents areas of North Philadelphia, rejected the notion Trump was making inroads with Black voters. \u201cYou can go to places where Black people live, but that\u2019s not outreach to the Black community,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou look at that crowd on the Bronx. It was a bunch of people who don\u2019t know Jenny from the Block. They\u2019ve never been to the Bronx. They came from wherever they came from, to hear him tell the same lies over and over and over again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/biden-philadelphia-black-voters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_supreme-court-first-amendment", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously backed the National Rifle Association in a First Amendment ruling that could make it harder for state regulators to pressure advocacy groups. The decision means the NRA may continue to pursue its lawsuit against a New York official who urged banks and insurance companies to cut ties with the gun rights group following the 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida,\u202fhigh school that left 17 people dead. \u201cGovernment officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most senior liberal, wrote for the court. \u201cUltimately, the critical takeaway is that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from wielding their power selectively to punish or suppress speech,\u201d Sotomayor added. The NRA claimed that Maria Vullo, the former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, not only leaned on insurance companies to part ways with the gun lobby but threatened enforcement actions against those firms if they failed to comply. At the center of the dispute was a meeting Vullo had with insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London in 2018 in which the NRA claims she offered to not prosecute other violations as long as the company helped with the campaign against gun groups. Vullo tried to wave off the significance of the meeting, arguing in part that the NRA\u2019s allegations of what took place were not specific. Vullo, who served in Democratic former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration, said her enforcement targeted an insurance product that is illegal in New York: third-party policies sold through the NRA that cover personal injury and criminal defense costs following the use of a firearm. Critics dubbed the policies \u201cmurder insurance.\u201d The decision will provide some clarity to government regulators \u2014 both liberal and conservative \u2014 about how far they may go to pressure private companies that do business with controversial advocacy groups. \u201cThis is a landmark victory for the NRA and all who care about our First Amendment freedom,\u201d William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the association, said in a statement. \u201cThe opinion confirms what the NRA has known all along: New York government officials abused the power of their office to silence a political enemy.\u201d An attorney for Vullo said they were \u201cdisappointed by the court\u2019s decision\u201d but noted that a lower court that previously sided with her on a different legal basis may ultimately reaffirm that decision. \u201cMs. Vullo did not violate anyone\u2019s First Amendment rights,\u201d the attorney, Neal Katyal, said in a statement. \u201cMs. Vullo enforced the insurance law against admitted violations by insurance entities, and\u00a0industry letters such as those issued by Ms. Vullo are routine and important tools regulators use to inform and advise the entities they oversee about risks.\u201d Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch and liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned two separate concurrences in which they said they agreed with the court\u2019s decision. In her six-page concurrence, Jackson stressed that cases like the one at hand turn heavily on the facts that give rise to the controversy. \u201cWhether and how government coercion of a third party might violate another party\u2019s First Amendment rights will depend on the facts of the case,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDifferent circumstances \u2014 who is being coerced to do what, and why \u2014 may implicate different First Amendment inquiries.\u201d The court\u2019s opinion made no mention of another pending and related case dealing with whether the Biden administration went too far in pressuring social media platforms like X and Facebook to remove content it views as misinformation. The cases were argued on the same day in March. While the NRA is more likely to be at the Supreme Court making Second Amendment arguments, it picked up unfamiliar allies with its First Amendment claim. The American Civil Liberties Union, which usually sits opposite the NRA in the debate over guns, agreed to represent the group before the Supreme Court. A US district court denied some of the NRA\u2019s claims but allowed its First Amendment arguments to proceed against Vullo. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision, concluding that Vullo\u2019s actions were not coercive. It also ruled that Vullo was entitled to qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that shields government officials from lawsuits in some circumstances. The NRA largely relied on a 1963 Supreme Court decision,\u202fBantam Books v. Sullivan, that dealt with a Rhode Island commission that had threatened to refer distributors to police if they sold books deemed to be obscene. The Supreme Court held that such \u201cinformal censorship\u201d was unconstitutional.

And they know what happened here, and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the\u00a0Manhattan\u00a0courtroom. News of Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, sent shockwaves through campaigns up and down the ballot. Republican candidates in races for governor, Senate and House largely aligned themselves with Trump, while Democrats largely avoided the specifics of the case but said justice had prevailed. The former president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill were quick to rally around him, with top Republicans attacking the justice system in the wake of the verdict \u2013 while also highlighting the importance of the\u00a02024\u00a0election and making fundraising appeals of their own. House Speaker Mike Johnson decried what he described as \u201cthe weaponization of our justice system,\u201d\u00a0saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump will rightfully appeal this absurd verdict \u2014 and he WILL WIN.\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise wrote on\u00a0social media, \u201cI won\u2019t stand by while the leader of our party is ambushed by our own government.

Senate GOP candidates back Trump Republican Senate candidates also quickly sided with the former president. Tim Sheehy,\u00a0who is\u00a0challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, issued a statement declaring the verdict \u201cRIGGED\u201d and called\u00a0the case\u00a0\u201cstate-sponsored political persecution.\u201d Kari Lake, the Republican poised to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in Arizona\u2019s Senate race, said Americans had \u201cjust witnessed the most egregious example of election interference and an outright mockery of the rule of law in the 246-year history of our Republic. This entire process right down to the verdict itself has been nothing but a shameful political stunt.\u201d \u201cThis is a terrible day for America and for trust in our justice system,\u201d said\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0Republican Dave McCormick, who is challenging Democratic Sen.

The process played out, and we should always demand accountability from our elected leaders,\u201d Gallego\u00a0said on\u00a0social media.

{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt", "text": "Have you ever heard something on the news and responded by saying \u201cit\u2019s about darn time?\u201d That\u2019s how I felt when I heard about the integration of Negro League Baseball (NLB) statistics from 1920-1948 into Major League Baseball\u2019s (MLB) record books. This move doesn\u2019t somehow \u201cerase the years of injustice,\u201d as the documentary \u201cWhen It Was A Game\u201d put it. Rather, including NLB statistics in the MLB ones \u201cserve[s] to remind us of what we missed\u201d by having racially segregated leagues. Indeed, as elite sportswriter Neil Paine pointed out to me, it\u2019s the stats that show us that the NLB was the equal of, if not superior to, its White counterpart. Consider the statistics of when nine White major leaguers from various teams \u2013 who came together under the banner of \u201call-star\u201d teams \u2013 played against teams of Black major leaguers. The NLB players won 51% of the time from 1900 to 1948. This isn\u2019t some statistical fluke, either. We have 180 documented games during this stretch, which is the equivalent of over one season of major league games (162 currently) or more than 25 World Series taken to the maximum of seven games. As Negro League historian Todd Peterson noted when he made his case a few years ago, the Negro Leaguers were the only ones to consistently beat White major leaguers, who dominated squads of semi-pro, college and minor leaguers. The games between White MLB stars and NLB players left a lasting mark on Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean, who had organized a lot of games between White \u201call-stars\u201d and Negro League players. Dean had great respect for the skills of arguably the Negro League\u2019s best pitcher, Satchel Paige, after Dean\u2019s team of White ball players fell to NLB teams on numerous occasions. While players like Paige eventually did join an integrated MLB, he was well past his prime. Fortunately, we got to see other NLB players join an integrated MLB a short time into their careers. Willie Mays was the best player of the second half of the 20th century, according to the all-encompassing stat wins above replacement (WAR); Mays was a member of NLB\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons in 1948. Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron was the second-best player, according to WAR, of the second half of the 20th century. The 20th century home run king was a member of the NLB\u2019s Indianapolis Clowns in 1952, after the period where NLB teams were considered major league for stat counting purposes. High-level players and deserved accolades It\u2019s depressing to imagine a world where Mays or Aaron didn\u2019t play in the integrated major leagues, which is true for Black players overall. They quickly became an integral part of the American and National Leagues in the late 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s. Black players were on average the best players, which adds to the case that the NLB was a major league. Former NLB players who joined the integrated MLB got on base more frequently (.361) than the average (.324). They hit for more power too with a higher slugging percentage (.455) than the average (.380). The same dominance of former NLB players held true for pitching in the integrated MLB. They won more games (55%) than the average major leaguer (50%), gave up fewer runs (with an ERA of 3.76 vs. 3.91) and struck out more players per nine innings (5.91 vs. 4.89). It\u2019s not surprising that the second former NLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated major leagues was pitcher Don Newcombe. In fact, former NLB players won the National League Rookie of the Year every year from 1949 to 1953. The first MLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated league was Jackie Robinson. Sometimes lost in all of the deserved accolades of Robinson\u2019s breaking the color barrier in 1947 was just how good he was as a player in the integrated league. He put together seven of the best seasons ever for a guy who primarily played second base, according to WAR. Robinson did this while not playing a single integrated MLB game until he was 28, when many players\u2019 skills are already declining. Players like Robinson and Larry Doby \u2013 the first American League Black player and Hall of Famer \u2013 were able to perform at a high level, despite having to put up with a lot of racist rhetoric from fans and fellow players. Sadly, some NLB stars never got to play in an integrated MLB: catcher Josh Gibson was one of them. He died before Robinson ever took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. With Wednesday\u2019s news, Gibson\u2019s now credited with being the all-time baseball leader in batting average at .372 and power hitting (with a slugging percentage of .718). Gibson also leads in on-base-plus-slugging (OBPS) at 1.177, which combines getting on base and hitting for power. Ty Cobb had led the first category, while Babe Ruth led the second and the third. Gibson\u2019s great grandson put it best when he told CNN that \u201cnow, the conversation begins where Josh Gibson ranks as the greatest of all time or one of the greatest of all time.\u201d It\u2019ll be a fun debate to compare the power hitting of Gibson and Ruth. We\u2019ll never know how Ruth would have batted if Black players were part of the American League, or how Gibson would have done in regular season competition against White players. But what\u2019s interesting about the MLB is that it was already combining records for two totally different leagues prior to adding the NLB to the record books. The American League (of which Doby was part of) and National League (of which Robinson was part of) didn\u2019t play regular season games against each other until 1997. Cobb never played against a NL squad in the regular season. Ruth only did for well less than half a season, after he was well past his prime. In fact, if you were to look at the leaderboard for White MLB stats prior to integration, you\u2019ll see many players never played the opposing league in the regular season. NL pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander never played against the AL. AL pitcher Walter Johnson never played against the NL. A big reason for that is that it was basically impossible for the AL and NL teams to trade players to each other prior to 1959. The leagues were so distinct that they had different presidents just like the NLB. What today\u2019s MLB did in combining the records of the different leagues \u2013 the AL, NL and NLB \u2013 makes sense and has precedent to some degree. When people look at MLB stats now, they\u2019ll get a truer picture of who was good, great or transcendent, regardless of which league they played in.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_irs-direct-file-free", "text": "The Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that it will continue and expand its free tax filing program in 2025. A pilot version of the online program, known as Direct File, launched earlier this year. It provides step-by-step guidance to taxpayers filing their federal tax returns. Direct File was available to people with certain simple tax returns in 12 states during the 2024 tax filing season. More than 140,000 people successfully filed their federal tax returns using Direct File, exceeding the agency\u2019s expectations. Next year, the IRS plans to allow some taxpayers in all states and Washington, DC, to use the program, though not all states may choose to participate. The Biden administration is touting the pilot program \u2013 which was funded by the Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 as a win. The legislation, which passed in 2022, provided the IRS with a massive, 10-year investment meant to modernize taxpayer services and crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Republicans, concerned that small businesses and the middle class could be targeted by IRS auditors, have made several\u00a0efforts to chip away at the agency\u2019s funding. \u201cPresident Biden is committed to saving Americans time and money and ensuring families receive the tax benefits they\u2019re owed,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on a call with reporters Thursday. \u201cAfter a successful pilot, we are making Direct File permanent and inviting all 50 states to offer this free filing option to their residents,\u201d she said. The pilot program has cost nearly $32 million so far. About $75 million has been budgeted for Direct File during fiscal year 2025, though the cost will depend on how many people ultimately use the program. The IRS said it plans to gradually increase the number of taxpayers eligible to use Direct File over the coming years so that it can ultimately support most common tax situations. A government survey found that 90% of Direct File users said their experience with the tax filing system was \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cabove average.\u201d Nearly half of the survey respondents had paid to file their federal tax returns the previous year. How Direct File works Before starting to file a tax return, Direct File prompts taxpayers to answer screening questions that will determine if they are eligible. During the 2024 tax filing season, eligibility was limited to people with simple tax returns. For example, taxpayers with income from an employer reported on a W-2 may have been eligible \u2013 but not if they had other types of income, such as from a side gig or a business. The IRS plans to expand the capability of Direct File next year so that more people with different kinds of tax situations are eligible. But there is no income threshold \u2013 unlike the existing\u00a0Free File Program, which is currently only available to taxpayers who earn $79,000\u00a0or less. That program is provided by an alliance of\u00a0eight different private companies and has historically had\u00a0a low usage rate. Before using Direct File, taxpayers must create an account and verify their identity using\u00a0Id.Me, a digital identity network already used by other federal government programs. The IRS also offers a live-chat function that connects taxpayers with a customer service representative. Direct File does not prepare state tax returns. But taxpayers who are required to file a state return are directed to their state filing system after completing their federal return. IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said Thursday that Direct File will serve as an option for taxpayers and will not be mandatory. Major overhaul at the IRS Direct File is just one of the many changes happening at the IRS after it received the new funding, totaling $80 billion over a decade, from the Inflation Reduction Act. With the funding, the IRS has improved phone service, put a plan in motion to\u00a0digitize all paper-filed tax returns and made improvements to the online tool known as \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund?\u201d so that taxpayers can get more real-time information about the status of their tax returns. The agency also has collected millions of dollars in back taxes by cracking down on millionaires who\u00a0haven\u2019t paid what they owe. Now, the IRS is focused on ramping up audit rates of wealthy taxpayers and large corporations. It expects the audit rate of taxpayers earning more than $10 million to increase by 50%, going up from 11% in 2019 to 16.5% in 2026. Werfel has repeatedly said the agency is committed to shielding American households that earn less than $400,000 a year from an increase in audit rates. Specifically, audit rates of those Americans will not exceed what they were in 2018, a record-low year.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_third-party-president-what-matters", "text": "They booed former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who currently leads in polling in some swing states. They rejected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who is polling at 15% in some polls. Instead, at its convention over the weekend, the Libertarian Party selected a little-known former congressional candidate, Chase Oliver, who is hoping they can get to 2% of the popular vote on Election Day. Turns out that Libertarians are motivated by the ultrasmall-government mindset that leads them to be Libertarians as opposed to an uncomfortable alliance to benefit Trump or help Kennedy get on a debate stage. A match with Kennedy made some sense, at least on paper. Libertarians currently have ballot access in 38 states. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in six, although he promises to be on more by Election Day. But the idea of simply placing Kennedy atop the Libertarian Party ticket to marry his momentum with their organization left Kennedy with an embarrassing loss at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington. Kennedy did not even advance out of the first round of voting. Neither did Trump, who could arguably appeal to some Libertarians with his anti-government rhetoric. After his address, Trump was barred from taking part in the nominating process because his campaign failed to fill out the proper paperwork. Where does Kennedy\u2019s support come from? Kennedy\u2019s politics are unique, melding his history as an environmental crusader, his deeply held belief in conspiracy theories and his notable vaccine skepticism. These views are not necessarily very Libertarian. He is at odds with his own running mate, Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of a Google co-founder and a top benefactor of the campaign. Kennedy and Shanahan disagree on both abortion policy and Middle East policy. Among those who didn\u2019t vote for Biden or Trump in 2020 \u2013 including both those who supported another candidate and those who didn\u2019t vote at all \u2013 Kennedy got the support of 37% in CNN\u2019s poll conducted by SSRS in April. Trump got the backing of 30% of these voters who either opted for a major party alternative or simply didn\u2019t vote. Biden got just 12%. Kennedy may well take more support from Trump than from Biden, but not by a lot, according to a recent analysis by CNN\u2019s Harry Enten (watch it below). As evidence, Enten pointed to Quinnipiac University polling that asked Kennedy supporters who they would support in a two-way matchup. About half \u2013 51% \u2013 said they would support Trump in a two-way matchup, compared with 37% who said they would pick Biden. In a written analysis, Enten points to polling that suggests many of Kennedy\u2019s current supporters are not yet familiar with many of his most notable positions, including on vaccines. Support for third-party candidates has a tendency to flag closer to Election Day. The recent high-water mark is Ross Perot, who got 19% of the vote in 1992. The last third-party candidate to win a state and get Electoral Votes was George Wallace, who won Southern states in 1968. The only third-party candidate to outperform a major party candidate was former President Teddy Roosevelt, who outpolled Republicans after he failed to get their nomination in 1912 and then ran as a third-party candidate. Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, won that election. What are Libertarians aiming for? While Kennedy is polling better than recent third-party or independent candidates, most of them barely register. If Oliver can reach 2% in the popular vote, that would be better than the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in 2020 but still far short of Gary Johnson\u2019s 3.28% of the popular vote in 2016. CNN\u2019s Aaron Pellish was at the Libertarian convention. When I asked him why there was so much opposition to Kennedy and Trump, Pellish sent me these distinct thoughts: First and foremost, Libertarian opposition to Trump and Kennedy starts with fundamental disagreements on policy. Despite both candidates calling for the US to reduce its involvement in foreign conflicts, many Libertarians feel Trump and Kennedy don\u2019t go far enough to prevent wars globally. Many Libertarians also support eliminating the Federal Reserve and oppose the government taxing citizens, extreme measures neither Trump nor Kennedy endorsed in their remarks at the convention.  Several Libertarians I spoke to were frustrated by what they viewed as attempts by both candidates to pander to party members for votes in November.  A few convention attendees linked Kennedy and Trump to Bob Barr, the former GOP congressman who ran as the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2008, and to Bill Weld, the former Republican Massachusetts gov. who ran alongside Gary Johnson as the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Both Barr and Weld left the Libertarian Party after losing their respective elections.  But the memory of past politicians who used the party for their own gain without fully committing to Libertarian values appeared to undergird the resentment some Libertarians held for the two interlopers. The inverse comparison is Ron Paul, who ran for president as a Libertarian in the 1980s but found greater success when he ran as a Libertarian-leaning Republican. Paul did not \u2013 and never was going to \u2013 get the Republican nomination, but he made a calculated decision that he could more effectively influence the policy conversation from within a major party. Now Kennedy\u2019s campaign, and the super PAC that supports it, will have to continue the slog of getting on ballots in enough states to make a mark on the election. The Green Party is the only third party that is consistently on the ballot in all 50 states. It will not officially select a nominee until July. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2012 and 2016, is seen as a likely bet. The best recent election for the Green Party came in 2000, when Ralph Nader won more than 2% of the vote and arguably kept Al Gore, the Democrat, from winning Florida and the presidency. Less than 2% can sway an election The Republican consultant who orchestrated George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns, Karl Rove, notes in The Wall Street Journal that the Green Party candidate in 2016, Stein, got more votes than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He concludes Stein arguably cost the Democratic ticket, led by Hillary Clinton, the election. The same thing may have happened in 2020, Rove argues, when the Libertarian\u2019s Jorgensen got less than 2% of the national vote but exceeded Biden\u2019s margin of victory in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. Those stats are true, but Rove\u2019s assessment may be flawed. Johnson, the Libertarian candidate in 2016, outperformed Stein in each of those states Rove mentioned. Trump won anyway. The election reform advocacy group FairVote has compiled data on recent third-party candidates here. But rather than focus on the relatively few people who turn out for a third-party candidate, why not look at the large number of people who don\u2019t take part in elections at all? The 2020 presidential election won by Biden had the highest turnout of any presidential election since 1900. But only about two-thirds \u2013 66% \u2013 of eligible voters turned out to vote, according to an analysis by Pew Research Center, although turnout was higher in some states than others.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/third-party-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_trump-apprentice-producer-black-contestant", "text": "A producer for \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d is claiming that former President Donald Trump used the N-word during the show\u2019s filming \u2014 and it was recorded on camera. Bill Pruitt, a former show producer, wrote in a piece published Thursday by Slate that Trump used the word to describe Kwame Jackson, a Black finalist on the first season of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which aired in 2004. Pruitt wrote that he was one of four producers involved in the show\u2019s first two seasons \u2014 and that he signed a nondisclosure agreement carrying a potential fine of $5 million that he says expired this year. His claim repeats an allegation that has circulated for years. Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant and Trump White House aide, claimed in 2018, as she was promoting her book, that she\u2019d heard a tape of Trump using the racist term. CNN has not independently confirmed the existence of the tape. Responding to the allegation at the time, Trump tweeted,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t have that word in my vocabulary, and never have.\u201d Pruitt wrote that Trump used the word while discussing, on camera, Jackson\u2019s performance, including his handling of Manigault Newman, with showrunner Jay Bienstock, Trump employee Carolyn Kepcher and other producers, including Pruitt. The conversation was focused on who would win the show\u2019s first season. Pruitt wrote: \u201c\u2018Yeah,\u2019 he says to no one in particular, \u2018but, I mean, would America buy a n\u2014 winning?\u2019\u201d He added that Trump \u201cis serious, and he is adamant about not hiring Jackson.\u201d Jackson would ultimately lose \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to fellow contestant Bill Rancic. Pruitt wrote, \u201cAfterward, we film the final meeting in the boardroom, where Jackson and Rancic are scrutinized by Trump, who, we already know, favors Rancic. Then we wrap production, pack up, and head home. There is no discussion about what Trump said in the boardroom, about how the damning evidence was caught on tape. Nothing happens.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign flatly denied Pruitt\u2019s claims. \u201cThis is a completely fabricated and bullshit story that was already peddled in 2016,\u201d\u00a0Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. \u201cNobody took it seriously then, and they won\u2019t now, because it\u2019s fake news. Now that Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrats are losing the election, they are bringing up old fake stories from the past because they are desperate.\u201d Pruitt also described Trump commenting on female camera operators\u2019 looks. He ordered one woman off an elevator on which she was about to film Trump because he said out loud that\u00a0she was \u201ctoo heavy,\u201d Pruitt wrote, and compared another\u2019s looks to his daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s. \u201cThere\u2019s a beautiful woman behind that camera,\u201d Trump said, according to Pruitt. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want to look at.\u201d Pruitt described the show as a \u201clong con\u201d built around Trump\u2019s confidence. He wrote that the show elevated Trump \u201cfrom sleazy New York tabloid hustler to respectable household name.\u201d \u201cIn the show, he appeared to demonstrate impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth, even though his businesses had barely survived multiple bankruptcies and faced yet another when he was cast,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy carefully misleading viewers about Trump \u2013 his wealth, his stature, his character, and his intent \u2013 the competition reality show set about an American fraud that would balloon beyond its creators\u2019 wildest imaginations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/trump-apprentice-producer-black-contestant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_turnout-2024-election-analysis", "text": "For decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024. A wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote. These new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_senators-letter-fentanyl-cryptocurrency", "text": "A bipartisan pair of US senators is pressuring the Biden administration to do more to crack down on how drug cartels use cryptocurrency to traffic fentanyl, a drug that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year. Sens.Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, have asked for information on \u201cspecific actions\u201d the administration has taken regarding crypto\u2019s role in the fentanyl trade and what metrics the administration uses to measure success in a new letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0and White House obtained by CNN. The letter reflects growing anxiety in Congress about the fentanyl crisis and the ease with which Mexico\u2019s most dangerous drug cartels can cheaply buy ingredients online to make the synthetic opioid. A CNN investigation published in August examined the increasing use of cryptocurrency in the fentanyl trade and efforts by the DEA and other agencies to try to catch up to the threat in their investigations. Those efforts included federal agents poring over notes that drug traffickers left in stash houses and tracing crypto payments to accounts allegedly used by the cartels. Cryptocurrency transactions for fentanyl ingredients surged 450% in the year through April 2023, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from private crypto-tracking analysis firm Elliptic. The Biden administration has in the last year announced multiple initiatives involving\u00a0law enforcement, intelligence gathering and anti-money laundering capabilities across the federal bureaucracy to track and intercept fentanyl proceeds. But now, Warren and Cassidy want to know what progress those initiatives are making, any roadblocks the administration is facing and what Congress can do to help. The senators expressed their \u201congoing concerns\u201d about how cryptocurrency helps fuel the deadly fentanyl trade. \u201cWhat statutory limits do you currently face?\u00a0Do you have any specific recommendations for Congress to address this problem?\u201d the lawmakers wrote in the letter to DEA Administrator Anne Milgram and Rahul Gupta, the head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. CNN has requested comment from the White House and the DEA on the letter. Fentanyl continues to be an extremely delicate diplomatic issue in US relations with Mexico and China. Most of the fentanyl that enters the US comes from ingredients made in China that are then pressed into pills \u2013 or packed in powder \u2013 and smuggled in from Mexico by drug cartels, according to the DEA. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen led a delegation to Beijing last month where she touted a new \u201cworking group\u201d through which US and Chinese officials can discuss money laundering concerns, including those related to fentanyl. William Kimbell, the DEA\u2019s chief of operations, told a Senate hearing last month that his agency needed more cooperation from their Chinese counterparts. \u201cWe would like to see more cooperation from the Chinese where they\u2019re actually sharing intelligence with us when they identify people in their own country that are breaking their money laundering laws \u2026 so we can get a bigger picture of exactly the events that are transpiring,\u201d Kimbell said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/senators-letter-fentanyl-cryptocurrency/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The Chinese man, YunHe Wang, is accused of helping assemble a vast network of infected computers, known as a botnet, that was used to carry out bomb threats, send child exploitation materials online and conduct financial fraud, among other schemes,\u00a0the department\u00a0alleges. Fraudsters used the botnet to submit tens of thousands of fake applications for federal relief\u00a0during\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic, leading to losses of about $5.9 billion,\u00a0according to statements from the Departments of Justice and Treasury. The alleged cybercriminal conduct and the lavish lifestyle it funded \u201creads like it\u2019s ripped from a screenplay,\u201d Matthew Axelrod, a senior US Commerce Department official involved in the investigation, said in a statement. Law enforcement agents seized about $4 million worth of watches, sports cars and other luxury assets, including a Ferrari and Rolls-Royce, and $30 million in real estate properties across East Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and the US, Brett Leatherman, a senior FBI official, told reporters.\u00a0Wang used money he earned from renting the botnet to buy property in those locations, according to an indictment unsealed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Authorities in Singapore and Thailand worked with the FBI on the bust, the Justice Department said. Court records did not list an attorney for Wang. Leatherman said the US government was pursuing his extradition to the US and that an investigation into other potential suspects was ongoing. Wang and other alleged members of the criminal network used virtual private networking (VPN) to spread their malicious code, infecting 19 million different IP addresses worldwide, including over 600,000 in the US, according to prosecutors. IP addresses are the unique numbers that correspond to individual devices on the internet. The new charges\u00a0are only the latest\u00a0alleged\u00a0example of\u00a0opportunistic fraud\u00a0that has been rampant across the US since\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0emerged more than four years ago. Fraudsters pounced\u00a0on opportunities to exploit\u00a0the more than $2 trillion federal economic stimulus package known as the CARES Act, a 2020 law that the botnet allegedly\u00a0targeted. The problem got so bad that the Secret Service\u00a0named\u00a0a senior official as National Pandemic Fraud Recovery Coordinator to try to claw back some of the many billions that were stolen.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_takeaways-trump-jury-deliberations", "text": "The jury in Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial finished its first day of deliberations Wednesday without reaching a verdict after meeting for more than four-and-a-half hours. Jurors will return on Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. ET to resume deliberations, but the 12 men and women will also again hear from Judge Juan Merchan. Wednesday afternoon, the jury asked to hear a readback of four separate parts of witness testimony, including from former National Enquirer chief David Pecker and Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen. Jurors also want to re-hear Merchan\u2019s instructions on the law that he had given them earlier Wednesday morning. The jurors requested four pieces of testimony: Pecker\u2019s testimony about his phone conversation with Trump in June 2016, his testimony about not finalizing Trump\u2019s payment to AMI for Karen McDougal\u2019s life rights, his testimony about the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting, and Cohen\u2019s testimony about the Trump Tower meeting. The testimony the jurors are requesting relates to interactions Trump had directly with Pecker. The testimony from Cohen and Pecker about the 2015 meeting concerns the meeting where Pecker agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the campaign, while Pecker testified in his call with Trump in June 2016 that he discussed the McDougal story and whether Trump should buy it. The jury will ultimately decide whether a former president is convicted of felony crimes for the first time in American history \u2013 at the same time that Trump is running against President Joe Biden for president this November. Judge\u2019s instructions The political implications of the case were not overtly at issue on Wednesday morning as Merchan spent an hour instructing the jury on the law. He explained the 34 felony counts against Trump for falsifying business records over the reimbursement to Cohen for hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, going over the elements of the crime that jurors must decide prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt to return a guilty verdict. Merchan also reminded jurors they must put aside their biases as they decide the defendant\u2019s fate. \u201cRemember, you have promised to be a fair juror,\u201d the judge said. \u201cA fair juror is a person who will keep their promise to be fair and impartial and who will not permit the verdict to be influenced by a bias or prejudice in favor of or against a person who appeared in this trial.\u201d Merchan has asked the jury to clarify Thursday morning whether they wanted the entire, hourlong presentation to be read back, or if there were just portions of it that they needed to hear one more time. The jury was not given a written copy of Merchan\u2019s charging instructions, something CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said is a problem. While most federal judges will send the actual document with the jury as it deliberates, New York state courts forbid this practice. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that New York State courts do it,\u201d Honig said. \u201cThey are obstinate, they are stuck in the past, they are making life difficult for the jury.\u201d While the deliberations are ongoing, Trump and his attorneys are remaining in the courthouse in downtown Manhattan, so they can be ready if the jury returns any additional notes, which could be questions or requests like the one Wednesday afternoon to re-hear testimony. The jurors were also given a laptop that had all of the evidence in the trial, so they could consult it while they deliberate. The judge said the laptop does not have internet access. Meanwhile, the six alternate jurors aren\u2019t yet off the hook. They\u2019ve been asked to come back in the event one of them needs to replace one of the 12 jurors in case they are unable to serve.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/takeaways-trump-jury-deliberations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_trump-vp-dark-horse", "text": "In recent weeks, an increasingly familiar list of Republicans has dominated the not-very-subtle competition to become Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Trump himself has added to the air of inevitability by floating these names in interviews and appearances over and over. But there\u2019s a steady drumbeat of speculation within Trump\u2019s orbit that the former president\u2019s flair for\u00a0the dramatic will at some point take over. Many around the campaign believe the lack of secrecy surrounding the open audition\u00a0raises the possibility Trump ultimately picks someone off the public\u2019s radar. \u201cHistorically, the more he says a name, the less likely it is to be that person,\u201d one adviser told CNN, but noted that they too were speculating. Trump has batted around the same names for months and many of them have spent their recent weeks making public demonstrations of their loyalty, appearing outside the Manhattan courthouse where Trump is on trial or defending him on television. When asked about his potential options in an interview last week, Trump responded, \u201cWe have so many, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d before rattling off several names frequently mentioned as likely contenders: former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Sen. J.D.\u00a0Vance and Rep. Elise Stefanik. \u201cBut I could go on for quite a long time,\u201d he added. Trump has also routinely asked allies their thoughts on Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, both of whom have appeared at recent campaign rallies and regularly defend the former president on cable news. Still, a decision is unlikely until right before or at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July,\u00a0as Trump and his team try to build anticipation surrounding an announcement to maximize the political impact of the selection. Against that backdrop, the list of names under consideration seems to be growing, not shrinking. Trump\u2019s openness to feedback from donors, allies and advisers has also left room for those in his orbit to pitch their top choices to the former president and the media alike. In recent weeks, that has included new consideration for Florida Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill\u00a0Hagerty\u00a0of Tennessee,\u00a0former Hawaii Rep.\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard and even former South Carolina\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley. Within Trump\u2019s orbit, a growing number of influential voices have encouraged the former president to consider\u00a0picking a running mate who is Hispanic. The search for a potential bilingual running mate who could help make in-roads with a critical voting bloc has often centered on Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants who regularly defends Trump in English and Spanish. But two sources with knowledge of these conversations said Salazar\u2019s name has circulated as well. Salazar, a respected television journalist for Univision before\u00a0winning a seat in Congress in 2020, provided a fierce defense of the former president while attending his hush money trial in New York. Salazar likened the legal case against Trump to the political prosecution remembered by the residents of her district, many of Cuban and Venezuelan decent. \u201cI am here of my own volition, I am not on the list of the favorites, I am not looking for a job and I paid for my own way,\u201d Salazar said outside the Manhattan courthouse, before echoing Trump\u2019s claims of political persecution. \u201cThousands of my constituents back in Miami are terrified when the courts in this country are used as weapons to crush our political enemies.\u201d Salazar and Trump interacted at Mar-a-Lago in recent months, a source familiar with their relationship told CNN. Salazar and her husband, Lester Woerner, a wealthy businessman based in Palm Beach, are friendly with members of the Trump family, the source added. Still, Salazar\u2019s relative inexperience would make her a bold, if not unlikely, dark horse to be first in line to the presidency. Salazar also faces the same\u00a0potential Florida residency\u00a0hurdle as Rubio.\u00a0While there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0Article II of the Constitution prevents electors\u00a0from voting for two people from the same state. The rule would be even more relevant in a close election, and the Trump campaign currently predicts that the 2024 race will be close, according to conversations with multiple Trump advisers. Cotton would bring more than a decade of Washington experience to the ticket \u2013 serving one term in the US House before being elected to the US Senate in 2014 \u2013 as well as a military background. Unlike his Senate colleagues who are regularly asked about running alongside Trump, Cotton had flown under the radar until The New York Times last week reported he had emerged as an unexpected contender for the job. A source confirmed Trump floated Cotton\u2019s name during a recent private dinner, surprising some of his guests. The source, though, also walked away from the interaction believing Trump is not close to landing on a running mate and isn\u2019t yet having serious conversations with his team to narrow the potential field of candidates. \u201cThis is all still in Trump\u2019s mind,\u201d the person said. Another source explained the interest in Cotton as stemming from Trump\u2019s willingness to hear from outside voices \u2013 in this case, allies of Cotton hoping to pique Trump\u2019s interest in the senator. One source in Trump\u2019s orbit insisted that Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate,\u00a0remains under consideration. After the two met, Trump had indicated a strong affinity for Gabbard and her party switch has made her an intriguing surrogate to the former president. But she faces an uphill climb after voting to impeach Trump while in Congress \u2013 a fact he was recently reminded of by his aides, sources close to him said. Another name that\u2019s been floated privately is Tennessee\u2019s Hagerty. At a recent fundraiser in New York hosted by billionaire Howard Lutnick,\u00a0Hagerty\u00a0attended as a special guest alongside most of the Republicans regularly mentioned as top-tier veepstakes contenders. Doug Kaplan, president of Kaplan Strategies, released a poll in April on how potential running mates would fare with Trump in four swing states vs.\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden and\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris. Hagerty was included in the poll (though his name was misspelled with two G\u2019s) along with\u00a0Florida\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis,\u00a0South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem,\u00a0Carson, Rubio\u00a0and\u00a0Vance. Kaplan told CNN he included Hagerty because he was \u201ctrying to think outside the box.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have great name recognition,\u201d Kaplan said. But he added Hagerty is \u201csomeone Trump respects on foreign policy\u201d and is \u201cone of those do no harm guys.\u201d Others said they had only heard Hagerty\u2019s name floated for roles in a potential Trump administration including national security adviser and secretary of state. Hagerty previously served as ambassador to Japan under Trump. Earlier this year, Hagerty was spotted at Trump International Golf Club\u00a0in West Palm Beach with\u00a0the former president. A source close to Trump called it \u201csimply two friends having lunch.\u201d Some Republicans have privately \u2013 and even publicly \u2013 pitched Trump to assemble a team of rivals that would include Haley as his running mate. Despite having dropped out of the race months ago, Haley has continued to win a significant share of the vote in primary contests, including nearly\u00a017% of the vote last month in Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground. She also won about 22% of the vote in Indiana\u2019s primary earlier this month, a surprising result in a traditionally red state. Trump himself has referred to Haley as \u201ctough\u201d and told one person recently that she put up a good fight during the contentious fight for the Republican nomination. Haley extended an olive branch last week when she said she would vote for the former president in her first public remarks since ending her own White House bid.\u00a0Still,\u00a0despite Trump\u2019s welcoming her support and indicating she could play a part in the campaign, the two have yet to speak. Republican Rep. Ralph\u00a0Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed\u00a0Haley\u00a0in the primary before switching his support to\u00a0Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket \u2014an argument he made to both Republicans. \u201cFor Nikki\u00a0Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d\u00a0Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President\u00a0Trump\u00a0and also to Nikki\u00a0Haley.\u201d Norman said that while\u00a0Haley\u00a0has not expressed interest in joining\u00a0Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would consider it. \u201cPolitics is an interesting game,\u201d\u00a0Norman said. \u201cPeople can forget the past and look forward to the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/trump-vp-dark-horse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-closing-arguments-trial-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial has arrived at its dramatic final act with lawyers for both sides primed on Tuesday to hammer home their cases before jurors consider a verdict that could make history. The summations mark the climax of a trial that started more than a month ago. They are expected to last all day Tuesday and could stretch into the following day. After Judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law, Trump and the rest of the country will be held in suspense to see whether he will become the first ex-president and presumptive GOP nominee to be convicted of a crime after allegedly falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. The verdict will reverberate far beyond the courtroom and Trump\u2019s personal life since the case has become intertwined with his bid to reclaim the White House. The stakes are especially high since this is likely to be the only one of four pending criminal trials expected to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The former president appeared to be in a bitter mood on the eve of his return to the courtroom, lashing out at opponents he called \u201cHuman Scum\u201d in a message on social media marking Memorial Day. Trump\u2019s defense team is trying to spare their client the ignominy of a conviction that would stain his reputation. The ex-president\u2019s lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, is expected to zero in on the credibility of Trump\u2019s former fixer-turned-nemesis, Michael Cohen, who endured a bruising cross-examination, and to ask why other key figures in the ex-president\u2019s business and personal orbit were not called by prosecutors, CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell reported. Joshua Steinglass, who is conducting closing arguments for the prosecution, will follow Blanche and is expected to spend several hours taking the jury through text messages, phone logs, other witnesses\u2019 testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen\u2019s testimony. Ultimately, the team working for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will try to convince seven men and five women jurors that Trump orchestrated a scheme to keep unflattering information from voters in what was an early example of election interference. Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers do not have to convince all of the jury that he is innocent \u2014 they need only one juror to stand firm against the unanimous guilty verdict required to convict. Their conduct of the trial, in which they produced only two witnesses in a brief defense, signals they will argue that the state of New York has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ex-president ordered and carried out a scheme, which, in any case, they say doesn\u2019t amount to breaking the law. They argued during the trial that there was no evidence of criminal intent. And they will seek to leave jurors with a devastating final picture of Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and was benefiting financially from a growing media empire targeting his ex-boss. While there is a big difference with a hung jury that could force the judge to declare a mistrial, leaving an opening for prosecutors to try Trump again, any outcome that doesn\u2019t end in a conviction could serve Trump\u2019s political purposes, at least for now. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the voting public sees much of a difference between the two. For many, including the defendant, the only relevant question is whether he is a convicted felon or not,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams. \u201cSo, I\u2019d assume the defense is really just hoping to plant a seed in the head of that one juror who has enough doubts about the\u00a0case and might be stubborn enough not to back down.\u201d Cohen will be at the center of the drama again Blanche argued earlier in the month that Cohen was so conflicted as a witness that the case should not even go to the jury. He told the judge: \u201cHe testified. And he lied under oath. In this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, is a conviction, potentially.\u201d Closing arguments are the stage in a case where lawyers summarize weeks of complex testimony and courtroom theatrics and sketch a narrative designed to shape the deliberations over evidence in the jury room. They are also used to impress upon jurors the huge stakes of a trial \u2014 both the grave reality that a person\u2019s reputation and even liberty is on the line and the importance of upholding the rule of law. The jury in this case must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York state prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records \u2014 which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime \u2014 in this case in relation to the 2016 election. The prosecution is likely to argue that while the defense roughed up Cohen, he was truthful about the key elements of the case, and that his testimony was corroborated in advance by weeks of evidence. Former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Sunday that it was not important how jurors generally viewed Cohen as a person. \u201cWhether you like Michael Cohen, whether you\u2019d want him to date your sister, whether you\u2019d want (him) to be your brother-in-law \u2026 you don\u2019t have to like the guy. This is not a likability contest. (Was he) truthful in that moment in time? Was he honest and credible?\u201d In days of evidence, the prosecution built a brick-by-brick legal edifice to pre-but the attacks on Cohen\u2019s credibility, which everyone knew were coming since the man who described himself as Trump\u2019s former \u201cthug\u201d went to jail for offenses including lying to Congress. \u201cThere were weeks and weeks of testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a conspiracy,\u201d\u00a0prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued in court. That evidence was intended to create a storyline that highlighted Trump\u2019s alleged affair with Daniels, in explicit detail, in order to explain to jurors why he might have wanted to cover it up. They secured testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker to highlight Trump\u2019s history of shutting down embarrassing stories, and they produced evidence from former Trump associates, including ex-White House communications director Hope Hicks, to counter the idea Trump was simply seeking to hide his embarrassment about Daniels from his family and was instead most worried about voters forming an unfavorable impression of him in 2016. Prosecutors also sketched a paper trail to suggest that Cohen was acting on the ex-president\u2019s orders in making a $130,000 payment to Daniels and that Trump was involved in cooking the financial books while serving as president to disguise a reimbursement to his former fixer. Another test of Trump\u2019s brittle self-control Tuesday\u2019s closing arguments will create another personal test for Trump, whose attacks on witnesses previously caused Merchan to warn he could be jailed over further violations of a partial gag order. While staying just inside Merchan\u2019s red line, Trump has continued to fire off daily rhetorical attacks on the judge, prosecutors and the Justice Department, along with false claims that the trial is part of an overarching conspiracy by President Joe Biden to destroy him before Election Day. Trump has raised doubts that the 12 New Yorkers who will judge him in the city where he made his name will give him a fair trial. And he has been aided by a parade of Republican supporters, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up to bolster Trump\u2019s assault on the justice system. Trump\u2019s belligerence would be incredible coming from any defendant, let alone one seeking to reassume his role as titular head and ultimate defender of the Constitution as the 47th president. Just over five months from the election, it\u2019s unclear if or how public opinion that is already polarized around Trump will shift when the verdict is announced. The trial has not gripped the attention of the country as it might have were television cameras allowed in the courtroom. And Trump used his multiple criminal indictments to his political advantage in clearing the Republican nominating field. But some polls suggest a conviction could weigh against him in a tight election with Biden. Past behavior also suggests Trump would use any acquittal or a mistrial caused by a hung jury to claim vindication in all his criminal cases and to fuel the campaign of personal and political vengeance around which he\u2019s promised to build a second presidency. The final arguments will go ahead following an unusual weeklong break in the trial that occurred since Merchan wanted to avoid final arguments and jury instruction being interrupted by the Memorial Day holiday. The time off only seems to have escalated Trump\u2019s fury as one of the defining weeks of his life dawns. \u201cHappy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network that was especially jarring on a day dedicated to fallen members of the military. Trump fulminated against judges who had presided over a massive fraud judgment against him, his firm and his adult sons that was worth nearly half a billion dollars and a defamation suit in which he was ordered to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million. Trump concluded his tirade with the words: \u201cNow for Merchan!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-closing-arguments-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_donald-trump-hush-money-trial-verdict", "text": "A Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records Thursday, an unprecedented and historic verdict that makes Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. Not only is Trump the first former president to be found guilty of a felony, he\u2019s also the first major-party presidential nominee to be convicted of a crime in the midst of a campaign for the White House.\u00a0And if he defeats President Joe Biden in November, he will be the first sitting president in history to be a convicted felon. The verdict in the hush money trial was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. \u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said after leaving the courtroom, slamming the presiding judge and the prosecutor who brought the case. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I\u2019m a very innocent man,\u201d he said as he vowed to continue fighting. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, announced charges against Trump last year and presenting the first indictment of a former president, accusing him of falsifying the repayment of his former lawyer Michael Cohen in order to cover up a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. (Trump has denied the affair.) At a news conference Thursday evening, Bragg acknowledged the historic nature of the case and the conviction. While Trump is a defendant \u201cunlike any other in American history,\u201d the district attorney said the verdict was arrived at \u201cin the same manner as every other case that comes through the courtroom doors\u201d \u2013 \u201cby following the facts and the law and doing so without fear or favor.\u201d \u201cThe 12 everyday jurors vowed to make a decision based on the evidence and the law, and the evidence and the law alone. Their deliberations led them to a unanimous conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant Donald J. Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, to conceal a scheme to corrupt the 2016 election,\u201d he said. Throughout the seven-week trial, the district attorney\u2019s office brought in 20 witnesses to illustrate to jurors how the hush-money payment to Daniels was part of a pattern of payoffs to keep negative stories about Trump out of view before the election, and how Trump was concerned about the impact to the campaign when the payment was made in October 2016. Cohen was the prosecution\u2019s key witness, describing how Trump directed him to pay Daniels and then approved the scheme to repay him in $35,000 monthly installments in 2017, an amount that was \u201cgrossed up\u201d in part to account for taxes Cohen would have to pay. Judge Juan Merchan set Trump\u2019s sentencing date for July 11, 2024, at 10 a.m, just days before the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Moments after Trump was found guilty, Biden said the only way to defeat his GOP rival is at the ballot box, with his campaign stressing the stakes of the 2024 election. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to keep Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X, linking to a fundraising page. His campaign said in a statement that the verdict showed \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater,\u201d Michael Tyler, Biden 2024 campaign communications director, said. \u201cA second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms and fomenting political violence \u2014 and the American people will reject it this November.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign also moved quickly to fundraise off the verdict, casting the case as a \u201cpolitical Witch Hunt trial,\u201d a sentiment the former president\u2019s allies echoed as they rushed to his defense Thursday. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said on X, calling the case \u201ca purely political exercise, not a legal one.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

Trump was smiling and laughing with his attorney, Todd Blanche, as they waited for Judge Juan Merchan to announce the jury was heading home for the day. With Trump and prosecutors assembled, Merchan returned to the bench at 4:13 p.m. ET to let the parties know that he planned to send the jury home for the day in about 15 minutes. The judge left the courtroom, and Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors remained behind to wait for the end of the day. But everything changed when the judge re-entered the courtroom at 4:36 p.m. with a stunning note: The jury had reached a verdict. The jury needed 30 minutes to fill out the forms, leaving Trump and the attorneys sitting in the courtroom until the judge and jury returned. They mostly sat still while waiting, occasionally making small talk amongst themselves. When the judge returned to the bench, he warned the parties and the audience against \u201creactions\u201d or \u201coutbursts of any kind\u201d before the jury entered. The six alternates entered and sat in the first row of the gallery, behind prosecutors. The 12 jurors took their seats in the jury box.\u00a0A clerk prompted the jury foreman with each of the 34 counts. He answered \u201cguilty\u201d 34 times. The attorneys were silent and serious as the verdict was read. Only the sound of feverish typing could be heard from the galley filled with press and several members of the public as the foreman delivered Trump\u2019s fate. Reporters could not initially see Trump\u2019s facial reaction when the first guilty verdict was read \u2013 the courthouse had the video screen off while the foreman read most of the verdict, as the court turned off video whenever jurors were moving. Only toward the end of the verdict reading did the video of the defendant\u2019s table get turned back on, letting the reporters behind Trump in the courtroom and those in the overflow room see the former president. Trump sat stone-faced, with a frown, not visibly reacting to the jury as they finished reading the verdict. The jurors were polled one-by-one to confirm this was their verdict, and Trump turned and craned his neck to the right to look at the jurors. Jurors kept serious faces as they were polled one by one to confirm this was in fact their verdict. They each answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cyes it is.\u201d They walked past the defense to exit the courtroom. None of the 12 panelists appeared to look in Trump\u2019s direction on their way out. Trump\u2019s face was red and he was frowning as he walked out of the courtroom. Trump and his son Eric exchanged an emotional handshake as Trump departed, as Eric patted his father on the back and followed behind him with the rest of Trump\u2019s entourage or advisors and lawyers. Steve Witkoff was the only apparent supporting guest aside from Trump\u2019s son in attendance when the verdict was read.

The chief justice\u2019s letter landed a day after Alito told lawmakers in his own letters that he will not recuse in cases involving the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Alito said that his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, hoisted an upside-down American flag at their Virginia home in January 2021 in response to a neighborhood spat. He said she also raised the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at their New Jersey property last summer. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d Both flags have become associated with supporters of former President Donald Trump and were waved at the Capitol during the riot. Alito said in his own letters Wednesday that he was not aware of their modern political meaning. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen.

The Supreme Court is considering two appeals tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_biden-pledge-progressives-supreme-court-vacancies", "text": "President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden promised Black voters Wednesday that he would appoint progressives to the US Supreme Court if elected to a second term, suggesting he expects vacancies on the high court over the next four years. \u201cThe next president, they\u2019re going to be able to appoint a couple justices, and I\u2019ll be damned \u2014 if in fact we\u2019re able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we\u2019ve always had, tell me that won\u2019t change your life,\u201d he said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia. It was as explicit a warning as Biden could offer about the stakes of the upcoming election, and a clear reminder that some of the nine justices have entered their seventies. Clarence Thomas is 75 and Samuel Alito is 74; both are conservative and appointed by Republican\u00a0presidents.\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor,\u00a0a liberal\u00a0who was nominated by President Barack Obama, turns 70 next month. Retirements of any or all of those justices could provide a key opportunity for either Biden, who has named one\u00a0justice\u00a0to the Supreme Court, or his Republican rival Donald Trump, who named three during his four-year term. The ideological makeup of the court has emerged as one of the defining facets of American political power. The current conservative majority \u2014 made possible by Trump\u2019s three appointments \u2014 overturned in 2022 the nationwide right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade, opening a major front in this year\u2019s election. Gun ownership rights, voter protections and regulatory issues have also come before the panel. Justices rarely signal their intentions to retire before announcing them through the court. And presidents have traditionally tread carefully when speaking publicly about the prospect of retirement-age justices stepping down. At the start of his term, Biden made clear to aides there would be no efforts to pressure Justice Stephen Breyer, then age 83, into retirement, even though many Democrats were eager for the political opening such a vacancy would provide. The hands-off approach was rooted in respect for the\u00a0justice,\u00a0whose confirmation Biden oversaw as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and out of fear an overt pressure campaign might backfire. Liberal groups not affiliated with the White House were more explicit in calls for Breyer to retire. Breyer announced his retirement in January 2022, allowing Biden to fulfill a campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Other presidents have adopted a somewhat similar approach. Trump, through his White House counsel Don McGahn, did not make explicit calls for Justice Anthony Kennedy to retire early in his term. Instead, he consulted the\u00a0justice\u00a0on lower court nominations as a way to cultivate a degree of comfort with the process. Obama is said to have danced around the retirement question with Ruth Bader Ginsburg at a lunch in 2013. Then the court\u2019s oldest member, she did not retire during Obama\u2019s term. She died while still on the bench in 2020, and Trump quickly nominated conservative Amy Coney Barrett to replace her. As he attempts a return to the White House, Trump has made his own\u00a0nominees\u00a0to the court a selling point, and promised additional conservative selections if he were to win. \u201cMany presidents never get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice. I had three. They are gold,\u201d he said at a 2023 speech at the Moms for Liberty summit. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get three or four more.

{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters", "text": "With a holiday weekend happening between the final witness testimony and closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money criminal trial, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to look back at what we\u2019ve just seen. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb were inside the courtroom and an adjacent viewing room for all of the oral arguments \u2013 for all 20 days over the course of a month when the trial was in session. While these are the first criminal trial proceedings against Trump, he also faced a civil fraud trial brought by the New York attorney general and two separate defamation lawsuits brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A judge found Trump liable for fraud for inflating his net worth to get friendly loans, and juries found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defaming Carroll. CNN\u2019s reporters have covered all of the trials. I talked to Herb and del Valle about how they went about getting what happened in court out to the world in almost real time and what people watching on TV might have missed. Portions of those conversations, conducted by phone and email and edited for length, are below: What will you take away from covering this trial? DEL VALLE: This is actually my fourth Trump trial. They\u2019ve all been different. This is the first one where he\u2019s had to be there every second. We saw different versions of him, I would say, at each trial. He didn\u2019t show up to the first E. Jean Carroll trial. He came to some of civil fraud trial for big days. He did briefly get up on the stand, and that was a moment in itself that we didn\u2019t get to see here in the criminal trial. We saw a very angry Trump at the second E. Jean Carroll trial where he walked out of closing, was very emotional and had tension with the judge. Here, it\u2019s almost been interesting how at moments it just felt like a regular trial. That\u2019s never really been the case; we go through two levels of security, we have to wait in line hours before the trial starts, and we\u2019re very much controlled by the security for Trump, and that\u2019s not normal. But at the same time, Trump as a defendant has to sit there every second of the day. There are times where you can forget that you are watching the first former president to be on trial facing criminal charges. It\u2019s a shake yourself kind of moment to see him sit there like any other defendant I\u2019ve seen in that courtroom facing what could be a conviction. How did you cover a trial without cameras in real time for coverage on TV? HERB: Kara, Lauren and I watched every day of the trial unfold from two places: inside the courtroom or in an \u201coverflow\u201d auxiliary courtroom, where the proceedings were played on closed-circuit television. This was a historic trial, of course, and we used a brand-new method of filing updates to try to keep readers and viewers informed of what was happening literally second by second. This was possible because the press corps was allowed to use laptops in court (strictly no recording!), so we frantically took notes and then transmitted what we were seeing in real time to a Slack channel. From there, our editors quickly read our Slacks and added them to\u00a0CNN.com\u2019s live story, as well as to a \u201csidestream\u201d feed that was displayed live on air. The idea was to put readers and viewers in the room as best we could \u2013 our dispatches were sent mostly in single sentences so that we could keep updating as quickly as possible. Between the three of us, we tried to capture every moment, big and small, both in terms of quotes being said by the attorneys and witnesses as well as how others in the courtroom \u2013 mainly Trump \u2013 were reacting to what was happening. What did TV viewers miss? HERB: We tried to use descriptive language to describe what we were seeing and hearing, but words can only go so far to replace audio or video. I think it was often hard to capture the tone of a conversation, particularly when it got contentious. We also couldn\u2019t really convey what the jury was thinking \u2013 reporters were far enough away from the jurors that we could see them taking notes or watching the lawyers and witnesses, but it\u2019s hard to know whether they were truly engaged or how they were taking any given bit of testimony. What could you see of Trump? HERB: We made sure to have at least one person in the courtroom and one in overflow, because they give you two different vantage points. Reporters in the courtroom sat behind Trump \u2013 with a view often blocked by the many officers in the aisles of the gallery. In the overflow room, there was a big-screen TV set up that showed four shots: the prosecutors, the defense table, the judge and the witness. From the overflow room, that gave us a clear view of Trump\u2019s face, meaning we could see whether his eyes were closed (which didn\u2019t mean he was necessarily sleeping!). We could also see when he smirked or smiled at something or was writing and passing notes to his attorneys. From the courtroom, that same TV feed was displayed, but it was on a much smaller screen and farther away \u2013 some reporters had binoculars to try to get a better view. What were the most dramatic moments? During Stormy Daniels\u2019 testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Midway through the trial, Stormy, in vivid detail, describing certain things that were entirely taboo, that we wouldn\u2019t really expect to hear in a courtroom, was certainly, I wouldn\u2019t say dramatic, but it was definitely a moment that became a sideshow. It\u2019s not necessarily directly tied to the allegations or the charges in this case, but hearing her describe this alleged night with Trump in the hotel room, down to the anecdote of her smacking him on the butt with a magazine and his reaction in court, audibly cursing at that moment, was definitely a memory. During Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Then, during Cohen\u2019s testimony, on cross-examination (Trump attorney) Todd Blanche built up into what Blanche clearly thought was a gotcha moment, suggesting that Cohen made up a call keeping Trump informed in the Daniels scheme. Blanche suggested it was actually a call with Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, about a 14-year-old prankster who had been prank calling Cohen \u2026 in that moment, Blanche was flailing his arms, yelling in a high-pitched tone, telling Cohen he made this up. Cohen responded that, well, no, I think we could have talked about both things at the same time, or I believe this is the call. And Blanche told him the jury isn\u2019t here to hear what you believe. They need to know what the facts are. And that was right before a lunch break, and it kind of left energy in the room, and set a tone for the rest of the day. When the judge cleared the courtroom \u2026 HERB: The most dramatic moment I think happened when the jury was out of the room during the testimony of the final witness, Robert Costello. His testimony had been limited by the judge ahead of time, and prosecutors were successfully objecting repeatedly to Trump lawyer Emil Bove\u2019s questions. Costello was visibly annoyed at this, and even uttered \u201cridiculous\u201d while the attorneys were at a sidebar with the judge. When he let out a \u201cjeez\u201d after another objection, Judge Juan Merchan excused the jury to admonish the decorum of the witness, (who is) an attorney and former federal prosecutor. That\u2019s when things really got heated. \u201cAre you staring me down right now?\u201d Merchan said to Costello after dressing him down. \u201cClear the courtroom!\u201d the judge announced, leading to chaos as court officers forced reporters \u2013 and the attorney representing the media \u2013 to leave the courtroom over vigorous objections. DEL VALLE: I\u2019ve been in this courtroom for other trials many times. I have not seen a judge clear the courtroom of press to admonish a witness in a sidebar in such a way. The way Merchan handled that was definitely a surprise. How did Trump interact with the friends and aides whom he had not spoken to in some time and who testified for the prosecution? David Pecker, Trump\u2019s longtime friend who tried to use the National Enquirer to help \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories that could hurt Trump \u2026 DEL VALLE: It felt like by the end, Pecker was maybe trying to send Trump a message. Even though they have not spoken since all of this unraveled in 2018, Pecker made a point of saying really positive things about Trump. How long they\u2019ve known each other and had a really strong relationship. How, even though they haven\u2019t spoken recently, Trump has sent him a hello through other people that he\u2019s run into. He still considers Trump a friend all these years later. By the end there, it felt like Trump was watching him and listening to these words, like, who knows, maybe they could be friends publicly again. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary and White House communications director who has since moved on from Trump\u2019s orbit \u2026 DEL VALLE: It was interesting because she made a point of saying that she was paying for her own attorney. She was not by any means still tied to Trump, but she was actually overcome with emotion when they started the cross-examination. She was so nervous the whole time, but especially when it came to how she might be treated by Trump\u2019s side. I think her candor also caught Trump\u2019s attention, and he was definitely watching her at times \u2013 most of her testimony, actually. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump\u2019s former personal assistant at the White House \u2026 DEL VALLE: The one where it definitely felt like there was a connection \u2013 they exchanged eye contact when she came off the stand \u2013 was Madeleine Westerhout, who cried on the stand, was very emotional about the mistakes she made that led to her exit from the White House. She made clear how apologetic she was and what a great man she felt Trump was. He definitely was paying close attention to her and smiled at her at times, and seemed to give her a nod and a smile and maybe exchanged words with her on her way off the stand. Where were Trump\u2019s many supporters, including high-ranking Republican lawmakers? Was there any indication jurors recognized them? HERB: Both the prosecution and the defense were given the first two rows of seats behind their tables in the well for guests. On the prosecution side, District Attorney Alvin Bragg would sit here whenever he popped into the courtroom. On Trump\u2019s side, this was where the Republican lawmakers and other allies of Trump would sit. Trump aide Boris Epshteyn would often direct traffic and make sure they found their seats. On some days, Trump had so many people attending that a few would get relegated to the back row. As for the jury, it\u2019s hard to say whether they recognized any of the VIP guests. Every time they entered the courtroom, they walked past Trump\u2019s table \u2013 and 99% of the time, all of them looked straight ahead and not at the defendant or his guests. What less dramatic moments stand out? DEL VALLE: With Stormy, it was definitely interesting and we tried to describe it, but she was talking a mile a minute. The court reporter could not keep up at all. The prosecutor and the judge had to stop her several times to ask her to slow down. And at one point later in the day, on her direct examination, she leaned over to the court reporter and smiled at her, and said, \u201cAm I talking slower? Can you get it all?\u201d HERB: One of the things that isn\u2019t obvious if you aren\u2019t watching the proceedings is how collegial the lawyers on the opposing sides can be, even as they are viciously fighting against each other on the case and in rulings to try to help their side. During breaks, Blanche would occasionally jump to the other side of the well to speak with his counterparts, Susan Hoffinger or Joshua Steinglass, and more than a few laughs were shared with whatever it was they were discussing. While the press took up the majority of the seats, there were spaces dedicated to the general public \u2013 and some regulars who showed up every day, either sleeping overnight or, more likely, hiring line sitters who had a lucrative business throughout the trial saving spots in lines outside the courthouse for both media and the general public. My favorite light moment in court may have come when Trump attorney Emil Bove was cross-examining a paralegal for the district attorney\u2019s office, Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, who was testifying to enter into evidence call logs he had analyzed for the case. Bove asked him if putting together call summary charges could be \u201cat times, arguably, tedious work?\u201d \u201cHonestly, I kind of enjoyed it,\u201d Jarmel-Schneider said. The response prompted one of the biggest laughs in the courtroom in the entire trial \u2013 even several jurors were laughing. \u201cI hear that,\u201d Bove said in response. \u201cRespect.\u201d What will stick with you from covering this moment of history? HERB: This has easily been one of the most intense assignments I\u2019ve ever had at CNN. Not only is it historic and unprecedented, but the way we are covering it requires a constant focus throughout every hour of every day of the trial \u2013 and every moment, dramatic or monotonous \u2013 in order to make sure we are conveying it to our readers and viewers quickly and accurately. My hope is that I will be able look back at this unprecedented trial and be able to say we covered the historic moment fast and got it right (which I am not taking for granted until the trial is over!).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/politics/trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_can-trump-still-run-for-president-what-matters", "text": "Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president? Definitely. A further question is more complicated: Could Trump, as a felon, vote for himself? Probably. Starting with the easy question \u2026 Can a convict run for president? The US Constitution lays out just three requirements for presidential candidates. They must: Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That\u2019s not happening any time soon. Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump\u2019s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee. It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said most Class E felony convictions, the least serious type of felony in New York, result in non-prison sentences \u2013 often a combination of probation, fines and community service. As a former president, Trump enjoys lifetime Secret Service protection and he will continue to get protection wherever he is, according to Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service. \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the manner in which the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged,\u201d Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN. There is also precedent for presidential campaigns, albeit unsuccessful ones, being mounted from prison cells. Eugene Debs, the Socialist leader, conducted his 1920 presidential campaign from federal prison in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition. He had encouraged Americans to oppose the draft in World War I. The Supreme Court, in that case, had affirmed his conviction, arguing he was convicted not for opposing the draft but for encouraging people not to comply with it. The decision keeping Debs in jail was written by then-Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes just a few months before Holmes did a famous about-face on free speech that put the US on course for the way we view the First Amendment today. Thomas Doherty, an American studies professor at Brandeis University, wrote last year about Debs, noting that he remained in prison as votes were cast and counted \u2013 he got nearly a million, more than 3% of the vote. Even after the Sedition Act was repealed, Debs was kept in prison. Then-President Woodrow Wilson refused to issue a pardon. Wilson\u2019s successor and Debs\u2019 rival in 1920, Warren G. Harding, later commuted Debs\u2019 sentence in 1921. And now to the more difficult question \u2026 Can a convicted felon vote? It depends. Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Each state makes its own rules. Vermont and Maine allow felons to vote from prison. There has been movement in multiple states toward allowing felons on parole to cast ballots. Trump is now a Florida resident \u2013 and Florida voters, in 2018, overwhelmingly backed a referendum to reenfranchise convicted felons. But Republican lawmakers who control the state\u2019s government first delayed and then qualified the reenfranchisement by requiring that felons must pay all fines and fees associated with their sentence. I talked to Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization that works to help reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people. He predicted Trump will have little problem voting since Florida actually defers to the jurisdiction of a felony conviction as to whether a felon can vote. In New York, after a law passed in 2021, any convicted felon who is not incarcerated is eligible to register to vote. Read more from the Campaign Legal Center. Even if the judge ultimately tried to give Trump prison time, it is highly unlikely that Trump\u2019s right to appeal his conviction would be exhausted before Election Day. If, somehow, Trump was convicted in one of the two federal criminal cases against him before Election Day, that might be another story. The are other problems for many post-incarceration felons in Florida, as CNN has reported previously, although they would not apply to Trump. For starters, there is no clearinghouse of data about what fees are required. It has led to confusion and kept many people from voting. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who are confused about their eligibility, and that\u2019s why we continue to work with the state and the election professionals to fix the system,\u201d Volz told me. \u201cBecause people need to know whether they\u2019re eligible or not on the front end of the process.\u201d Volz said his group is making progress with the state to make it much easier for people to confirm their eligibility.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_what-happens-now-trump-felony", "text": "A New York jury convicting Donald Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records brought the former president\u2019s weekslong trial to a close but ushered in a new phase of the historic case. Now in the unique position of being the first former\u00a0US\u00a0president convicted of a felony, Trump faces the possibility of a prison sentence or probation for his crimes\u00a0stemming\u00a0from a hush money payment scheme he helped facilitate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump \u00a0\u2013 who is known for mounting lengthy appeals of court rulings against him \u2013 is also likely to appeal the conviction, which could significantly delay his sentencing, currently set for July 11. Here\u2019s what to know about the case following Trump\u2019s conviction. When will Trump be sentenced? Judge Juan Merchan has set Trump\u2019s\u00a0sentencing\u00a0for\u00a010 a.m. ET\u00a0on\u00a0July 11. Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or up to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years. For now, the former president will remain out of prison as he awaits his sentencing. Prosecutors did not ask for Trump to post any bond. Can Trump appeal his conviction? Trump has consistently appealed court rulings against him in an effort to delay the proceedings or eventually land his case before a court that may side with him. The New York case is no different. Shortly after Trump was convicted, his attorney Todd Blanche asked Merchan for an acquittal of the charges notwithstanding the guilty verdict. The judge rejected the pro forma request. During the course of the trial, Trump\u2019s legal team took other steps to preserve its right to appeal a potential guilty verdict, looking at rulings from the judge on testimony and evidence. They\u2019re all but certain to mount such an appeal in the coming weeks. Can Trump still be elected president? In short,\u00a0yes. University of California, Los Angeles law professor Richard L. Hasen \u2013 one of the country\u2019s leading experts on election law \u2013 has consistently said that nothing in the US Constitution bars a convicted criminal\u00a0from\u00a0running for the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cLegally, nothing changes with Trump\u2019s status as a candidate,\u201d Hasen wrote in his Election Law Blog on Thursday. \u201cThe Constitution contains only limited qualifications for running for office (being at least 35 years old, a natural born citizen, and at least 14 years a resident of the U.S.),\u201d Hasen continued. Additionally,\u00a0states cannot disqualify Trump from running due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election due to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling earlier this year, Hasen\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cand they cannot add qualifications such as removing convicted felons off the ballot.\u201d Will the conviction cost Trump his right to vote? Though Trump, as a Florida resident, is subject to the state\u2019s draconian rules disenfranchising certain people with felony convictions, he may ultimately\u00a0benefit from how legislators in New York in 2021 made it easier for felons to regain the right to vote. When it comes to the Manhattan guilty verdict just rendered,\u00a0Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida\u00a0in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Florida bans felons from voting until they have completed the full terms of their sentence \u2013 including any supervised release \u2013 and until they have paid any associated fines and fees. That latter requirement was the subject of litigation after Florida\u2019s GOP-led legislature passed legislation that undermined a state constitutional amendment allowing people with felony convictions to regain the right to vote. Florida\u2019s felon voting prohibitions apply to people with out-of-state convictions. However, if a Floridian\u2019s conviction is out of state, Florida defers to that state\u2019s laws for how felon can regain their voting rights. In New York, thanks to a 2021 law, people with felony convictions regain their right to vote once they finish their term of incarceration \u2013 even if they are still subject to parole. That means Trump would only be denied his right to vote in Florida if he is serving a prison sentence for the Manhattan conviction at the time of the election. What does this mean for Trump\u2019s other criminal cases? Trump\u2019s conviction means little for his three other criminal cases, which will continue to proceed as they were prior to him being found guilty in the New York case. Trump\u2019s federal election subversion criminal case has been on hold while the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court considers his claims of presidential immunity. The judge overseeing his classified documents case in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial. And the Georgia election interference case is in legal limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying the effort to get the maritime corridor fully operating. Earlier, four US officials told CNN the pier broke apart in heavy seas. Part of the\u00a0pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies\u00a0transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before\u00a0the\u00a0pier can be used again. The damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier. US troops who were aboard the beached vessels were evacuated on Saturday, Singh said on Wednesday, correcting her assertion on Tuesday that the soldiers were still aboard the vessels. \u201c[O]n May 25, heavy sea states caused four US Army vessels operating in support of the JLOTS pier operations to become beached. Two vessels were beached in Gaza near the base of the pier and two were beached near Ashkelon in Israel,\u201d Singh said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cUS personnel on those vessels were evacuated on Saturday, May 25.\u201d The\u00a0pier,\u00a0which cost\u00a0$320 million,\u00a0had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop\u00a0one week later on May\u00a024,\u00a0two days before part of the pier disconnected.\u00a0It is unclear when shipments will resume. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour. Heavier sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0delayed the deployment of the\u00a0pier\u00a0for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions. The US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza. On Thursday, Vice Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper,\u00a0deputy\u00a0commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric\u00a0tons\u00a0of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations. Daniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID\u2019s Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \u201cthousands and thousands of\u00a0tons\u201d of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable. CNN\u2019s Paul Murphy contributed reporting. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_read-the-jury-instructions-from-judge-juan-merchan-in-the-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "Judge Juan Merchan delivered his instructions to jurors before they began deliberations in former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial. Here\u2019s what Merchan told the jury: \u2022 They must not make a decision based on biases or stereotypes;\u2022 They must set aside personal differences;\u2022 They must not speculate about how long a potential sentence may be or what the punishment might be \u2013 that\u2019s up to the judge;\u2022 They can\u2019t hold it against Trump for not testifying;\u2022 The \u201cpeople must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime.\u201d He reminds the jury it must not rest its verdict on speculation;\u2022 They can consider whether a witness hopes to receive a benefit related to the trial, or if they have an interest in how the case ends;\u2022 They cannot convict Trump on Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony alone because he\u2019s an accomplice, but they can use his evidence if corroborated with other evidence;\u2022 The jury must be unanimous if they find Trump guilty on each count \u2013 on whether he committed the crime personally, acted in concert with others or both;\u2022 They must determine if Trump conspired to promote someone or prevent them from public office by unlawful means;\u2022 They should deliberate with a view toward reaching an agreement, without surrendering individual judgment;\u2022 Jurors\u2019 notes cannot be used in place of evidence;\u2022 The foreperson will deliver the verdict for each count after deliberations are over;\u2022 Jurors must surrender their phones and can only discuss the case when all 12 of them are together. Merchan explained some key laws in the case: On the law applicable to falsifying business records, Merchan told the jury: \u201cYou must find beyond a reasonable doubt first that he solicited, requested, commanded, importuned or intentionally aided that person to engage in that conduct, and second, that he did so with the state of mind required with the commission of the offense.\u201d He also explained what makes a person guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree \u2013 explaining that they must have the intent to defraud \u2013 including the intent to commit another crime or conceal the commission of one. On what constitutes a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act: It is unlawful for an individual to willfully make a contribution to any candidate running for office, including the presidency, exceeding certain limits which in the relevant years was $2,700, Merchan tells the jury. He also walked the jury through what they must find in the different counts levelled against Trump. Merchan explained what tax law violations were and said it was unlawful for a person to willfully produce a tax statement or document that\u2019s false. Read the full jury instructions here.

{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_fact-check-trump-false-claims-trial", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has uttered multiple false or misleading claims about his Manhattan criminal trial this week as the trial has neared a conclusion. Here is a fact check of some of the statements Trump has made on social media and to reporters from Tuesday to Thursday morning. Merchan and the \u2018advice of counsel\u2019  After\u00a0closing arguments Tuesday, Trump\u00a0posted on social media to repeat his misleading complaint that Judge Juan Merchan has prevented him from employing a certain defense. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his platform Truth Social: \u201cTHE GREATEST CASE I\u2019VE EVER SEEN FOR RELIANCE ON COUNSEL, AND JUDGE MERCHAN WILL NOT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, LET ME USE THAT AS A DEFENSE IN THIS RIGGED TRIAL. ANOTHER TERM, ADVICE OF COUNSEL DEFENSE!\u201d\u00a0He added in another post on Wednesday morning: \u201cRELIANCE ON COUNSEL (ADVISE OF COUNSEL) NOT ALLOWED BY MERCHAN, A FIRST.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim\u00a0remains\u00a0misleading. He didn\u2019t mention,\u00a0again, that\u00a0the reason Merchan will not allow Trump\u2019s legal team to invoke \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d during the trial is that, when Trump was asked before the trial whether he would be using an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense,\u00a0his lawyers\u00a0told Merchan he would not. An \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense\u00a0typically requires\u00a0the defendant to waive attorney-client privilege. Trump\u2019s lawyers told Merchan before the trial that instead of a \u201cformal\u201d defense of \u201cadvice of counsel,\u201d Trump wanted to use a different defense in which he would not waive attorney-client privilege but\u00a0would\u00a0still\u00a0\u201celicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges in the Indictment.\u201d Merchan rejected this proposal. He\u00a0wrote in March:\u00a0\u201cTo allow said defense in this matter would effectively permit Defendant to invoke the very defense he has declared he will not rely upon, without the concomitant obligations that come with it. The result would undoubtedly be to confuse and mislead the jury. This Court can not endorse such a tactic.\u201d\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0Merchan ruled, Trump could not invoke or even suggest a \u201cpresence of counsel\u201d defense in the trial. Last week, during courtroom discussions about Merchan\u2019s instructions to the jury, Merchan\u00a0rejected\u00a0an attempt by Trump\u2019s defense to invoke the\u00a0\u201cinvolvement of counsel.\u201d Merchan noted he had already made his stance on the proposal clear. Merchan said: \u201cThis is an argument that you\u2019ve been advancing for many, many, many, months. This is something you\u2019ve been trying to get through to the jury for many, many, many months. It\u2019s denied, it\u2019s not going to happen, please don\u2019t raise it again.\u201d Merchan and jury unanimity Trump claimed Wednesday that Merchan \u201cis not requiring a unanimous decision on the fake charges against me.\u201d Trump made the claim in a\u00a0social media post\u00a0in which he described Merchan\u2019s supposed position as \u201cRIDICULOUS, UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND UNAMERICAN.\u201d He was echoing assertions that had been\u00a0circulating among conservatives\u00a0after Fox News anchor John Roberts\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media earlier on Wednesday that \u201cJudge Merchan just told the jury that they do not need unanimity to convict.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim inaccurately depicts what Merchan said.  Merchan\u00a0told the jury in his instructions on Wednesday\u00a0that their verdict \u201cmust be unanimous\u201d on each of the 34 counts that Trump faces and that, to convict Trump of felony falsification of business records, they have to unanimously agree that he falsified business records with the intent to commit, aid or conceal another crime \u2013 that other crime being a violation of a New York election law. But Merchan explained that while\u00a0this New York election law\u00a0prohibits people from conspiring to use \u201cunlawful means\u201d to promote a candidate\u2019s election, jurors don\u2019t have to unanimously agree on which particular \u201cunlawful means\u201d Trump may have used; they can find him guilty as long as they unanimously agree that Trump used some unlawful means.\u00a0Prosecutors provided three theories of what unlawful means Trump used. Merchan told the jury: \u201cAlthough you must conclude unanimously that the defendant conspired to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means, you need not be unanimous as to what those unlawful means were. In determining whether the defendant conspired to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful means, you may consider the following: one, violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act otherwise known as FECA; two, the falsification of other business records; or three, violation of tax laws.\u201d Lee Kovarsky, a University of Texas law professor who has been following the trial,\u00a0put it this way\u00a0on social media on Wednesday: \u201cIf a law says NO VEHICLES IN THE PARK & list of vehicles includes mopeds and motorcycles, all the instruction means is that you need unanimous conclusion of vehicle but not unanimous on whether vehicle was moped or harley.\u201d - CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb contributed to this item. The charges against Trump  After Merchan recited his instructions to the jury on Wednesday, Trump wrote on social media: \u201cI DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CHARGES ARE IN THIS RIGGED CASE\u2014I AM ENTITLED TO SPECIFICITY JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE.THERE IS NO CRIME!\u201d Facts First: This needs context. Less than two hours before Trump made this post claiming he doesn\u2019t even know what the charges are, Merchan had explained each of the 34 charges during his jury instructions\u00a0in the courtroom \u2013 with Trump present.\u00a0 We can\u2019t definitively fact-check what Trump actually knows about the charges, and even some legal analysts have said this case can be a difficult one to understand.\u00a0But there is no basis for any suggestion that the charges have not been specified. Merchan had told the jury, \u201cI will now instruct you on the law applicable to the charged offenses. That offense is Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree \u2013 34 Counts.\u201d He then explained how the crime of first-degree falsifying business records is defined in New York law, further explained the definitions of particular words in that law, and then, one by one, identified each of the 34 business records that make up the 34 counts. The 34 counts were also specified in Trump\u2019s indictment in the case\u00a0more than a year ago. The judge and a possible witness  Trump claimed to reporters on Wednesday that Merchan had refused to allow Trump\u2019s defense to call a leading election-law expert to testify. \u201cThis judge didn\u2019t even let us use the number-one election attorney,\u201d Trump said. He continued moments later, \u201cWe had the leading election expert in the country, Brad Smith, ready to testify. Wouldn\u2019t let him do it.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Merchan did not prohibit this potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. He decided in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith wrote on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump could argue that Merchan\u2019s decision to restrict Smith\u2019s testimony rendered Smith useless as a witness. But his assertion that Merchan flat-out banned Smith from testifying is not true. Biden and the case After the jury began deliberations on Wednesday, Trump spoke repeated his frequent claim that this case was \u201call done by Joe Biden.\u201d And on Thursday morning, he claimed that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had revived the case during Trump\u2019s campaign \u201cat the request of Biden.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that Biden had any role in launching or running Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0-\u00a0and Bragg is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "politics"}}
