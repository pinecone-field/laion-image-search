{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_biden-rising-tide-pressure-reelection-bid-analysis", "text": "No president has ever needed a public holiday like Joe Biden needs July 4. Biden is battling frantically to save his political career by escalating defiance. But he\u2019s in danger of being swamped by a rising tide against him as more Democrats express doubts that he can beat Donald Trump after a disastrous debate performance. The president will gather family members who will be critical to his future deliberations on his reelection campaign at the White House for Independence Day \u2014 in sore need of a slow news day that would allow him to regroup for potentially the most critical 48 hours of his political career. As speculation exploded Wednesday that he may be considering pulling out of the race, Biden unequivocally declared that he was in it to win. He then met 20 Democratic governors at the White House to try to prove he has the energy and acuity to win and lead for four more years. On Friday, Biden will sit for an interview with ABC News that\u2019s now shaping up as an even greater challenge than the CNN debate, given his need to put in a nimble and forceful corrective performance. Biden\u2019s swing state campaign stops will, like his every single public appearance now, be parsed for any slip-up or sign of vulnerability that supports the impression that Biden created for himself on the debate stage of a diminished commander in chief. \u201cI am running. I\u2019m the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one\u2019s pushing me out. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Biden declared to spooked campaign staff on a phone call on Wednesday as he searched for an elusive comeback. Now, it\u2019s jet lag that was the problem But the tough emerging reality for the president is that the assurances, shifting explanations and spin that his political aides have come up with so far are not working \u2014 because there may be no answer to his predicament. The image of an incoherent, weak and struggling president was seared on the minds of 50 million viewers a week ago. And even a far more competent damage control effort than the White House and the Biden campaign have mounted so far would have struggled to erase that impression. Attempts to explain his struggles in Atlanta are only refocusing attention on the core problem: super majorities of voters doubt he\u2019s fit enough to serve a new term that would end when he is 86. On Wednesday, for instance, the White House picked up Biden\u2019s line that he was jet lagged after two trips to Europe in early June. Given that the president had been back on US soil for over a week at the time of the debate, this only begged fresh questions over whether he\u2019s up to the onerous demands of the presidency \u2014 that frequently requires extensive travel. The idea that delayed jet lag \u2014 in combination with the cold that aides said he also had \u2014 could cause Biden to trail off in the middle of sentences and fail to make a coherent case on issues basic to his campaign did nothing to arrest his political slide. Jean-Pierre told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee Wednesday that the president had not had any kind of medical examination following the debate and since his last annual physical in February.\u00a0\u201cWe were able to talk to his doctor about that and that is a \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0But on Thursday, in another qualification likely to raise questions about the credibility of the White House on this issue, the story changed.\u00a0White House spokesman Andrew Bates said\u00a0that Biden was examined by his physician in the days following the debate.\u00a0\u201cSeveral days later, the president was seen to check on his cold and was recovering well,\u201d Bates said. The latest struggles in the West Wing mean that the focus is still on Biden\u2019s disintegrating campaign rather than the grave threat to democracy and America\u2019s political freedoms that the president warns is posed by Trump. At the end of a day of stinging blows to the president, a senior administration official told CNN\u2019s Lee that the gradual erosion of his support among Democrats was like \u201cwaves crashing into the shore.\u201d The official added: \u201cFirst it\u2019s the donors. And then it\u2019s elected officials. Now it\u2019s going to be polling. It just breaks down the resistance.\u201d Things started bad for Biden on Wednesday and then got worse. \u2014 A second Democratic elected official broke cover and called for Biden step aside from his reelection campaign. Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona told The New York Times he\u2019d back Biden if he was the nominee but that \u201cthis is an opportunity to look elsewhere.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat \u2014 and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.\u201d While few other lawmakers have been so frank, there are many more who share the views of Grijalva and Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett who spoke out on Tuesday. \u2014 A jolt of new polling had bad news for Biden. A New York Times/Siena College survey found Trump now leads by 49% to 43% among likely voters nationally, picking up a three-point swing from a week earlier before the debate. In the CNN Poll of Polls, the ex-president leads by five points (49% to 44%, in head-to-head\u00a0polls\u00a0conducted entirely after last Thursday\u2019s presidential debate). Candidates who win debates often get a blip in polling that later recedes. But Biden came into the showdown behind and needed to gain altitude. Instead, he\u2019s trending in the opposite direction after squandering his best chance to reset the race. \u2014 White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre endured yet another rough ride in the briefing room, as she came up with a new explanation of why Biden performed so badly in Atlanta, which she insisted was not an excuse. \u201cWhat I want to say is, it\u2019s the jet lag and also the cold right?\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the two things and that occurred, and you heard it in his voice when he did the debate.\u201d \u2014 Biden launched a round of calls to key Democratic power brokers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, and his friend Delaware Sen. Chris Coons. He also recorded two radio interviews that will air Thursday in swing states Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And Biden had the Democratic governors to the White House. Two, Minnesota\u2019s Tim Walz and Maryland\u2019s Wes Moore, offered him a boost with supportive comments to reporters. But Moore, a Democratic rising star, also said: \u201cWe always believe that when you when you love someone, you tell them the truth. And I think we came in and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We were honest about the concerns that we are hearing from people.\u201d \u2014 Another governor \u2014 and potential alternative nominee \u2013 Gavin Newsom of California, said in a statement to CNN that Biden was \u201call in. And so am I. Joe Biden\u2019s had our back. Now it\u2019s time to have his.\u201d There is no sign that the sentiments are not genuine. But there\u2019s also no political incentive for any Democratic Party power player eyeing the future to risk being seen to destabilize an already wounded president. Several possible alternative nominees, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Vice President Kamala Harris, were in Biden\u2019s meetings with the governors. \u2014 Some of the top Democrats in the House said it was time for the president to step aside, in a call with top party leadership in the chamber, CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer reported. But some members were also concerned about the frenzy that could ensue if the president went and left a power vacuum on the presidential ticket. \u2014 There were the first signs on Wednesday that the Trump campaign is calibrating how far the ex-president would need to pivot if Biden abandons his reelect. Co-campaign chairs Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles issued a statement warning that any replacement could expect a hammering for hiding \u201cthe truth from the American public\u201d about Biden\u2019s condition. \u201cEvery one of them has lied about Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris,\u201d they wrote. \u2014 Biden\u2019s vehement vows to stay in the race appeared to be a response to reporting in The New York Times and on CNN that the president understands the coming days are critical and could end his campaign. The White House and the campaign said the reports were false. But any sign Biden is wavering could be disastrous to on-the-ground campaigns in swing states. If Biden does get out, he\u2019ll probably be insisting he\u2019s in until the final moments. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reported that a succession plan is taking shape that could see the president immediately throw his support, his campaign war chest and his delegates behind the vice president to head off a fight for the nomination that could split the party. \u2014 Biden\u2019s new reality was on show in the afternoon when he presided over a ceremony to posthumously award the Medal of Honor to two Civil War soldiers. The event was carried live on cable TV, in a sign that every move the president makes from now until November will be filtered through the prism of his debate failure and parsed for new signs of decaying faculties. \u2014\u00a0Another problem for Biden is that key Democratic figures who remain supportive of the president are making clear he must do more to reshape public perceptions of his capabilities and do not rule out him quitting the race. \u201cWe are going to trust him to make the right decision about the crossroads that we are at right now,\u201d Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said on CNN. And Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, summed up Biden\u2019s critical days ahead when she warned: \u201cHe has got a very short period of time to talk to the American people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/politics/biden-rising-tide-pressure-reelection-bid-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_warner-senators-biden-future", "text": "An effort is underway by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner to get Senate Democrats on the same page about the future of President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid, sources told CNN, putting further pressure on the White House as it struggles to handle questions about the president\u2019s mental fitness and the viability of his campaign. Warner, who is taking on a leadership role in the effort, is reaching a place where he thinks it is time for Biden to suspend his reelection campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. The Biden administration and campaign have grappled in recent days with how to spin the president\u2019s poor debate performance, offering contradicting excuses and making the argument that Biden\u2019s record in the past three years is more significant than his shaky 90-minute standoff with former President Donald Trump. However, the debate only exacerbated concerns about the president\u2019s health and questions on whether he is fit to serve another four years in office. As pressure has increased within the party, some Democrats have\u00a0urged the president to consider\u00a0whether he is the party\u2019s best chance at beating Trump in November, while others have gone as far as to call for him to step aside as their presumptive nominee. Warner\u2019s meeting with his colleagues, first reported by\u00a0The Washington Post, is expected to take place Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning. Biden responded to reports of Warner\u2019s efforts on Friday, telling ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos in an interview that \u201cMark is a good man\u201d but he has a \u201cdifferent perspective.\u201d \u201cWell, Mark is a good man. We\u2019ve never had that. He also tried to get the nomination too. Mark\u2019s not, Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him,\u201d he said without elaborating, adding that members of Democratic congressional leadership have told him to \u201cstay in the race.\u201d Warner declined CNN\u2019s request for comment. His spokeswoman, Rachel Cohen, neither confirmed nor denied the senator\u2019s efforts in a statement to the Post earlier Friday, saying: \u201cLike many other people in Washington and across the country, Senator Warner believes these are critical days for the president\u2019s campaign, and he has made that clear to the White House.\u201d Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is summoning his members to a virtual meeting Sunday\u00a0with\u00a0Democratic committee ranking members,\u00a0which is expected to focus on Biden, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. Jeffries\u2019 meeting was first reported by\u00a0NBC News. Biden privately told an ally earlier this week that the next stretch of days is critical to whether he can save his reelection bid. But the president remained defiant Friday, telling reporters before boarding Air Force One following a campaign rally in Wisconsin that he is \u201ccompletely ruling out\u201d getting out of the 2024 race. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview", "text": "President Joe Biden sat down with ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos for\u00a0a high-stakes interview\u00a0on Friday, the week after a poor debate performance prompted questions about his fitness for the presidency and calls for him to withdraw from the 2024 race. Here is a fact check of some of Biden\u2019s claims in the interview. New York Times polling Biden claimed that \u201cthe New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that he gained a point in New York Times polling after the debate is false. In fact, the Times\u2019 post-debate poll, conducted with Siena College,\u00a0showed Biden doing three points worse\u00a0against former President Donald Trump than he had done in the\u00a0final Times/Siena poll before the debate. Biden\u2019s specific numbers were also wrong. He was not \u201cdown 10 points before the debate\u201d in Times/Siena polling. In fact, he was down three percentage points with likely voters and six percentage points with registered voters. In the Times/Siena poll after the debate, those margins grew to six percentage points with likely voters and nine percentage points with registered voters. Biden did acknowledge his uncertainty about the data when he said \u201cor whatever the hell it is.\u201d But he was wrong, nonetheless. Sen. Mark Warner and the presidency When Stephanopoulos noted a\u00a0Friday report in The Washington Post\u00a0that said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is trying to put together a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Biden to withdraw from the election, Biden responded, \u201cWell, Mark is a good man. We\u2019ve never had that \u2013 he also tried to get the nomination too. Mark\u2019s not \u2013 Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that \u201che also tried to get the nomination too\u201d needs context. Warner has never run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did\u00a0make extensive preparations\u00a0for a possible run for the 2008 nomination, including hiring staff and raising millions for a political action committee, but he\u00a0announced in October 2006\u00a0that he had decided not to launch a campaign after all. And he has not sought the nomination since then. Biden did run in that 2008 presidential primary, which was won by Barack Obama. Trump and bleach Biden repeated his familiar claim that Trump \u201cis a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with Covid.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim is misleading. Trump never portrayed his ill-informed and widely denounced musings about using disinfectants to address Covid-19 as advice to Americans. Rather, Trump was talking about the possibility of scientists conducting tests of this idea. Trump made his remarks, at a\u00a0press briefing in April 2020\u00a0after Bill\u00a0Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said sunlight or disinfectants like\u00a0bleach\u00a0and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces and in saliva. When Trump jumped shortly afterward to the dangerous idea of injecting disinfectants inside people\u2019s bodies, he said: \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were\u00a0slammed by medical experts\u00a0as highly dangerous, and they prompted urgent\u00a0warnings\u00a0from public health authorities and companies that sell household disinfectants. But he never actually said he was suggesting citizens go and use such products. Trump and jobs Biden repeated another one of his regular campaign claims about his Republican opponent, saying Trump was the only president other than Herbert Hoover \u201cwho lost more jobs than he created.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is true, but Biden left out some important context. While there was a\u00a0loss of about\u00a02.7\u00a0million\u00a0jobs\u00a0from the beginning of Trump\u2019s four-year term to the end, there was a gain of about 6.7 million jobs until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country about three years into that term.\u00a0 Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March 2020 and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. The US then started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million from May 2020 through December 2020, but not enough to make up the massive early-pandemic losses.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}

But it is rare, and no president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness. One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than President Joe Biden would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns. Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that if Biden were to drop out now \u2013 something he has so far shown no sign of doing \u2013 it would be the latest such decision in history. Johnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does. Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right. But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection. Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House. Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden still has Democratic nomination sewn up, and he would have to choose to give it up. Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate. Roosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another. Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten\u00a0strips of paper\u00a0given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election.\u00a0The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise. Three 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats. James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said: Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents. Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president. Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction. Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876. Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate. For Democrats today, holding on to at least one lever of power in Washington is a major priority as they fret over a possible second Trump term. If Biden becomes convinced that his own candidacy risks a Democratic wipeout, he might be swayed to step aside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_joe-biden-house-democrats", "text": "President Joe Biden told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he will continue his reelection bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign, while also hitting back at party \u201celites\u201d in an interview ahead of a critical week on Capitol Hill. \u201cI want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\u201d Biden wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN. Biden sought to put growing concerns about his viability to rest in the forcefully worded letter. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden concluded. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d It\u2019s a critical week for Biden\u2019s political future as he seeks to tamp down intensifying fallout with the House and Senate back in session for the first time since the debate. More than a handful of top House Democrats told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday that Biden needs to step aside amid concerns about down-ballot Democratic races. Shortly after the letter was released, Biden called into MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d part of a strategy to do more \u201coff-the-cuff,\u201d unscripted engagements to quell concerns about his age. But the appearance, while energetic, may not have had its intended impact. Biden offered a lengthy and occasionally off-topic response to a question about his letter to Hill Democrats calling for unity and lambasted Trump for being on the golf course after the debate. Trump has largely stayed under the radar while Biden battles the news cycle. \u201cWell look \u2014 Democrats \u2014 Joe, let me say it this way, the reason I\u2019ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf cart before, golf cart before he even hits the ball \u2014 but anyway, he hasn\u2019t been anywhere in 10 days, I\u2019ve been all over the country, No. 1,\u201d he said. He continued: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gone over the country for several reasons, one, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them who\u2019ve voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, No. 1.\u201d And in a pointed rebuke to his critics, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites. Now, I\u2019m not talking about you guys, but by the elites in the party. They know so much more. But if any of these guys don\u2019t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce \u2014 announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d Critical week ahead on Capitol Hill The president will continue his outreach to Democratic lawmakers this week, a campaign official tells CNN. Tuesday will be a consequential day as members are set hold a planned caucus meeting with Jeffries, and one member told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Two sources told CNN that the meeting, the first time Democrats are gathering as a caucus since the June 27 debate, will be limited to members only and phones are not expected to be permitted inside. Biden will meet virtually with the Congressional Black Caucus Monday night, two sources told CNN. The CBC is arguably the president\u2019s strongest group of support on Capitol Hill and is a key group for him heading into Tuesday\u2019s Democratic caucus meeting. NBC News was first to report on the meeting with the CBC. In the week following his disastrous debate performance, Biden personally reached out to roughly 20 House Democrats, a campaign official tells CNN, and has spoken with party leaders \u2014 including Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn \u2014 with a goal of reassuring them that the concerns within the party are being heard. Since then, Jeffries, Schumer and Clyburn have voiced support for Biden. Despite divisions in his caucus about Biden\u2019s viability in November, Jeffries insisted on Monday that he is still behind the president. \u201cYes, I made clear the day after the debate, publicly, that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket,\u201d Jeffries told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju when asked about Biden. \u201cMy position has not changed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m for Joe,\u201d Schumer told reporters when he arrived at the Capitol Monday and was asked if he supports the president continuing his race for reelection. He would not answer if he has any questions about Biden\u2019s mental and physical ability to lead the nation for four more years. Pelosi has said the questions surrounding Biden\u2019s disastrous performance at the presidential debate were \u201clegitimate.\u201d Asked about Pelosi\u2019s comments, Biden told ABC News, \u201cit was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted.\u201d Several House Democrats have already publicly called for Biden to drop out of the presidential race, with Washington state Rep. Adam Smith becoming the latest to do so Monday afternoon. \u201cWell, look, I think he should step aside,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s become clear that he\u2019s not the best person to carry the Democratic message. And here\u2019s the thing: We have an incredibly strong message and record to run on. And all respect to the president, he\u2019s done a great job.\u201d But Smith added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message. The president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way.\u201d On a call with senior House Democrats convened Sunday by Jeffries, Smith was one of a half-dozen lawmakers who voiced their own concerns during a conversation one aide described to CNN as \u201cpretty brutal.\u201d Those lawmakers \u2014 which CNN has reported to include Reps. Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano and Joe Morelle \u2014 represent the highest-ranking Democrats on the Armed Services, Judiciary, Veterans Affairs and House Administration committees. A campaign official declined to say whether the president had spoken directly with Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who organized a concurrent effort among like-minded senators to explore the possibility of an official request for Biden to step aside. Warner canceled a follow-up meeting scheduled for Monday evening, a source tells CNN, after news of the group\u2019s efforts leaked. The next meeting will be Tuesday with Senate Democrats and their leadership. Biden told ABC News that Warner was a \u201cgood man\u201d but has a \u201cdifferent perspective.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign on Monday highlighted a list of supportive statements from Hill Democrats, seeking to amplify the voices who have expressed confidence in the president\u2019s candidacy in recent days. Biden team hosted another top donor call Also on Monday, the Biden campaign hosted a donor call with its national finance committee, another sign of outreach. A top concern of the campaign is whether donors will continue to back Biden or redirect their money to House and Senate campaign efforts if he stays in the race. Biden said he is not exiting the race and that he believes he\u2019s still the best candidate to beat Trump, three participants told CNN. \u201cMy one job is to beat Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said, according to one of the participants on the call, who said Biden thanked donors and renewed his pledge to keep the fight alive. A second participant said of the president\u2019s determination to continue running: \u201cHe ain\u2019t budging an inch.\u201d Campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon lead the call, which had more than 300 participants, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore offered a fiery defense of the president, the participants told CNN. Moore was among the governors who met with Biden at the White House last week, telling reporters after the meeting he supports the president but acknowledged the concerns from voters. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, Biden fielded a question from a donor about what he needs to do in the second debate \u2014 currently scheduled for September 10 \u2014 to perform better than the first debate, where 51 million Americans watched his meandering and low-energy performance. Biden, dressed in a suit and flanked by an American flag and family photographs, outlined the strategy simply, two participants said: \u201cAttack, attack, attack.\u201d DNC Finance Chair Chris Korge, who was among the final speakers on the call, was \u201cbegging us to stay in line,\u201d one of the participants said. Biden struck a defiant note on a call with donors, emphasizing that the party needs to shift the narrative back to Trump and the important issues at stake in November. There was a fair amount of discussion, according to one donor on the call, on \u201cProject 2025.\u201d Biden made clear how damaging Trump\u2019s agenda would be across the board, including for the economy, women and the LGBTQ community, one donor said. Biden also smiled on screen when one donor said she would crawl through glass for him. Another participant on the call, who has been critical of Biden and his campaign over the past week, praised the president\u2019s words on Monday and said the campaign seemed to \u201cfinally\u201d grasp the seriousness of the moment. The ultimate test, this donor said, would be whether congressional leaders urge Biden to reconsider this week and whether the battleground map showed any signs of expanding or if the president\u2019s support eroded in campaign polling this week following the long July 4 holiday weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s still a huge hole to climb out of,\u201d the Democratic donor said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign. \u201cIt was already a steep hill to climb to victory.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.

Judge Aileen Cannon set a two-week briefing schedule for those arguments and paused three unrelated filing deadlines that were scheduled to take place during that period.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_us-air-force-arsenal-cost-increase", "text": "The\u00a0US\u00a0Air Force\u2019s\u00a0project to\u00a0modernize its\u00a0nuclear missile arsenal\u00a0is projected to cost approximately $141 billion, which is\u00a0roughly 81% more than previously anticipated,\u00a0and will be delayed by several years,\u00a0officials said Monday. A review of the Sentinel program was conducted after the Air Force said in January its costs were exceeding baseline projections. The review found that the cost of the program is estimated to be $140.9 billion \u2014\u00a0an 81% increase from the cost estimate made in September 2020. The Sentinel program is a massive effort to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system,\u00a0which was introduced in\u00a0the 1970s,\u00a0with\u00a0Sentinel\u00a0intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0Air Force Global Strike Command, the Sentinel\u00a0will extend the\u00a0US\u2019\u00a0land-based\u00a0nuclear\u00a0capabilities \u201cthrough 2075.\u201d \u201cThere are reasons for this cost growth, but there are also no excuses,\u201d Dr. Bill LaPlante, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, said on Monday. \u201cWe fully appreciate the magnitude of the cost, but we also understand the risks of not modernizing our nuclear forces, and of not addressing the very real threats we confront.\u201d As a result of the cost\u00a0increase, LaPlante said he has directed the Air Force to restructure the program and\u00a0put\u00a0an \u201cappropriate management structure\u201d in place to control costs \u2014\u00a0which will delay it by \u201cseveral years.\u201d He also rescinded approval for it to enter the engineering and manufacturing development phase. Typically, if\u00a0the costs of a\u00a0program increase\u00a0by\u00a025% or more,\u00a0it\u00a0has to\u00a0be terminated unless the\u00a0under secretary\u00a0of defense for acquisition and sustainment \u201ccertifies to Congress that the program meets established criteria to continue,\u201d a news release on Monday said. LaPlante told reporters on Monday he was doing exactly that.\u00a0He said the modernization program is \u201cessential to national security,\u201d\u00a0and is\u00a0higher priority than programs whose funding\u00a0will\u00a0need to be cut to accommodate\u00a0the rising costs\u00a0with\u00a0\u201cno alternatives\u201d that would match the\u00a0Sentinel\u00a0program\u2019s capabilities for a lower price. LaPlante attributed the inaccuracy of the original cost estimate to insufficient knowledge on a piece of the program. Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Jim\u00a0Slife\u00a0added Monday that\u00a0decisions on of what funding trade-offs the Air Force will need to make\u00a0in order to\u00a0fund Sentinel won\u2019t need to be decided for another few years.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_wisconsin-supreme-court-ballot-boxes", "text": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday that officials can place ballot drop boxes around their communities in this fall\u2019s elections, overturning its own ruling two years ago limiting their use in the presidential swing state. The court limited the use of drop boxes in July 2022, ruling then that they could be placed only in local election clerks\u2019 offices and no one other than the voter could return a ballot in person. Conservatives controlled the court at that time, but\u00a0Janet Protasiewicz\u2019s election victory\u00a0in April 2023 flipped the court to liberal control. Seeing an opening, Priorities USA, a progressive voter mobilization group, asked the court in February to revisit the decision. At least 29 other states allow for absentee ballot drop boxes, according to the US Vote Foundation, and expanded use in Wisconsin could have major implications in the presidential race. Wisconsin again figures to be a crucial swing state after President Joe Biden barely won it in 2020 and Donald Trump narrowly took it in 2016. Democrats believe that making it easier to vote absentee will boost turnout for their side. The justices\u00a0announced in March\u00a0they would review the ban on drop boxes but wouldn\u2019t consider any other parts of the case. The move drew the ire of the court\u2019s conservatives, who accused the liberals of trying to give Democrats an advantage this fall. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in April\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to again allow drop boxes. The court ruled 4-3 on Friday that drop boxes can be utilized in any location. Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, one of the court\u2019s four liberal justices, wrote for the majority that placing a ballot in a drop box set up and maintained by a local election clerk is no different than giving the ballot to the clerk, regardless of the box\u2019s location. Local clerks have great discretion in how they administer elections and that extends to using and locating drop boxes, she added. \u201cOur decision today does not force or require that any municipal clerks use drop boxes,\u201d Bradley wrote. \u201cIt merely acknowledges what (state law) has always meant: that clerks may lawfully utilize secure drop boxes in an exercise of their statutorily-conferred discretion.\u201d All three conservative justices dissented. Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote that the liberals are simply trying to advance their political agenda and criticized them for ignoring the precedent set by the 2022 ruling. \u201cThe majority in this case overrules (the 2022 decision) not because it is legally erroneous, but because the majority finds it politically inconvenient,\u201d Bradley wrote. \u201cThe majority\u2019s activism marks another triumph of political power over legal principle in this court.\u201d The popularity of absentee voting exploded during the pandemic in 2020, with more than 40% of all voters casting mail ballots, a record high. At least 500 drop boxes were set up in more than 430 communities for the election that year, including more than a dozen each in Madison and Milwaukee \u2014 the state\u2019s two most heavily Democratic cities. Trump and Republicans have alleged that drop boxes facilitated cheating, even though they offered no evidence. Democrats, election officials and some Republicans argued the boxes are secure and an\u00a0Associated Press survey\u00a0of state election officials across the U.S. revealed no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft that could have affected the results in 2020. Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature intervened in the case, arguing that the justices should leave the 2022 ruling alone. Their attorney, Misha Tseytlin, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday. Matt Fisher, a spokesperson for the state Republican Party, called the decision a \u201csetback.\u201d \u201cThis latest attempt by leftist justices to placate their far-left backers will not go unanswered by voters,\u201d he said in a statement. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, who administers elections in the state\u2019s most Democratic county, called drop boxes a \u201ccommon sense tool.\u201d He said they make the election process more convenient and easier for rural and disabled voters and help reduce that number of ballots that arrive after election day too late to be counted. \u201cHaving drop boxes in place for the 2024 elections in August and November will encourage civic participation in our democracy,\u201d McDonell said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-ballot-boxes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is rejecting any idea that he would step aside as the Democratic nominee, a decision that is his alone. When we asked readers what questions they have about Biden, they expressed some confusion about the process that made him the presumptive Democratic nominee. Here are answers to some of the questions posed to CNN from readers: No. There was a series of primaries in states and territories this year and voters in those contests overwhelmingly backed Biden. He faced only token opposition from a little-known congressman, Rep. Dean Phillips, and an author, Marianne Williamson. Biden won nearly all of the 3,949 pledged delegates who will officially select the party\u2019s nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Delegates pick the nominee during a roll-call vote. While party rules don\u2019t formally require delegates to vote for the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged, they\u2019re supposed to, and campaigns have the right to approve the delegates pledged to their candidates. Biden has the votes to win the nomination in that first round of voting and realistically, it\u2019s highly unlikely that another candidate could be elected without Biden voluntarily stepping aside. This is an unprecedented situation. Primaries began in January and went on for months. That monthslong process provided Democrats and independents who wanted to take part in the Democratic primary the opportunity to back a different candidate. Each one of those primaries, arguably, was a sort of off-ramp. But Democrats at the time were largely rallying behind Biden. That was, however, before his poor debate performance fed festering concerns about his age. It is remarkable that even though polling has long suggested voters feel Biden is too old and would have preferred a different choice, high quality opponents did not challenge him. Phillips and Williamson never gained traction and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. left the Democratic Party to run as an independent rather than challenge Biden for the party nomination. The party also worked hard to discourage opposition to Biden. It did not sponsor debates, and multiple states, including Delaware and Florida, did not hold Democratic primaries after it was clear that Biden had the delegates to win the nomination. Delegates are supposed to honor the voters in their states. Here\u2019s the language in the Democratic party rules for the 2024 convention: \u201cAll delegates to the National Convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d Primaries are an important part of the process and primary voters chose Biden. Not that they had much choice; the party worked hard to unify early behind Biden and discouraged serious opposition. But delegates technically pick the party nominee, which is why it would probably take Biden releasing the delegates he won to replace him on the ticket. We received several versions of this question, not all of them fit to print. The large universe of people who believe Trump is unfit to be president have thought that for a long time. There is a universe of people who are newly questioning Biden\u2019s fitness after the debate. I would point out that figure \u2013 that Trump lied more than 30 times at the debate \u2013 is directly reported in CNN\u2019s Fact Check of the debate. From that report: Trump\u2019s repeat falsehoods included his assertions that some Democratic-led states\u00a0allow babies to be executed after birth, that\u00a0every legal scholar and everybody in general wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, that there were\u00a0no terror attacks during his presidency, that\u00a0Iran didn\u2019t fund terror groups during his presidency,\u00a0that\u00a0the US has provided more aid to Ukraine than Europe has, that\u00a0Biden for years referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators,\u201d that Biden is\u00a0planning to quadruple people\u2019s taxes, that\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 National Guard troops for the US Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u00a0that Americans don\u2019t pay the cost of his tariffs on China and other countries, that\u00a0Europe accepts no American cars, that\u00a0he is the president who got the Veterans Choice program through Congress, and\u00a0that fraud marred the results of the 2020 election. So I believe it is inaccurate to say the media is giving Trump a pass. Trump, for his part, has all but disappeared from the campaign trail since the debate and Biden is holding events, doing TV and audio interviews and more as he engages in damage control. There has also been ample coverage of Trump\u2019s criminal trial, his many other legal troubles, and his often outrageous claims and policy proposals. Biden argues he has the best chance of winning and says the pollsters he talks to say the race is a tossup. High-quality public polling since the debate, on the other hand, suggests Trump does have a lead. In hypothetical matchups in which other Democrats are put up against Trump, the results are not currently much different. If those numbers start to change dramatically, pressure on Biden to drop out will increase dramatically. When I put this question to CNN\u2019s polling director, Jennifer Agiesta, she cautioned that polling is frequently misinterpreted as a tool to predict the future. It does not tell us who has a better chance of winning, but the state of the race in a particular moment. \u201cEven before the debate there was almost no polling showing Biden with a significant lead of Trump nationally or in key states,\u201d Agiesta said. \u201cIn a two-way matchup between Trump and Biden, there hasn\u2019t been a high-quality poll showing a significant Biden lead since February.\u201d Biden says he does not have a debilitating cognitive condition so it does not appear he is hiding one. His advisers argue that he maintains a full campaign and governing schedule and he frequently appears in public, although his advisers have clearly tried to minimize unscripted moments. Impeachment is utilized to punish \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d according to the US Constitution. Republican efforts to impeach Biden, which have so far failed, have focused not on his age, but on his son\u2019s former business interests. The 25th Amendment provides a pathway to dislodge an incapacitated president, but it is a complicated process and would require a majority of Biden\u2019s Cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris to agree in writing that he is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d None of his allies are currently saying that about him. But if, in the future, a majority of his Cabinet and Harris (or some other body appointed by Congress) turned on Biden and tried to declare him incapacitated, he could dispute their finding and resume his duties. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days in which to double down on their declaration that the president was unfit, at which point both houses of Congress would have 21 days to decide in a vote if he should carry on as president. It would require two-thirds of the Senate (usually 67 of 100 senators) and two-thirds of the House (usually 290 of 435 representatives) to remove the president from office. Democrats have not exactly turned on Biden. Only a handful of elected Democrats have publicly argued he should step down as the party\u2019s candidate in 2024. But they are almost universally worried that Trump will beat Biden in a rematch. Not only do Democrats disagree with the former president\u2019s policies, they also view him as a destabilizing threat to American democracy. If Biden is not viewed as capable by the few independent voters who might support either candidate, it makes a Trump election more likely. This would get very complicated, as CNN\u2019s David Wright has written: It\u2019s a significant war chest that\u00a0totaled $240 million at the end of June, including the Democratic National Convention and allied committees, according to an announcement from Biden\u2019s campaign on Tuesday. At the end of May, Biden\u2019s campaign account alone held $91.6 million, according to the most recent available data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). If Harris\u00a0were\u00a0tapped as a replacement nominee, she would take over the existing campaign account, and have control of funds deposited there, per FEC rules. If the race were thrown open,\u00a0the Biden-Harris campaign could\u00a0transfer all of\u00a0its\u00a0cash on hand\u00a0to the Democratic National Committee, as\u00a0FEC rules\u00a0permit unlimited transfers from candidate committees to national party committees. The DNC could use those funds in several ways to support a new nominee, and could distribute that money to a variety of other down ballot candidates and allied committees \u2013 but in doing so, the DNC would be limited by FEC rules governing spending and contributions\u00a0for national party committees. There are other options, each with its own set of drawbacks, according to Wright, including turning Biden\u2019s campaign account into a PAC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_donald-trump-vp-convention-planning", "text": "Donald Trump is entering a critical stretch of his presidential campaign in an unfamiliar place: out\u00a0of the spotlight. Over the next 10 days, the former president will announce his running mate, hold a pair of campaign rallies and kick off a Republican convention in Milwaukee where he will officially become the party\u2019s\u00a0presidential nominee for the third time in eight years. But the rollout of Trump\u2019s summer plans have been overshadowed by the dramatic fallout over President Joe Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performance and a Democratic Party in the throes of a crisis about its expected nominee.\u00a0While the Trump campaign was happy to sit back and watch Biden and his allies spiral through the holiday weekend, the former president is quickly approaching a marquee period over which he planned to be the center of attention. That is no longer the expectation, though, and his campaign is now\u00a0trying to navigate how to maximize the rollout of his vice presidential\u00a0pick under unprecedented circumstances while pulling off a convention that can successfully set up the new ticket for the final 3\u00bd months of the race. Uncertainty around Biden\u00a0may have\u00a0also injected new factors for Trump and his advisers to consider in a running mate. Though Trump had previously indicated he had already made a selection \u201cin my mind,\u201d a Republican fundraiser close to the former president said the prospect of Biden ending his White House bid has likely altered Trump\u2019s\u00a0calculus. Trump\u2019s search for a running mate has focused on three names: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. Trump\u2019s campaign had previously said that \u201cthe top criteria in selecting a vice president\u00a0is a strong leader who will make a great president\u00a0for eight years after his next four-year term concludes.\u201d Such guidelines appeared to give an edge to Rubio, 53, and Vance, 39, over the 67-year-old Burgum. As the youngest and closest to the far-right forces in the former president\u2019s orbit, Vance appears best positioned to campaign as an heir to Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, if that is the former president\u2019s preference. Rubio\u2019s proximity to donors and the governing class is\u00a0viewed as stabilizing to Republicans in Washington, while Trump\u2019s continued fixation on Burgum suggests he may be more interested in casting for the role of running mate\u00a0than in\u00a0picking a successor. When to unveil that pick, though, has become a\u00a0moving target, particularly\u00a0given the overwhelming focus on Biden. Another wave of reaction from Democrats about their nominee\u2019s fitness for the office is expected Monday when members of Congress return from recess. Biden, meanwhile, is participating in a NATO summit this week in Washington\u00a0and is scheduled to hold a news\u00a0conference Thursday where he is certain to face questions about his future. Trump\u2019s campaign views Monday, July 15 \u2013 the opening night of the Republican convention in Milwaukee \u2013 as the deadline to present his vice presidential\u00a0choice. With party business planned for that morning, the announcement could come just before the official nomination. Preparing for Harris Though Trump once measured his potential picks by how they might stack up against Vice President Kamala Harris in a one-on-one debate, those calculations would be tossed aside if she is elevated to the top of the Democratic ticket. Those around Trump increasingly view that as an outcome they may have to face. Harris\u2019 potential ascent amid Biden\u2019s physical decline has crystalized the need for the 78-year-old Trump to pick someone voters believe can step into the job, the Republican fundraiser argued. Still, few people have a clear insight into Trump\u2019s preference at the moment. One person who has aided past vice presidential contenders and is advising another this time told CNN that of all the vetting processes he has observed from the inside, \u201cThis is the one with the littlest information possible\u201d getting back to the prospective running mates from the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s going to be Trump\u2019s decision and Trump\u2019s decision alone,\u201d the person said. Sources close to some of the top contenders have also indicated they are in the dark \u2013 often reading tea leaves and media reports to gauge where the process stands. Against that reality, the auditioning in the veepstakes continued through the weekend. In competing appearances on television Sunday, Vance and Rubio staked out somewhat opposing views on Trump\u2019s vow of retribution illustrative of their competing pitches for the job. Vance, who has the backing of several figures leading the calls for\u00a0revenge on Trump\u2019s political opponents\u00a0\u2013 most notably the recently imprisoned former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, as well as Trump\u2019s eldest\u00a0son,\u00a0Donald Jr.\u00a0\u2013 embraced the suggestion that former President Trump, if elected, could appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden. \u201cI would absolutely support investigating prior wrongdoing by our government, absolutely,\u201d Vance told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Rubio, meanwhile, appeared more skeptical that Trump would\u00a0choose such a path. \u201cHe was president for four years. He didn\u2019t go after Hillary Clinton. He didn\u2019t go after Joe Biden. He didn\u2019t go after Barack Obama,\u201d Rubio told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Burgum did not appear on the Sunday political shows\u00a0this weekend. In a sign that even Trump\u2019s closest allies do not believe his mind is made up, other names continue to get suggested. Speaking on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d\u00a0on Sunday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham pushed for his Palmetto State partner Sen. Tim Scott but also cautioned against overlooking Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. \u201cIf we win Virginia, we win,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt is over.\u201d Convention anxieties The Republican convention itself remains a work in progress,\u00a0and planning for Milwaukee is taking place under the assumption that nearly every aspect of the party\u2019s quadrennial fete will be viewed through the prism of the tumult unfolding in the other camp. The Republican Party has released few details about the convention, including the lineup of speakers or Trump\u2019s plans around the four days of festivities. The meeting of the party\u2019s platform committee this week will offer an early window into how Trump intends to flex his dominance of the party at the convention. The committee\u2019s\u00a0work, an insider-driven process typically followed closely only by party die-hards, has drawn heightened scrutiny this year from some conservative groups shaken by the Trump campaign\u2019s recent demands for the 2024 GOP platform. In a memo\u00a0last month, Trump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita outlined their expectations to dramatically scale back the platform from its sprawling and dense 66 pages to a document that is \u201cclear, concise and easily digestible\u201d for voters. The Republican Party is also planning for the first time to keep the deliberations behind closed doors, a choice that earned a rebuke last week from Family Research Council President\u00a0Tony Perkins, who called the idea \u201cun-American.\u201d The\u00a0platform debate was already set to take place amid intensifying anxiety from conservative groups, especially as the party crafts its first official position on abortion since the fall of Roe v. Wade. Trump has backed off his past support for a national abortion ban, which the party has advocated in its platform for decades, and anti-abortion groups have warned against removing the language to match Trump\u2019s latest stance on the issue. Perkins wrote that limiting access to the platform committee\u00a0\u201cheightens speculation that the GOP platform will be watered down to a few pages of meaningless, poll-tested talking points.\u201d Rubio, a co-sponsor of a Senate bill to ban abortion nationwide at 20 weeks with some exceptions, said on Sunday that Trump\u2019s position is \u201cgrounded in reality\u201d and that the party should follow him. \u201cOur platform has to reflect our nominee,\u201d Rubio said. Back on the trail Trump will reemerge on the campaign trail this week,\u00a0with rallies planned in\u00a0South Florida on Tuesday and in Pennsylvania on Saturday \u2013 his first\u00a0public events since the day after the debate. The former president has spent much of the past week lying low at his Bedminster resort in New Jersey\u00a0\u2013 golfing and giving his staff a break for the holiday weekend. But Trump broke his silence on the Democratic hand-wringing with a weekend social media post mockingly urging his rival to remain in the race. \u201cJoe Biden should ignore his many critics and move forward, with alacrity and strength, with his powerful and far reaching campaign,\u201d Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social. \u201cHe should be sharp, precise, and energetic, just like he was in The Debate.\u201d While the post was clearly intended to stir the pot, it was also a sign of the growing restlessness from within Trump\u2019s presidential campaign as his team waits for Democrats to settle on Biden or someone else. After Biden\u2019s televised interview with ABC aired Friday night, one senior Trump adviser acknowledged to CNN that\u00a0the 22-minute back-and-forth with George Stephanopoulos had not offered much clarity. Said the adviser: \u201cI thought he lived to fight another day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kit Maher contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/donald-trump-vp-convention-planning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_biden-radio-interview-questions", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s team provided a list of questions to a radio host who interviewed the president this week in the aftermath of his debate performance, the host told CNN. \u201cThe questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them,\u201d Andrea Lawful-Sanders, host of \u201cThe Source\u201d in Philadelphia, said during an interview Saturday with CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on \u201cFirst of All.\u201d When Blackwell asked Lawful-Sanders whether the White House sent her questions for approval, she said yes. \u201cI got several questions, eight of them, and the four that were chosen were the ones that I approved,\u201d she added. CNN reporting later clarified that it was the Biden campaign that handled the interview. Blackwell pointed out that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of \u201cThe Earl Ingram Show\u201d in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden \u201cessentially the same questions.\u201d A Biden campaign spokesperson on Saturday did not deny that the campaign provided questions but said that \u201cWe do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day \u2013 the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he\u2019d delivered for black Americans,\u201d spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement. The Biden campaign said later Saturday it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers. \u201cWhile interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions,\u201d a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN. The radio interviews came at a critical moment for Biden\u2019s political future as a growing number of elected officials, Democratic donors and supporters express deep concerns about his age and capacity to serve a second term as president. Biden on Friday also took questions from pool reporters and sat with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos for a 22-minute interview focused entirely on his age and fitness for office. He will again field questions from reporters during the NATO summit in Washington next week. Biden, who has faced enormous scrutiny this week, made some stumbles during his conversation with Lawful-Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be, as I said, the first vice president \u2013 first Black woman \u2013 to serve with a Black president, proud to have been involved with the first Black woman on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said during the interview, which taped Wednesday and aired Thursday. Reached for comment Thursday night, a Biden campaign spokesperson slammed the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of criticism of the president\u2019s missteps. \u201cIt was clear what President Biden meant when he was talking about his historic record including a record number of appointments to the federal bench,\u201d spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. Lawful-Sanders\u2019 remarks came after a Biden campaign social media account on Monday shared video of a local news anchor in Virginia saying Donald Trump\u2019s campaign backed out of an interview after asking for questions in advance. The interview was scheduled to take place around the former president\u2019s rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, the day after the debate. \u201cWe wanted to hear more from Trump tonight. Our Mike Gooding was scheduled to interview the former president after the rally,\u201d WVEC anchor Dan Kennedy said. \u201cBut just about 15 minutes ago the Trump team canceled on Mike Gooding after asking us what our questions would be for the former president, telling Mike that there was no more time and that the former president only wanted to talk about last night\u2019s debate.\u201d In a social media post sharing the video, the Biden campaign derided Trump for backing out of the interview, writing, \u201cA paranoid and overwhelmed Trump cancels his TV interview after asking the reporter what questions they planned on asking.\u201d When asked by CNN on Saturday whether Trump backed out of the interview, the former president\u2019s campaign ignored the claim and instead slammed Biden for allegedly providing questions to interviewers in advance. \u201cPresident Trump held a rally in Virginia and afterwards participated in local interviews that spanned numerous topics, not just related to the debate,\u201d campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said. \u201cMeanwhile, Joe Biden and his campaign are bullying media into asking pre-screened and approved questions and trying to pass it off like it\u2019s normal behavior. It\u2019s not.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_republican-platform-trump-abortion", "text": "The panel charged with crafting and producing a platform for the Republican National Committee has adopted a scaled-back document that softened language on abortion and same-sex marriage, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced Monday. In addition to editing some of the language, the former president wrote some portions of the party platform himself, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The new platform, which was quickly approved Monday by the RNC platform committee, reflects Trump\u2019s broader policy agenda on a range of issues as the presumptive Republican nominee continues to reshape the party in his third run for the White House. \u201cOurs is a forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate,\u201d Trump\u00a0said in a social media post Monday, praising the new platform. On abortion, the updated language mirrors Trump\u2019s position in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade that restrictions should now be left to the states. \u201cWe believe that the 14th\u00a0Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights,\u201d a draft document obtained by CNN reads. The new platform does not mention a national abortion ban, a policy some social conservatives wanted to see included, but which the former president has publicly said he opposes. After the platform was released, a leading anti-abortion group, SBA Pro-Life America, issued a statement saying that the platform reaffirms the party\u2019s \u201ccommitment to protect life through the 14th Amendment.\u201d The updated platform, which is called \u201cAmerica First: A Return to Common Sense,\u201d also no longer defines marriage as between \u201cone man and one woman.\u201d And instead of putting an emphasis on reducing the national debt, the platform calls to \u201cend inflation\u201d and \u201cMake America Affordable Again.\u201d The document also outlines Trump\u2019s stance on Social Security and Medicare, affirming the former president\u2019s stance against cutting benefits. The new platform amplifies rhetoric Trump frequently uses on the campaign trail, with a focus on immigration, calling for the border to be sealed. It also calls for ending \u201cthe weaponization of government against the American people.\u201d The platform was approved by an overwhelming vote of 84-18 during a closed-door vote, according to the source. The platform will be taken up at the full party convention, which begins in Milwaukee next week. This story and headline have been updated.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_biden-july-4-reelection-pressure-abc-interview", "text": "Every time things look like they can\u2019t get worse for President Joe Biden, they seem to do just that. The Fourth of July holiday brought no respite after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance, which raised concerns about his capacity to serve a second term and pitched his reelection campaign into an existential crisis. And the scrutiny will only increase on Friday with the airing of an ABC interview that will provide a critical test of the president\u2019s ability to stem panic in the Democratic Party exactly four months from Election Day. The latest effort by the White House to quell the controversy is already disintegrating.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0CNN reported Thursday\u00a0that the president had told Democratic state governors that he needed more sleep and that he\u2019d no longer schedule events after 8 p.m., three sources briefed on the comments said. His reasoning frustrated several governors who\u2019d come to the White House to seek reassurance about Biden\u2019s condition, sources said. And it is likely to raise further questions about whether the president is fit to fully execute the duties of the presidency now, let alone toward the end of a second term, when he would be 86. Biden\u2019s comment may also infuriate Democrats who want him to be far more visible and to throw himself into spontaneous, unscripted events to prove his stamina and sharpness. But Biden issued another defiant warning that he has no intention of stepping down, a day after several allies privately said he\u2019s aware that the coming days could be critical for his hopes of staying in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden told military families gathered to watch July Fourth fireworks at the White House. The administration\u2019s attempts to explain away the president\u2019s poor debate performance keep having the opposite effect. So far, Biden aides, officials or allies have suggested that he was overloaded by his debate prep team; that he was suffering from jet lag after two European trips, even though the debate took place more than a week after he got home; and that he had a cold. The White House\u2019s credibility took another hit Thursday when\u00a0it said that the president had in fact seen a physician\u00a0in the days following the debate, despite White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre having said the day before that the president hadn\u2019t been examined since his last full physical in February. The next big test in the president\u2019s comeback bid Biden\u2019s latest difficulties are only ramping up the pressure ahead of his critical interview that will air Friday night on ABC. The sit-down with George Stephanopoulos is one of the campaign\u2019s own self-imposed tests for Biden to dispel the image of a shaky and at times confused president that was seared into the minds of 50 million viewers at the CNN debate. Any sign of compromised mental sharpness in the interview could deal another blow to the campaign.\u00a0Democrats will also want Biden to make a powerful case for a second term and to adequately prosecute his argument against Trump \u2014 both arguments he failed to deliver during the debate in Atlanta last week. \u201cI had a bad night,\u201d Biden said in a radio interview on \u201cThe Earl Ingram Show,\u201d conducted on Wednesday. \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, that, you know, it was \u2014 I screwed up. I made a mistake. That\u2019s 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I\u2019ve done in 3.5 years.\u201d The problem with the president\u2019s argument is that the debate debacle has forced voters to consider not just the successes of his administration \u2014 which are comparable with those of any other modern Democratic president \u2014 but also whether they can imagine an even slower and more fragile president being in office years from now. The fallout from the debate is so potentially damaging because Biden\u2019s performance appeared to confirm the views of overwhelming majorities of voters that the president, at 81, is too old to be running for a second term. A week of building crisis has obliterated, at least temporarily, the comparison the Biden campaign had long hoped to draw with Trump, who is promising a campaign of retribution if he\u2019s reelected and who almost destroyed democracy in refusing to accept his loss in the 2020 election. And it means that every Biden appearance is now drawing a painful measure of scrutiny. On Thursday evening, he made it through a speech using familiar lines at the Independence Day party. His sentiments were deeply felt, but the effects of the president\u2019s advanced age were obvious, especially by comparison with public events from a few years ago. Democratic anxiety grows At least two Democratic lawmakers have so far called for Biden to step aside before the Democratic National Convention in August, and there is intense behind-the-scenes anxiety among party lawmakers who fear the president\u2019s problems could drag them down and hand the White House \u2014 as well as the Senate and the House of Representatives \u2014 to Republicans. Even Democrats who are standing firm behind Biden want him to do more to prove to voters that he is up to the job of a second White House term. Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents a district in Michigan \u2014 a critical swing state in November \u2014 said Thursday on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d that there was \u201ca lot of fear\u201d among voters about Biden\u2019s debate showing but added that voters also recognize the delicate process involved in any attempt to find a new nominee. She argued that Trump had also had a bad debate but implored Biden to step up the pace of his campaigning. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go out there and show it this week,\u201d she said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in the\u00a0governors\u2019 meeting at the White House on Wednesday, vigorously defended Biden after campaigning on his behalf in Michigan. And he downplayed potential Biden schedule curtailments, which are certain to be seized upon by Republicans to reinforce their arguments that he is not up to the job of commander-in-chief. \u201cThat\u2019s called human,\u201d Newsom told CNN. \u201cAnd God bless, I like when a president acknowledges they\u2019re human. And so I think people are reading between the lines too much on that.\u201d Newsom, seen as a potential alternative contender if\u00a0Biden\u00a0decides to exit the race, was asked whether he would support Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee in such circumstances. He said he\u2019s \u201cnot going to play into that\u201d but acknowledged the question was legitimate. Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz noted that Trump hardly showed rigor, claiming the ex-president \u201cspends half of his day ranting on Truth Social about plans that would cause a recession and the other half golfing.\u201d And he said that \u201cnormal presidents strike a balance,\u201d arguing that President George W. Bush went to bed at 9 p.m. and President Barack Obama had dinner with his family at 6:30 at night \u2014 a concession, however, to his daughters\u2019 youth, not Obama\u2019s age at the time Biden\u2019s struggles are forcing the Trump campaign to contemplate a possibly changing electoral equation. The former president has now started to augment his attacks\u00a0on his successor\u00a0with new attempts to single out the vice president in apparent preparation for a potential switch of Democratic nominees. And on Thursday, the presumptive GOP nominee offered to\u00a0debate Biden one-on-one with without moderators.\u00a0\u201cI have the answer to the Crooked Joe Biden Incompetence Puzzle \u2014 Let\u2019s do another Debate, but this time, no holds barred - An all on discussion, with just the two of us on stage, talking about the future of our Country,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump has moved into a slight lead in several national polls following the debate, breaking out of what was for months a neck-and-neck race within the margin of error. The increasingly unpromising state of the Biden campaign has many Democrats worried \u2014 one reason the ABC News interview and a scheduled press conference at the NATO summit in Washington next week will be so crucial. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to take a very sober look at the reality of the race as it currently stands,\u201d California Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman said Thursday on \u201cCNN News Central.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one bad night; it was a bad night that may have locked in a really unfortunate narrative about President Biden\u2019s age and fitness, and that narrative could be very hard to undo,\u201d Huffman said. Spelling out a scenario that is chilling Democrats and that may soon bring concerns about Biden to a critical point, Huffman added: \u201cWe\u2019re four months before the election and the guy who\u2019s threatening our democracy, our fundamental rights in the free world right now is winning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/biden-july-4-reelection-pressure-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_democrats-donors-biden-election", "text": "President Joe Biden told top donors on a video call Monday that he is still the best candidate to defeat former President Donald Trump as the Biden campaign and the White House sought to move beyond a crisis threatening to consume the Democratic Party. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not going anywhere, folks,\u201d Biden said, according to a recording of the call obtained by CNN from a participant not authorized to release it. \u201cI am in this to the end, and I\u2019m going to beat Trump, I promise you.\u201d The president told participants that Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t waste any more time being distracted\u201d by the intraparty turmoil. \u201cWe\u2019re done talking about the debate. It\u2019s time to put Trump in the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go another day, another day, without explaining what he\u2019s doing, and we have to go after him.\u201d Biden\u2019s message echoed a defiant\u00a0Monday morning\u00a0letter he addressed to House Democrats\u00a0and an unscheduled appearance on MSNBC\u00a0in which\u00a0he discounted the conclusions of polls and pundits suggesting he could not deliver a victory in November. It\u2019s an open question whether the intense circling-of-the-wagons from the president and his campaign will ultimately ease the concerns of\u00a0Democratic donors and other party elders, who fear Biden\u2019s candidacy could inflict significant damage to the Democratic ticket in the fall. The president said it was time for Democrats to stop being distracted by his debate performance and questions about his fitness for office. He urged them to turn the focus back to drawing a sharp contrast with Trump. He cited Project 2025,\u00a0a policy playbook crafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation for a potential\u00a0second Trump term. Biden repeatedly portrayed Trump as a liar who has \u201cno sense of anything, except himself.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep using his language \u2013 what he said and how he said it and what he\u2019s going to do \u2013 and let him deny it. And then maybe he\u2019ll lose his own base,\u201d Biden said on the video call. Biden also made clear how damaging Trump\u2019s agenda would be across the board, including for the economy, women and the LGBTQ community, one\u00a0donor on the call\u00a0said. During the\u00a0Q&A\u00a0portion of the call, Biden fielded a question from a donor about what he needs to do in the second debate \u2013 currently scheduled for September 10 \u2013 to perform better than\u00a0he did in\u00a0the first debate,\u00a0during which\u00a051 million Americans watched his meandering and low-energy performance. Biden, dressed in a suit and flanked by an American flag and family photographs, said he would prepare differently for that debate, and would \u201cattack, attack, attack.\u201d It\u2019s far from certain\u00a0whether the ABC debate\u00a0will happen. Monday\u2019s call began roughly 40 minutes after its scheduled start time as the campaign processed a last-minute rush of RSVPs due to the late announcement of Biden\u2019s participation.\u00a0A participant told CNN that more\u00a0than 300 members of the campaign\u2019s National Finance Committee dialed into the Zoom call,\u00a0which opened with a fiery defense of the president from Maryland Gov. Wes Moore. Another participant on the call, who has been critical of Biden and his campaign over the past week, praised the president\u2019s words\u00a0Monday and said the campaign seemed to \u201cfinally\u201d grasp the seriousness of the moment. The ultimate test, this donor said, would be whether the battleground map showed any signs of expanding or if the president\u2019s support\u00a0erodes\u00a0in campaign polling expected later this week, following the long July\u00a04\u00a0holiday weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s still a huge hole to climb out of,\u201d the Democratic donor said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign. \u201cIt was already a steep hill to climb to victory.\u201d Concerns grow over Biden\u2019s future The\u00a0Biden\u00a0campaign has convened the National Finance Committee three times in the wake of the June 27 debate, which stirred acute concerns within the party about Biden\u2019s viability and questions about the future of his campaign\u2019s finances. Democratic National Committee Finance Chair Chris Korge, who was among the final speakers on the call, was \u201cbegging us to stay in line,\u201d one of the participants\u00a0said. One Wall Street donor said there continues to be \u201cplenty of noise\u201d agitating for an alternative among executives previously inclined to support Biden, but it remains \u201cunclear whether it will penetrate to the bunker,\u201d a reference to the insular group of longtime advisers who counsel the president most closely and have supported his decision to stay in the race. Biden\u2019s\u00a0defiant pledge to stay in the race has infuriated many of the campaign\u2019s biggest and most important contributors. The sense of alarm in the wake of his debate performance has turned into anger among some donors, particularly as the president has sought to tear into the \u201celites\u201d of the party. \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites,\u201d Biden said Monday morning during an impromptu call into \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC. One Democratic fundraiser said the president\u2019s tone was decidedly unhelpful and would only serve to drive donors away. The anger was one of the reasons campaign officials\u00a0arranged the lunchtime call with top donors Monday. While the Biden campaign\u00a0has\u00a0pointed to a rush of small-dollar donations over the\u00a0past\u00a0week, a senior adviser said the falloff among high-dollar contributors was highly troubling. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this without the money,\u201d the senior adviser said, noting\u00a0that\u00a0the campaign\u2019s budget of advertising, offices and staff was a\u00a0multimillion-dollar\u00a0proposition with little room for error. Even before the debate late last month in Atlanta, Biden campaign officials were growing increasingly concerned at\u00a0Trump\u2019s sudden burst of fundraising, which threatened to erase one of the biggest advantages Biden\u2019s campaign once held. An adviser to Democratic political contributors who has been on multiple donor calls in recent days \u2013 as well on the phone and texting with many individual donors \u2013 said fundraising typically slows in the summer. \u201cBut I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be hosting a Biden-Harris fundraiser this week, just with all the anxiety and uncertainty,\u201d the adviser said. The adviser said the donor class remains divided on the best path forward, although some increasingly are worried that the continued public handwringing by contributors over the future of the Democratic ticket is doing more harm than good. On a call this week that this person joined, one member of Congress reminded donors that the decision about withdrawing from the race was Biden\u2019s alone to make, the adviser recalled, with the lawmaker saying: \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to change horses when you are galloping down a stream, and it\u2019s really hard to change horses when you are galloping down a stream if the horse doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s sort of where we are at,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cThe polls being relatively stable have calmed a lot of people down.\u201d No \u2018cutting and running\u2019 John Morgan, a Florida trial attorney and longtime Biden supporter, had been working with the campaign to host a fundraiser in the state likely in early September, but he said the event is \u201call up in the air\u201d at this point. \u201cI don\u2019t even bother them,\u201d he said\u00a0about\u00a0reaching out to campaign officials\u00a0on\u00a0the status of the event. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call them because they have bigger fish to fry than an event in Florida in September. They\u2019ve got to get past all the naysayers.\u201d For his part, Morgan said he remains committed to backing Biden and is willing to hold a fundraiser \u201conly if he\u2019s the candidate.\u201d \u201cSome of the elite donor class is cutting and running. That\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Morgan said. Morgan blamed Biden\u2019s campaign team for his debate performance and argued that Vice President Kamala Harris is in place \u201cif something happens\u201d to Biden. He also warned that those urging the president to quit the race are underestimating the confusion and chaos that would follow. \u201cThe war that would ensue would be unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those politicians trying to get in line, all those political consultants, whose lifeblood and money comes from being tied to power.\u201d Moving forward, Morgan said, \u201cwhat I want President Biden to do is what he did over the weekend, which is go out and meet with people and be unscripted.\u201d Steve Phillips, a Democratic donor and author from San Francisco, said contributors calling for a Biden replacement\u00a0were\u00a0displaying \u201ca shocking amount of ignorance about electoral math and voter behavior.\u201d For starters, there\u2019s no realistic alternative to Biden, Phillips said. \u201cThere is just this widespread contagion of dissatisfaction and unrealistic pining for the perfect person. It\u2019s just not going to happen, and most importantly, it doesn\u2019t need to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a larger voting bloc for the Democrats than for the Republicans. And that\u2019s what people need to be focusing on.\u201d Phillips\u00a0said anxious Democratic donors \u201cneed to get out of their feelings\u201d and instead put their energy behind turning out those voters and selling them on the administration\u2019s accomplishments. He called it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to think that Democratic-leaning voters would \u201ceasily crumble, disappear and not show up\u201d on Election Day.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_trump-distance-project-2025", "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Friday sought to distance himself from a closely aligned conservative group\u2019s plans to radically reshape the federal government and American life should the former president win a second term. In a post\u00a0to his social media site, Trump claimed, \u201cI know nothing about Project 2025,\u201d the name given to a playbook crafted by the Heritage Foundation to fill the executive branch with thousands of Trump loyalists and reorient its many agencies\u2019 missions around conservative ideals. \u201cI have no idea who is behind it,\u201d Trump continued on Truth Social. \u201cI disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\u201d The post comes days after the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, drew widespread backlash from Democrats for saying in an interview that the country was \u201cin the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\u201d Project 2025 \u2014 widely viewed by conservatives as a blueprint for Trump\u2019s second term transition \u2014 is run by several former Trump administration officials and includes many policy priorities that are aligned with those of the former president, especially as they relate to cracking down on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracy by making it easier to dismiss civil servants and career officials. But it also includes controversial proposals Trump has not discussed, including banning pornography, reversing federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, excluding the morning-after pill and men\u2019s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, and making it harder for transgender adults to transition. Among the chief objectives of Project 2025, its authors wrote, is: \u201cRestore the family as the centerpiece of American life and protect our children.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 is not its official policy platform amid an intensifying effort by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie Trump to its more controversial policies. Yet those efforts are complicated by Trump\u2019s extremely close relationship with many of the people who launched Project 2025 or helped contribute to it. Paul Dans, the head of Project 2025, was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management during the Trump administration, and the group\u2019s roadmap for the next administration includes contributions from others who have worked for the former president, including his former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, former acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli and former deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn. John McEntee, Trump\u2019s former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office and one of his closest aides while in office, is also a senior adviser for the project. Trump himself told a gathering of religious broadcasters in February that Roberts was \u201cdoing an unbelievable job\u201d and \u201cbringing (Heritage) back to levels never seen.\u201d The remarks came at a Nashville conference shortly after Roberts and Dans both addressed the same crowd. Dans shared with the audience it was his intention to serve in a second Trump administration should the former president win in November. Speaking before Trump about Project 2025 that night, Roberts said, \u201cWe want no credit\u201d for the groundwork it is laying, and instead wanted \u201cPresident Trump and his administration to take credit for that.\u201d The group has long stated its transition project is a template they hope will be adopted by the next Republican president, something a Project 2025 spokeswoman reiterated in a statement to CNN. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been saying for more than two years now, Project 2025 does not speak for any candidate or campaign. We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president. But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement,\u201d the statement reads. A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN that Trump\u2019s post disavowing the group stemmed from a series of factors, most notably the Biden campaign\u2019s recent messaging campaign tying Trump to the project. Project 2025 has long frustrated Trump and his top advisers, who have been annoyed with the amount of coverage its policy platforms have received and the perception that the group is working in tandem with the campaign \u2014 despite Project 2025 partnering with a series of top Trump allies. The group\u2019s partners\u00a0include several leading conservative groups with close ties to Trump\u2019s campaign, including those who have been tapped by Trump\u2019s advisers to serve as part of their 2024 ground game strategy\u00a0in key battleground states, such as Turning Points USA. Other high-profile organizations partnered with Project 2025 include the Center for Renewing America, run by Trump\u2019s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, who is viewed by many in Trump\u2019s orbit as a likely contender for another Cabinet position in a second administration and is helping to lead the GOP platform committee ahead of the Republican National Convention later this month. The Conservative Partnership Institute, run in part by Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Sen. Jim Demint, and America Legal First, founded by his immigration adviser Stephen Miller, are also partners. The Biden campaign on Friday quickly dismissed Trump\u2019s attempts to keep Project 2025 at arm\u2019s length. \u200b\u200b\u201cProject 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump\u2019s second term that should scare the hell out of the American people,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cProject 2025 staff and leadership routinely tout their connections to Trump\u2019s team, and are the same people leading the RNC policy platform and Trump\u2019s debate prep, campaign, and inner circle.\u201d The Trump campaign has previously pushed back on reports about plans Trump\u2019s allies are looking to implement if Trump wins reelection. Trump\u2019s campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita issued a statement in November arguing that \u201creports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical\u201d and that no outside groups have the authority to speak on behalf of Trump or the campaign. LaCivita doubled down further on Friday, tweeting: \u201cPoke the Bear you are going to be bit\u201d while sharing an article titled: \u201cTrump torches Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/trump-distance-project-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters", "text": "With its immunity ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s wish of all but guaranteeing that his criminal trial for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election will not go to trial before the 2024 election in November. It also granted presidents in general a definitive \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution for core official acts and said presidents should be presumed immune for a much more expansive list of acts. In the view of the majority comprised of the six conservative justices on the court, the decision does not place presidents in general, and Trump in particular, above the law. But the three liberals dissented with a warning about how elevating a president will affect American democracy. The decision has the near-term result of delaying Trump\u2019s trial while a court in Washington, DC, considers which criminal activity that Trump is accused of can be considered \u201cunofficial.\u201d It also has the long-term effect of placing presidents in a different system of justice than other Americans. Here are key lines from a landmark ruling: What is this new immunity? Chief Justice John Roberts explains it in the majority opinion as including absolute immunity for some actions and a presumption of immunity for others. Why does a president need this immunity? So that he can act boldly as president and take actions without fear of later prosecution clouding his judgement, according to the court. Here\u2019s Roberts: What does it say in the Constitution about presidents getting special immunity? Nothing. But that\u2019s no problem, according to Roberts. How far does this immunity extend? A president gets \u201cat least a presumptive immunity\u201d even for acts \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,\u201d according to the court. But it\u2019s careful to add that he gets no immunity for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2013 and despite the broad reach of the immunity, the court argues presidents are still accountable. Are any of the things Trump is accused of in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment outside this blanket of immunity? During oral arguments in the case back in April, Trump\u2019s attorney, John Sauer, told Justice Amy Coney Barrett that multiple elements of the indictment would indeed be \u201cprivate,\u201d or unofficial, acts. These include, for instance, getting an outside attorney to organize slates of false electors. Barrett, in a concurring opinion on Monday, said she would make clear in the decision what was official versus unofficial. But the majority takes no position and wants the trial court to go through the allegations individually. Trump can then appeal whatever the trial court decides. Here\u2019s Roberts: Does the majority tell the trial court what might be official or not? The majority gives quite a bit of detail. Trump has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for any instructions or pressure he exerted on his acting attorney general, for instance. Plus, the court won\u2019t allow as evidence any interviews with people who worked in the administration (nullifying much of the evidence gathered by the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, events). And it also won\u2019t let a court consider a president\u2019s motives for taking an action. It\u2019s an open question for the lower court to decide if Trump\u2019s pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to disregard the 2020 election results involved \u201cofficial conduct,\u201d but the Supreme Court put that pressure in the \u201cpresumptively immune\u201d category. The majority thinks Trump\u2019s tweets encouraging people to go to the Capitol and pressure Pence are within the \u201couter perimeter of his official responsibilities,\u201d but they\u2019re not sure and they expect it will be challenging for the lower court to muddle through these questions. Why can\u2019t a jury make these decisions? Juries can\u2019t even consider official acts in terms of a prosecution, according to the Supreme Court. So the Supreme Court gave Trump everything he wanted? It certainly embraced Trump\u2019s theory of immunity and pretty much guaranteed the trial will not happen before the election, although the majority says they were restrained since they rejected his request to completely dismiss the case. So there is a special system of justice for presidents? The president is more than a person, according to Roberts. The majority dismisses warnings about a president operating above the laws as \u201cfear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals.\u201d It\u2019s more important to protect the president from political prosecutions, the court says. Roberts borrows from Trump\u2019s attorneys when he quotes George Washington\u2019s farewell address, in which he warns about factions. The problem with that particular quote, as I found earlier this year, is that Washington also warned about elevating a person above the law. Does the court mention the politics of today? Roberts says the court\u2019s considerations are more far-reaching than what\u2019s happening at the moment. Did it say anything about Smith? The majority did not weigh in on the brewing argument among conservatives that Smith should not even have a job and that his role as a special counsel is unconstitutional. But Justice Clarence Thomas endorsed the idea in a concurring opinion. What did Barrett say about alternate electors? Barrett, a Trump appointee, wrote her own concurrence in which she disagreed with the majority on some key points. She said they could easily have expressed that some of Trump\u2019s conduct was unofficial. What was in the blistering dissent? Writing for the three liberals on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the majority as inventing an \u201catextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.\u201d She said the court makes it difficult to imagine what might be \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct on the part of the president. The majority \u201cpays lip service\u201d to the idea that presidents are not above the law \u201cbut it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.\u201d How far does Sotomayor say presidents can now go? As far as they want, she says.

{"id": "2024_07_07_politics_house-democrats-biden-out", "text": "More than a handful of House Democratic ranking members told House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a Sunday call that President Joe Biden needs to step aside from the 2024 campaign, according to sources familiar with the call. Jeffries held the call to take the temperature of ranking members after Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance last month. The call, held before lawmakers return to Washington this week, was filled with deep concern about potential damage to the Democratic ticket and how it imperils the party\u2019s chances to win back the House majority. Jeffries\u00a0did not share with his colleagues where he stands on the question of whether Biden should continue running for reelection, a source who was on the call told CNN. The number of lawmakers who explicitly said Biden should not be the Democratic nominee was greater than the number who spoke up for him to stay, according to one of the sources. Among those who opposed Biden as the nominee were Reps. Mark Takano, Adam Smith, Jim Himes, Joe Morelle, Jerry Nadler and Susan Wild, according to three sources. Five lawmakers have publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race: Reps. Lloyd Doggett, Seth Moulton, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Angie Craig and Mike Quigley. Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters and Bobby Scott spoke in support of Biden, according to one of the sources. One of the concerns expressed during the nearly two-hour call was that Democrats will lose their chance at the House majority if Biden is the candidate, one of the sources said, adding that it was generally acknowledged the nominee should be Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cIt was pretty brutal,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation among House leaders. Though not present on the call, lawmakers from the Congressional Black Caucus, including Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida, were quick to defend Biden from their colleagues calling on the president to step aside. Beatty, former chair of the CBC, said that Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be going rogue against our own president\u201d and that Black voters are loyal and will continue to support Biden. \u201cAny \u2018leader\u2019 calling for President Biden to drop out needs to get their priorities straight and stop undermining this incredible actual leader who has delivered real results for our country,\u201d Wilson said in a statement. No decisions about demands for a White House meeting or sending a letter to Biden are expected to be made before the full Democratic caucus meets Tuesday, aides said, but Jeffries has made clear he will allow members to speak their minds and make their own judgments. One senior House Democrat said they have been on calls and group chats with dozens of their colleagues where the consensus is that Biden needs to step aside. The member said the caucus is trying to \u201cfind the best way to move forward\u201d while still giving the president the respect they believe he deserves for his storied career. It is the view of the senior House Democrat and another member that Tuesday \u2014 the day of the planned caucus meeting \u2014 will be the most consequential day for the president this week. One of the members told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Many Democrats concerned about Biden\u2019s viability as a candidate following his poor debate performance are waiting for Jeffries to take a public position. So far, the leader has been in a purposeful listening mode \u2014 as one person told CNN last week, Jeffries has \u201cassiduously\u201d avoided sharing his own judgment on the matter as he continues to survey his own caucus. Biden, meanwhile, was busy on the campaign trail in battleground Pennsylvania, speaking earlier in the day at a predominantly Black church in Philadelphia before making a surprise stop at a local campaign office \u2014 amping up the unscripted and off-the-cuff events his allies have encouraged him to take on. He then made his way to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he showed off his support from state Democrats Sen. John\u00a0Fetterman, Rep. Madeleine Dean and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis at a campaign event. It was between those trips on Sunday that Biden answered with a resounding \u201cyes\u201d when press asked whether the Democratic Party was still behind him.

{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_biden-doctor-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden\u00a0was examined by his physician in the days following last week\u2019s CNN presidential debate, the White House tells CNN \u2014 despite the White House press secretary\u00a0having said Wednesday\u00a0that the president has had no medical exams since his February physical. \u201cSeveral days later, the president was seen to check on his cold and was recovering well,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates said. On Wednesday, CNN had asked Karine Jean-Pierre in the White House press briefing whether the president had received \u201cany medical exams\u201d since his February physical, and the press secretary had responded: \u201cWe were able to talk to his doctor about that and that is a no.\u201d A White House official adds when Biden was seen by his doctor after the debate, it was a \u201cbrief check,\u201d not a \u201cphysical.\u201d CNN on Wednesday did not ask Jean-Pierre whether Biden had had another physical since February, but rather,\u00a0any medical examination. Politico\u00a0first\u00a0reported that Biden told more than 20 Democratic governors in a private meeting Wednesday night that he underwent a medical checkup after last week\u2019s debate and is fine. The White House\u2019s explanation Thursday that Jean-Pierre said Biden had not had any medical exams since February because she was drawing a distinction between the president being checked out by his doctor and receiving a formal \u201cphysical\u201d does not\u00a0appear to\u00a0explain a different exchange from the same briefing\u00a0on Wednesday. Jean-Pierre was asked by a\u00a0reporter to clarify\u00a0whether the president had been checked out by his doctor around the debate given that he had a cold. \u201cHe was on the way to the debate, the doctor was with him, he had a cold, he\u2019s 81. Does he not get checked out by the doctor?\u201d the reporter asked. \u201cHe did not get checked out by the doctor. It\u2019s a cold, guys. It\u2019s a cold.\u201d she said. \u201cI know that it affects everybody differently. We\u2019ve all had colds, and so no, he was not checked out by the doctor.\u201d In a briefing with reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Jean-Pierre cast Biden\u2019s check-in as \u201ca conversation\u201d with his doctor, Kevin O\u2019Connor. \u201cSo he did have a short verbal check-in in the recent days about his cold. It wasn\u2019t a medical exam or physical, just want to be super, super clear about that. It was a conversation and his doctor didn\u2019t think an examination was necessary,\u201d Jean-Pierre said Questions\u00a0about Biden\u2019s fitness for office and ability to seek a second term have swirled since his stunningly halting debate performance at last week\u2019s CNN\u00a0presidential debate. CNN reported Thursday that Biden privately acknowledged to an ally earlier this week that the next stretch of days are critical as to whether he can save his reelection bid. The White House and campaign have insisted the president is not considering ending his campaign. Asked about concerns about Biden\u2019s age, top advisers have repeatedly and emphatically cited his aggressive schedules during international travel as examples of his vitality and capacity to do the job at 81. The president\u2019s new explanation this week that he performed badly at the debate this week because of the grueling foreign travel before the debate \u2013 despite having had nearly two weeks back in the states before facing off against Donald Trump \u2013 has undercut that argument. Jean-Pierre did not mention travel fatigue and jet lag as factors for Biden\u2019s poor debate performance in Tuesday\u2019s White House briefing. On Wednesday, pressed by CNN on why she had failed to mention those issues, she\u00a0blamed her focus on Biden\u2019s cold. \u201cI was so focused on the call \u2013 on the cold \u2013 and that\u2019s what I kind of leaned into and talked about, but yes, his schedule did have something to do with it. It was the schedule and the cold.\u00a0And I did \u2013\u00a0I was aware of that yesterday,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_trump-tax-cuts-tcja-wealthy-benefit", "text": "The highest-income households would receive more than 45% of the benefits if the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are extended, according to an analysis released Monday by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The tax cut law was a key accomplishment of former President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, but the individual and certain business tax provisions are set to expire at the end of next year. Trump has promised to extend them if he is returned to the White House in November\u2019s election. If the law\u2019s provisions are made permanent, households making at least around $450,000 \u2013 roughly the top 5% \u2013 would be the biggest winners, the analysis found. They would see their after-tax income increase by 3.2%. For those in the top 1%, who make at least $1 million, that equates to a tax cut of about $70,000, on average, in 2027. The top 0.1%, who make at least $5 million, would pocket a tax cut of nearly $280,000, on average, or about 3% of their after-tax income. Middle-income households earning between roughly $65,000 and $116,000, on the other hand, would receive a tax cut of about $1,000, or 1.3% of their income. Overall, extending the 2017 tax law would reduce taxes for about three-quarters of households, but hike them for about 10%, according to the analysis. Big debate expected Addressing the expiring provisions will be a contentious issue in Congress next year. Trump and many Republican lawmakers want to extend the tax cuts, saying they have helped spur economic growth. But President Joe Biden and many congressional Democrats have said they would allow the measures benefitting those earning more than $400,000 to lapse, arguing that the law disproportionately helped the rich. \u201cThere is much we still need to learn about how the candidates would address the looming expiration of many key provisions of the TCJA,\u201d Harold Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in a post. \u201cBut one thing is clear: While extending the law as is would benefit most taxpayers, the biggest winners would be those making $450,000 or more.\u201d Complicating matters is that extending the provisions would have a big impact on the national debt, raising it by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years \u2013 before interest costs are factored in, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The TCJA contained a bevy of individual income and corporate tax reductions, making it one of the largest tax cut packages in US history. Unlike the individual tax provisions, most of the corporate measures are permanent. Some of the key provisions that expire at the end of 2025 include: the reduction of individual income tax rates, notably the top rate of 37%, down from 39.6%; the near doubling of the standard deduction; the doubling of the annual child tax credit to $2,000 and allowing more higher-income parents to claim it, and the essential doubling of the estate and gift tax exemption. In addition, the law temporarily created a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns. The deduction, which also expires at the end of 2025, allows these taxpayers to exclude up to 20% of their business income from their federal income tax. These so-called pass-through businesses include partnerships, such as those formed by lawyers, doctors or investors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/trump-tax-cuts-tcja-wealthy-benefit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_democrats-biden-congress-what-matters", "text": "Democrats\u2019 collective freakout over the fitness of President Joe Biden hinges first and foremost on his ability to beat former President Donald Trump. But in the distressed comments of lawmakers and strategists lurks the additional fact that the House and Senate are also up for grabs in November \u2013 and if voters turn on Biden, it could reverberate across the country and hand Republicans unified control of the federal government. Damage control measures from the White House and Biden campaign are coming In an effort to prove Biden can still think on his feet, he\u2019ll meet the press and interact with lawmakers \u2013 things, shockingly, he has not already done in the wake of last week\u2019s debate. There are plans for a meeting with nervous Democratic governors this week; an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News, with clips to be aired at the end of the week; and a Biden-hosted press conference during next week\u2019s NATO summit. Lawmaker calls on president to drop out with nod to Biden drag The first evidence of actual fracture among Democrats is already here. It appeared on Tuesday when Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a longtime Democratic congressman from Texas, became the first elected Democrat at the national level to reluctantly call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. Doggett appealed to Biden\u2019s sense of patriotism in a statement and noted that Biden is underperforming Democratic candidates for Senate in key states around the country. Incumbent presidents are supposed leave coattails for down-ballot candidates to ride in their wake. For Democrats this year, even before Biden\u2019s bad debate performance, the opposite was true. Biden may be a drag on Democrats\u2019 already long prospects to keep the Senate. Senate majority is at risk With a 51-49 majority, Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) have a tenuous hold on power in the Senate and are on defense in multiple consequential races. Twenty-three seats currently held by Democrats are on the line in November compared with 11 held by Republicans. One Democratic seat, currently held by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 who is not running for reelection and left the Democratic Party to register as an independent \u2013 is likely to move to the Republican column. Implications for decades Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, did not call on Biden to withdraw from the race, but he did point out that the president\u2019s decision on whether to continue his campaign will have implications that extend well beyond the presidency and his own personal legacy. \u201cHis decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come,\u201d Quigley said. In the House, Democrats could be within striking distance of a majority since Republicans currently hold only a slight 219-213 majority. \u2018Team sport,\u2019 and Biden needs help Biden\u2019s old boss, former President Barack Obama, appeared at a New York City fundraiser last Friday alongside Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the New Yorker and top Democrat in the House who Democrats would very much like to be speaker. Obama said general elections are like a \u201cteam sport\u201d and the president is captain, according to CNN\u2019s report, but in this case voters should be motivated by down-ballot races. \u201cWe need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d The not-so-subtle implication there is that Biden will need to be propped up by other Democrats in order to win. Fearing a \u2018MAGA trifecta\u2019 The Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator Paul Begala predicted on Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d that pressure on Biden is only just beginning since lawmakers are headed home to talk to their constituents over the July Fourth holiday. \u201cI think voters are going to say, are you out of your mind? Because Democrats are worried that not only will Biden lose to Trump, but that he\u2019ll drag down the House and the Senate as well. And you\u2019ll have a MAGA trifecta \u2013 which Mr. Trump himself says will be a dictatorship, at least for a day,\u201d Begala told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Presidents are more productive in periods of unified government Recent presidents have made their most lasting marks during periods of unified government, usually at the outset of their presidencies. It was when Democrats controlled the House, Senate and White House during his first two years in office that Biden signed the massive Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the PACT Act to improve care for veterans and more. It was when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House during his first two years in office that Trump signed some permanent corporate tax cuts into law. The Affordable Care Act under Obama? Unified government. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which turns 60 years old on Tuesday? Unified government. Granted, neither party is likely to have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate to easily pass major and sweeping legislation. But certainly controlling the elected portions of the federal government creates an environment for productivity. There has been lots of reporting about how Trump and his supporters will be better prepared to change the nature of government if they are to win in November. With the House and Senate, they could make more priorities permanent. \u2018Just sit there and be Joe\u2019 Even party stalwarts on the level of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose main goal for decades has been winning and keeping the House, said Biden must prove to Democrats and voters that he is still up to the job. She recommended he give a series of interviews or town halls. \u201cJust sit there and be Joe,\u201d Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday. \u201cShow your values, show your knowledge, show your judgment.\u201d But Pelosi also said of Biden\u2019s debate performance that it is a \u201clegitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition.\u201d While she quickly added that this was a legitimate question for Trump as well, citing his repeated lies during the debate, that\u2019s far from an unqualified endorsement of his ability to be president \u2013 and she said both Trump and Biden could stand to take a cognitive test of some kind. \u201cBoth candidates owe whatever test you want to put them to, in terms of their mental acuity and their health \u2013 both of them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/democrats-biden-congress-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_parkinsons-specialist-white-house", "text": "A top Parkinson\u2019s disease specialist held a meeting with President Joe Biden\u2019s physician at the White House earlier this year, according to records, though the circumstances of the meeting are unclear. Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, met with White House physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor at the White House in mid-January, according to White House visitor logs. Cannard has visited the White House three times this year, according to the visitor logs: A January 17 meeting with O\u2019Connor, and with another staffer on January 26 and March 28. Cannard has visited the White House at least eight times over the past year, according to the logs, beginning last August and ending with the March 28 meeting. Only the January 17 meeting lists O\u2019Connor as the person who was visited. Asked about the visit between Cannard and O\u2019Connor, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, \u201cA\u00a0wide variety of specialists from the Walter Reed system visit the White House complex to treat the thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds.\u201d Those visits include one from a neurologist each year for Biden\u2019s physical, Bates said. Biden has not been seen by a neurologist during his time as president outside the context of his annual physical, he added. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later repeated Biden had been seen by a neurologist three times during his presidency \u2013 once during each of his physicals \u2013 but declined to name them or explain why Cannard had visited the White House eight times over the past year. She said she wouldn\u2019t name the specialist due to security reasons. Publicly available profiles name Cannard as a neurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit. \u201cI am not sharing, confirming names from here,\u201d she said during the news briefing, which quickly became contentious as Jean-Pierre deflected questions about the president\u2019s health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how hard you push me, it doesn\u2019t matter how angry you get with me, I\u2019m not going to confirm a name, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s even in the log, I am not going to do that from here.\u201d Jean-Pierre added Biden has never been treated for, or taken any medicine to treat, Parkinson\u2019s. Cannard \u2014 who\u2019s worked as a neurologist for Walter Reed for more than a decade \u2014 has visited the White House multiple times,\u00a0according to the visitor logs, which don\u2019t detail the reasons for the visit, including whether Cannard was visiting in reference to Biden or another person who works at the White House. Biden\u2019s latest health report, released by O\u2019Connor, indicated the president had been screened for a number of neurological conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s, with negative results, as did two other physical reports from Biden\u2019s time as president. The six-page letter from O\u2019Connor, released after the president underwent his last physical in February, says several specialists consulted on the physical, including a neurological specialist. It later says O\u2019Connor convened several specialists, including an unnamed movement-disorder neurologic specialist, to review Biden\u2019s stiffened gait, which had been noted since Biden\u2019s November 2021 physical. That team concluded Biden\u2019s stiff gait was the result of \u201cwear and tear\u201d on his spine and not a neurological condition, O\u2019Connor wrote. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d exam resulted in no findings consistent with Parkinson\u2019s, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological disorders. News of the visit by Cannard comes as Biden\u2019s age, fitness and mental acuity have been under intense scrutiny following his faltering June 27 presidential debate performance against former President Donald Trump. In the 11 days since that performance, Biden has had to defend his position on the top of the Democratic ticket and his ability to govern for another four years if he is reelected. Both the White House and Biden have repeatedly been asked about tests and doctors visits in the months before the debate and the moments after.  Biden was asked in an ABC interview on Friday whether he had taken specific tests for cognitive capability. The president responded by saying he is regularly seen by White House doctors and added, \u201cNo one said I had to \u2026 they said I\u2019m good.\u201d The president also added that he spoke with his doctor and was told, \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Biden said, \u201cBeing president\u201d means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d Speaking with Biden during an interview Monday morning, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski asked Biden specifically whether he had undergone any recent tests for Parkinson\u2019s. Biden confirmed he had. \u201cHave you been tested for any age-related illness, pre-Parkinson\u2019s or anything like that, that might explain sort of having a night like that where you couldn\u2019t finish sentences?\u201d the MSNBC host asked. Biden laughed before responding: \u201cI had before.\u201d The president added: \u201cI was feeling so badly before the debate, when I came back, they tested me for - I thought maybe I had COVID, maybe there was something wrong, I had an infection or something. They tested me, they gave me those tests, I was clear.\u201d The White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed Biden\u2019s poor performance during the debate on his packed travel schedule in the weeks before \u2013 Biden went to France to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day and Italy to attend the G7 \u2013 and a cold. The White House initially said Biden wasn\u2019t seen by a doctor after the debate, but then reversed after Biden told a group of governors during a meeting last week that he underwent a medical checkup after the debate and is fine.

{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_lbj-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, according to CNN\u2019s latest report. He remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision. Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here\u2019s part of that address: It is a remarkable speech to watch today. Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded. By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson\u2019s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted. Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16. Health was a concern for LBJ Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term. \u201cThere\u2019s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,\u201d Updegrove said. \u201cHe had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn\u2019t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,\u201d Updegrove added. A year of incredible uncertainty 1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson\u2019s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty. Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities. In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent. If Biden decides to step aside this year, Democrats should study what happened in 1968, when they ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside. In November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states. Johnson remains one of the country\u2019s most transformative presidents Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a \u201cgreat society,\u201d including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty. Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/lbj-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_biden-fate-political-career", "text": "The high-stakes week ahead is critical to whether President Joe Biden\u2019s defiance will save his reelection bid or whether Democrats who question his capacity to serve a second term will succeed in pressuring him to step aside. While only a handful of House Democrats have\u00a0publicly called for the president to end his campaign, there is deep disquiet inside the party at the possibility that Biden, who swept\u00a0Donald Trump out of the White House four years ago, could ruin his legacy\u00a0and throw the country into uncharted political territory by\u00a0failing to deter voters from sending\u00a0his rival back in the Oval Office after November\u2019s election. Biden on Monday emphatically said he was staying in the race. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter to congressional Democrats. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Democratic anxiety reverberated through a call that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hosted for his conference Sunday afternoon. Some members said Biden should go, and there\u2019s a consensus among dozens of party lawmakers that he needs to step aside, sources told CNN. But a meeting that Sen. Mark Warner planned for Monday to consider the president\u2019s future is now scrapped, and the Virginia Democrat has not decided whether he thinks Biden should step aside, a source said. Several key party heavyweights said on Sunday morning news shows that the president needs to do far more to ease skepticism among voters. \u201cI think this week is going to be really critical for him to answer those remaining questions,\u201d Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The president nevertheless insisted in a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania on Sunday that \u201cI\u2019m up for the job!\u201d Biden reinforced his refusal to cede the Democratic nomination he earned through a largely unopposed primary run in a high-stakes interview with ABC News on Friday, warning only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could compel him to end his campaign. But the interview only reinforced Democrats\u2019 panic that followed his devastating debate performance last month over his chances of beating Republican presumptive nominee Trump. The interview also raised further questions over Biden\u2019s health as he seeks a new term that would end when he is 86 and over whether he understands the gravity of his political plight as he trails Trump in polls. The turmoil surrounding Biden\u2019s future is creating a grim mood inside the White House, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee reported. West Wing staffers are rattled by the president\u2019s debate performance and the coverage of the president\u2019s subsequent struggles, although support for his reelection bid remains strong in the building. A moment of soul-searching for the Democratic Party Among the key questions now is whether a critical mass of lawmakers will unite to try to convince the president to stand aside. \u2022 If that happens, would senior party leaders be willing to go to the\u00a0president\u00a0and argue that his position is unsustainable?\u2022 And even if they did, would Biden \u2013 who has earned the votes of millions of Democrats to secure the nomination and who maintains he is fully fit to serve a new term\u00a0\u2013\u00a0agree to cede his campaign?\u2022 If the president remained obdurate at this point, Democrats would face a decision on whether to go public about their views, and many in critical states and districts would have to consider distancing themselves from their own party\u2019s presidential nominee to try to save themselves in November. There is an almost surreal quality to the frenzied political debate as Biden digs in. It would be an extraordinary twist to an already remarkable year in which Republicans will nominate a convicted felon and\u00a0twice-impeached former president if Democrats decline at the last minute to nominate a sitting president, who most believe has had a successful term,\u00a0over concerns that he can\u2019t win. Passing on Biden would also\u00a0mark\u00a0a humiliating coda to a political career that has spanned half a century, and the president would likely regard himself as the victim of scathing betrayal. If Democrats do push him aside, they\u2019d create a high-risk scenario unprecedented in modern history. They\u2019d have to decide whether to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 which has already begun in some quarters \u2013 or whether to stage a lightning process to pick an unvetted neophyte new nominee. There would be no guarantee that a new standard-bearer would do better than Biden, who has already beaten Trump once. But the fact many want to try shows the intensity of alarm in the party and the potency of the image of an aged and sometimes incoherent president blazed on the minds of 50 million television viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta. In a worrying sign for Biden, even senior party figures who are normally supportive and laud the achievements of his term argue that he must do far more to convince voters that he is up to the demands of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the president\u2019s performance at the debate has raised questions for voters, not questions about his character or his decency or who he cares about or who he fights for, but questions as to whether this is still the old Joe Biden,\u201d Murphy said on\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0\u201cState of the Union.\u201d He told Dana Bash that the president needed to get out and \u201cdo a town hall, that he do a press conference,\u00a0(to) show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden.\u201d Rep. Adam\u00a0Schiff also raised concerns. Like Murphy, Schiff poured praise on Biden\u2019s achievements and lacerated Trump. But he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the debate performance raised concerns among voters about whether Biden had the capacity to win \u201can existential race.\u201d Given that Trump is a convicted criminal, the California Democrat said that the election shouldn\u2019t be close and that the president\u2019s age is the only reason it is. \u201cHe should seek out people with some distance and objectivity. He should seek pollsters who are not his own pollsters. He should take a moment to make the best-informed judgment. And if the judgment is run, then run hard and beat that SOB.\u201d The comments of the two senior Democrats underscore the disconnect in the party. While there is alarm among many on Capitol Hill and a desire for the president to do far more in unscripted situations to prove his fitness, Biden himself has already ruled out ending his reelection bid. He refused to answer a question in the ABC News interview about what he would do if leaders such as Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told him that he could harm Democrats in Congress if he stayed in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Biden said. But the president is getting strong support from his allies in the Congressional Black Caucus.\u00a0Ohio\u00a0Rep. Joyce\u00a0Beatty, a former chair of the CBC, said Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be going rogue against our own president.\u201d And voters at the Essence Festival in New Orleans voiced confidence in Biden and resisted calls for him to end his campaign, CNN\u2019s Ebony Davis and Eva McKend reported. The\u00a0ABC News interview aside, the president is not throwing himself into the intense scrutiny of repeated and spontaneous political events that even many of his supporters want to see. On Sunday, the president gave a speech in a Black church in Philadelphia and addressed campaign workers in a short, off-the-cuff speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He did spend considerable time working a rope line in stifling heat. And later this week, he\u2019s expected to hold a news conference at the NATO summit he\u2019s hosting in Washington, which will be another critical barometer of his faculties. But many Democrats want him to do more amid fears that his position is so precarious that he will not only lose the White House but that he could also drag down his party, allowing Republicans to win back the House and retain the Senate. With the Supreme Court cementing an era of ultra-conservative jurisprudence, many Democrats are openly scared of the consequences of a second, unrestrained Trump presidency. House Democrats on Sunday vented their frustration about Biden\u2019s troubles and the impact they could have on winning back the House, a possibility that many members had been optimistic about until the debate. \u201cIt was pretty brutal,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation among House leaders. No decisions about demands for a White House meeting or about the possibility of sending a letter to Biden are expected to be made before the full Democratic caucus meets Tuesday, aides said. A source who was on the Sunday call told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee that Jeffries has not taken a position on what should happen. But the Tuesday meeting looms as a fateful moment for the president. Concern about Biden\u2019s ability to perform on the campaign trail and the long-term implications of the debate remain deep, despite the legacy of a first term in which his legislative record matches or surpasses that of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson. Rep. Gerry Connolly, for instance, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Saturday that he believed what happened was more than \u201ca bad night, and that\u2019s why that image is so indelible on so many minds.\u201d The Virginia Democrat said that while Biden\u2019s performance in the ABC News interview was largely good, there were some troubling aspects. \u201cInvoking God Almighty as the only intervention that is going to dissuade him from going forward, I hope Joe Biden didn\u2019t really mean that,\u201d Connolly said. Biden hits the trail Biden sought to squash speculation about his future by seeking to project a picture of vigor on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, a state that he must keep in his column in November to keep his hopes of victory alive. The president reflected on faith and the trials it can help surmount at a stop at Philadelphia\u2019s Mount Airy Church of God in Christ. \u201cWe\u2019re all imperfect beings. We don\u2019t know where or what faith will deliver us to or when,\u201d he said, while appearing to read from prepared notes. Black Democratic voters helped to rescue Biden\u2019s primary campaign in 2020 and to put him in the White House. He has been beset by polls in this cycle suggesting Trump is making inroads in a community that usually votes overwhelming for Democratic presidential candidates. Later in the day, Biden moved on to the state capital of Harrisburg, in the company of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a\u00a0Democratic\u00a0rising star\u00a0spoken of as a possible alternative nominee. Biden also traveled with Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, one of the most vehement supporters of his continued reelection campaign, and his old friend Sen. Bob Casey, who is in a tough reelection race, completed the impression of the commonwealth\u2019s top Democrats protecting his back. \u201cThis election is going to be about blocking, tackling simple, basic politics, simple. It\u2019s going to be a matter of how many signs we get out, how many doors we knock on, how many calls we make and how many requests we answer,\u201d Biden told supporters. His campaign has already announced that he plans to campaign in another vital swing state, Michigan, on Friday, following\u00a0this week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington. Hosting world leaders will allow Biden to highlight his credentials as a statesman and one of the most significant aspects of his term \u2014 his reinvigoration and expansion of the Western alliance and the steeling of US allies to meet the threat posed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. If he can successfully navigate the event without more controversy, the focus may begin to turn away from his perceived liabilities and back toward Trump, who is expected to unveil his vice presidential nominee at or ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. By the time Biden is back in the spotlight, there will be even less time ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August for his critics to push any alternative nominee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/biden-fate-political-career/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_dnc-delegates-biden-loyalty", "text": "Democrats urging President Joe Biden to end his campaign and allow the party to select another nominee before \u2013 or during \u2013 August\u2019s national convention are unlikely to find allies in the ranks of Chicago-bound delegates, who are increasingly closing ranks around Biden. Ten days after the president\u2019s debate debacle, following an initial surge of Democratic anxiety and calls for him to stand down, a host of party leaders and rank-and-file members selected to formally nominate Biden said they were loath to consider any other option. For many of the more than two dozen delegates interviewed by CNN over the last 48 hours, the debate remains a sore subject. Though a few sought to cast Biden\u2019s performance as an untimely aberration, most argued that, despite the angst they and so many others felt watching the president struggle, the tumult that\u2019s followed is a distraction from the party\u2019s unifying aim: To defeat former President Donald Trump in November and crush the most ambitious plans of his right-wing loyalists. Their concerns over the prospect of Biden bowing out are twofold. A host of pledged delegates warned that the process for replacing the president \u2013 should he relinquish the nomination and release his delegates \u2013 would do more damage than even the worst-case scenario with Biden atop the ticket. Most, though, refused to even consider the hypothetical \u2013 a mark of both their belief in the president and, going back months, the Biden campaign\u2019s work to screen for loyal delegates. Biden-aligned delegates also expressed, often privately, a lack of confidence in the alternatives, arguing that Biden, for all the agita following the debate, remains a better bet than any of the names whipping around the gossip circuit. To the extent they were willing to countenance a succession plan, there was overwhelming support for Vice President Kamala Harris, who \u2013 both as a logistical and political matter \u2013 would in their views likely encounter the fewest roadblocks. For the most part, though, Biden\u2019s most ardent delegates were singing from the same hymn sheet. Chris Anderson, chair of the delegate selection process in Tennessee and a local government official, argued \u2013 as Biden\u2019s campaign has done \u2013 that voters aren\u2019t as interested in the president\u2019s debate performance as the political media. \u201cThe punditry class has a job to do, and I understand that, but they seem to think the debate was a bigger deal than regular people think it was because most regular people were focused on the 90 minutes of lies spewed by Donald Trump,\u201d Anderson said. Stephen Gaskill, the former president of the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus, told CNN he had no plans to look any further into his responsibilities as a delegate. Like so many others, he acknowledged that Biden flopped on the debate stage in Atlanta, but said he was not entertaining the idea of a candidate swap. \u201cThere is no plan B. The president is the nominee,\u201d Gaskill said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I and everyone that I\u2019ve been talking to stands \u2013 until and unless he says otherwise. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.\u201d Colorado state Rep. Meg Froelich said she found the post-debate narrative \u201cfrustrating\u201d given the stark differences between Biden and Trump, who was convicted of 34 felony counts earlier this year in New York and faces three other criminal indictments. \u201cThis whole idea that someone\u2019s going to ride in on a white horse and unify everyone, and we\u2019re all going to get excited \u2026 Biden is our nominee,\u201d said Froelich, who also praised Harris. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem supporting him.\u201d In Massachusetts, Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo \u2014 who helped organize a write-in campaign for Biden in New Hampshire because he wasn\u2019t on the primary ballot after a calendar dispute \u2014 said he was exasperated by the relentless focus on Biden\u2019s missteps. \u201cThe debate performance obviously could have been better, significantly better,\u201d Caiazzo said. \u201cAnd I think that it was clear that the narrative coming out of the debate would be more about Joe Biden\u2019s performance than what Donald Trump actually said.\u201d He also questioned the motives of some of the voices calling for Biden to quit. \u201cThere are people in the party who are looking for a reason to sideline Biden from the beginning,\u201d Caiazzo said, \u201cwhich was clear through my work on the write-in effort.\u201d Delegates willing to go public with their calls for Biden to drop out have typically been less closely tied to the campaign and Democratic Party infrastructure. Rishi Kumar, a Biden delegate from California and former Saratoga City councilmember, said he began researching Democratic National Committee rules for replacing a candidate a year ago. \u201cThe process is probably as clear as mud right now,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThe DNC committee will have to come up with a plan, whether Biden drops out before or at the convention or even after.\u201d The debate was an \u201ceye opener,\u201d he said, and Biden\u2019s interview with ABC News broadcast on Friday didn\u2019t help. Kumar, who ran for retiring Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo\u2019s Silicon Valley House seat but did not advance out of the primary, said he was worried down-ballot Democrats would be political \u201croadkill\u201d if Biden didn\u2019t exit the race. \u201cWith so many vulnerable Democrats who are running in the House and Senate, those seats might be up for grabs if Biden becomes the roadblock,\u201d said Kumar, who told CNN that he would back California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the presidential nomination if the opportunity arose. Biden and his campaign began a blitz of personal outreach after the initial shock of the debate subsided, trying to lock down support with party leaders \u2013 including governors and members of Congress \u2013 whose decisions could pave the way for others to register their concerns. They have also hammered a public message that a faceless blob of Democratic \u201celites\u201d is trying to step over the will of primary voters. \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites,\u201d a combative Biden said during a call-in to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday. \u201cThey know so much more. But if any of these guys don\u2019t think I should run \u2013 run against me. Good. Announce \u2014 announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d So far, six Democratic House members have publicly asked Biden to stand down. A handful  \u2013 most in senior positions \u2013 said the same during a weekend call with the party\u2019s House leadership, according to sources briefed on the discussion. That number could grow on Tuesday, when House lawmakers hold their first caucus meeting with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries since the debate. Though one member told CNN the dam could break soon after that gathering, most Democratic elected officials, activists and delegates have, so far, been careful not to be seen speaking out of school. There is also a concerted \u2013 if decentralized \u2013 push to downplay anxiety over Biden as typical liberal \u201cbedwetting,\u201d as the campaign itself described it in a fundraising email after the debate. Organizers on the ground chafed at that language, which the campaign has mostly backed off from, and pointed to it as evidence that Biden and his top aides are disconnected from the situation on the ground. \u201cI think (the calls for Biden to quit) are a function of people who understand the stakes, as Joe Biden himself put it, which is that democracy is on the line and we can\u2019t go upward to go into this fight with one or two hands tied behind our back, which is what we\u2019ll have to do if Joe Biden\u2019s the nominee,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who works closely with a network of grassroots groups around the country. Kevin Tolbert, a first-time delegate and district chair for the Michigan Democratic Party, described the debate as road bump in Biden\u2019s path to reelection \u2013 an opinion he\u2019s shared with doubters. \u201cThe message I\u2019ve been saying to people is this is not the time for us to be caught into our feelings. This is not about who we love or an emotional response,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cThis is the time for us to be very cerebral and very intelligent and make sure we educate people over what\u2019s occurring.\u201d Alan Geraci, a California-based delegate for Biden who is still supportive of him, said the president\u2019s debate performance was \u201cabysmal\u201d and he shouldn\u2019t have taken the stage that night if he was sick or exhausted, as the White House has suggested he was. In the aftermath of that performance, Geraci said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the Biden campaign wasn\u2019t more aggressive with his public appearances. \u201cThey had that next-day North Carolina campaign event that went well, but then it kind of languished for a week,\u201d said Geraci, who is also running for the San Marcos City Council. \u201cI thought that was a huge mistake, that Biden needed to be out there and convincing people that he\u2019s ready for the task, and that the debate indeed was a one-off.\u201d Like many delegates, Geraci has been following the president\u2019s public appearances in the days after the debate. Biden\u2019s interview with ABC was \u201cbetter than the debate,\u201d he said, but not a home run. Geraci was more pleased with positive responses Biden received after a Sunday appearance at a Black church in Philadelphia. \u201cI felt very confident that that\u2019s what he needs to do every single day,\u201d he said. Geraci also pointed to the 1944 election, when ailing Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt campaigned aggressively to overcome public questions about his health, as further evidence that \u201cthe most effective defense is a good, strong offense.\u201d Roosevelt died five months after the election, which he won in a landslide. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a DNC member and close ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during his presidential runs, dismissed any suggestion that delegates were poised \u2013 or inclined \u2013 to launch a \u201crogue takeover.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. The only way the convention is truly going be open is if Biden says, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna run and I release my delegates,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cUnless something spectacularly more daunting than what we saw on that debate stage happens, it\u2019s totally in his hands.\u201d Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, a vocal Biden backer in a House Democratic conference that has shown signs of fracturing, said she had not heard much about the potential for an open convention from her constituents. If a fellow delegate asked for her take, Stevens said, she would point to the scoreboard. \u201cIf I was talking to a delegate in Michigan\u2019s 11th District, in the heart of Oakland County, I would say that 87% of our district voted for Joe Biden, like overwhelmingly,\u201d she told CNN. But Stevens also warned Democrats \u2013 in and outside of Washington \u2013 to choose their words carefully, with a thought for the party\u2019s ability to come together in the fall, as the discourse around Biden heats up. \u201cThis is kind of like disagreeing with your spouse or a family member,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou really gotta watch what you say in these moments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/dnc-delegates-biden-loyalty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_hakeem-jeffries-house-democrat-biden-reaction", "text": "Sunday morning, Hakeem\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0went to church back home in Brooklyn. Shortly after, he tweeted a verse from the Book of Joshua: \u201cDo not be discouraged, for the Lord your god will be with you wherever you go.\u201d That\u2019s from right after the passage where Moses dies of old age, and a new, younger leader takes his people into the Promised Land. This was a coincidence, people familiar say. He just likes the verse. Didn\u2019t mean to imply anything by the context. Most House leaders have to wait until becoming speaker for defining moments.\u00a0Jeffries, still an achingly few five seats away from the majority, will spend this week navigating his biggest test so far even before he gets the gavel \u2014 and in a way that could define if he ever will. The young Black leader of diverse Democrats across the country is in a key spot, many of his colleagues believe: if he stands in support, he could prove the barricade that holds back the restless revolt; if he tells Biden that support has collapsed, that will be more resounding than any poll or campaign fundraising email mocking pundits. Colleagues both who want the president to stay and who want the president to go \u2014 including those infuriated that Biden has called their quiet deference so far proof that he has their support \u2014 are counting on\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0to step up and get them all on the same page. That is not the approach\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0has taken so far, according to CNN\u2019s conversations over the weekend with two dozen Democratic members of Congress and top aides, many of whom were granted anonymity to discuss their private conversations with their leader and with each other. As they land back in Washington on Monday evening, all the emotions that they have been feeling so hard are about to explode into public even more than they did on\u00a0Jeffries\u2019 Sunday evening call with ranking members on top committees. More senior Democrats said they thought Biden needed to go, with New York Rep. Jerry Nadler setting off more discussions by saying the president\u2019s decline was obvious to him. More said they had heard similar sentiment from junior members of their committees. Several warned that Tuesday morning\u2019s caucus meeting, which several members told CNN they think Biden should address himself (but is not currently scheduled to) could be the breaking point, with Biden\u2019s letter to House Democrats on Monday morning saying he is \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to the race and writing of the complaints, \u201cit\u2019s time for it to end,\u201d immediately mocked and dismissed by several senior Democratic members and aides on the Hill. That leaves\u00a0Jeffries. \u201cI think he\u2019s honor-bound to say to the president, \u2018You have very little support in the caucus to stay on the ticket,\u2019\u201d said one senior House Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to take charge,\u201d said another House Democrat in a tough district who wants to see Biden off the ticket. On the record, several of Jeffries\u2019 members outlined the role he would play in the crucial days ahead. \u201cIf he\u2019s leaning in one direction, that may cause a lot of people to lean in that direction,\u201d said California Rep. Brad Sherman, while adding, \u201cNo one believes Hakeem is in control of this \u2014 but he\u2019s influential.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s really good about laying out the facts and coming in and making people go in the direction that he wants them to go,\u201d said Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, a Biden loyalist who is frustrated that so much attention has been put on what is so far just a few defections from the president. \u201cI have confidence in him that he will talk to those individuals, and he will figure out how to stop the bleed and move us forward.\u201d Notably, no member of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 of which Beatty is a former chair \u2013 has broken, in a group\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0himself is part of, as are several older members he is often deferential to.\u00a0The group\u2019s chair, Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford, issued his own statement of support Monday morning. Debate aftermath On delegation-wide text chains and smaller threads, on phone calls stealing away from family vacations, House Democrats have been ricocheting off each other, repeating rumors, counseling each other through depressions and panics, spinning out daydreams of events where Biden steps aside or of ways that the party turns around and rallies to his side. At home in their districts over the holiday week, the Biden campaign spin that only insiders cared about his debate performance crashed into constituents unloading on them at July 4th\u00a0parades or just at the grocery store. Jeffries, meanwhile, was on the phone, on encrypted Signal chats. He said little, according to several colleagues who spoke to him. He listened. He absorbed. He gave members or collections of members chances to propose solutions and ways forward. He told many that he was not going to stand in their way from either sticking with Biden or breaking. He consulted with his whip, Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, and with close Biden ally Delaware Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. Colleagues regularly use words like deliberative and methodical to describe the 53-year-old who took over for Nancy Pelosi in late 2022. In the last 10 days, they describe a man even more inscrutable and Buddha-like than normal. \u201cHakeem is very thoughtful and deliberate, and we\u2019ll work through this week together in a responsible way,\u201d said Ohio Rep. Greg Landsman. \u201cWe\u2019re the adults in the room who get things done. That\u2019s how we approach our jobs every week, and this week won\u2019t be any different. Too much is at stake.\u201d Two very different men who don\u2019t know each other well Jeffries\u00a0does not have a deep or extensive relationship with Biden. A story he tells is getting a call from a blocked number during the transition three-and-a-half years ago, letting it go to voicemail, and being mortified when he realized he had inadvertently passed on a call from the president-elect. They have not spent too much time together since, with\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0ascending as leader just as Democrats returned to the minority in the House and became less relevant to governing. They both see themselves as pragmatists more progressive than they get credit for from the base, but they are very different men.\u00a0Jeffries\u2019\u00a0signature event when he first got to Washington was a \u201cHip Hop on the Hill\u201d fundraiser. Biden prefers Barbra Streisand and Elton John. They\u2019re both from working-class beginnings, but in very different generations: Jeffries\u00a0was born in Brooklyn just a few months before Biden won his first race, for a seat on the New Castle, Delaware,\u00a0county council. The night of the debate,\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0was with several of his members. One\u00a0member\u00a0who saw him said his frustration and disappointment were evident. He\u2019s a politician who prepares methodically, who, in answering reporters\u2019 questions, often slows down his cadence both as he considers the impact of each word in real time and makes sure that he doesn\u2019t get misquoted. Biden\u2019s going onto stage so apparently not ready for what it was and what it would lead to seemed irresponsible. The next morning,\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0arrived at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Blue Dogs, the group of moderate House Democrats. He mentioned a snap poll that showed people didn\u2019t like Donald Trump\u2019s performance either, but made no attempt to defend Biden. He didn\u2019t ask anyone to hold back \u2014 and they did not, though he didn\u2019t say much there either, including when one member said that Biden was going to be a liability that the Democrats in the tightest races in the fall wouldn\u2019t be able to manage. But\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0did point out that Democrats picked up seats in 2016 even as Trump won then. The next day in New York, at a fundraiser for House Democrats, his first question in a fireside chat on stage with former President Barack Obama was about what he called \u201can existential moment many of us believe, in the House, the Senate, certainly at the presidential level.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how we move forward. What should we make of it?\u201d\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0said. He quoted a line from the Cornerstone Baptist Church of his youth that he\u2019d used earlier in the day, \u201cA setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback.\u201d The crowd applauded. \u201cHow,\u201d\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0asked Obama, \u201cshould we think about the opportunity for the comeback?\u201d Jeffries\u00a0hasn\u2019t said anything in public since \u2014 including after Biden called him last Wednesday. He didn\u2019t discuss it with many of his colleagues, other to say that it happened. He didn\u2019t say whether what Biden said had or hadn\u2019t changed his mind. And noticeably, he didn\u2019t put out a public statement of support or pledge it privately, despite Biden\u2019s assertion in his ABC interview on Friday of his conversations with Democratic leaders that \u201cthey all said I should stay in the race.\u201d What\u2019s ahead is a \u201cmessy family conversation,\u201d said California Rep. Jared Huffman, and \u201cwe want to keep together. He sets the tone.\u201d \u2018You can only outrun gravity so much\u2019 In the weeks leading up to the debate, the House Democrats\u2019 official campaign arm got back a round of polling in tight races that showed that their members were already running ahead of generic Republicans, and ahead of Biden, too. Since concerns about the president\u2019s age have been top of voters\u2019 minds for years, several operatives felt in the immediate aftermath of the debate, that was already baked into those numbers. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has not\u00a0conducted\u00a0a battleground district-by-district\u00a0poll since the debate. But House Democratic strategists who talked to the candidates on the cusp and their staff reiterated that their advice was to stay focused on their own races, avoid being pundits and stay away from getting sucked into national politics. That has not been enough for many of the people whose names and jobs will be on the ballot. On principle, those members worry about their independent, truth-teller brands being undercut by sticking with Biden. On politics, they can\u2019t see how to get reelected if Trump is running up big margins in their districts. \u201cThere\u2019s a gravitational force in all these races, and you can only outrun gravity so much,\u201d said\u00a0the frontline House Democrat who wants to see Biden off the ticket. Saving his members\u2019 jobs \u2014 and saving his own hopes of getting the speaker\u2019s job \u2014 many Democratic members feel, may be what turns\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0away from Biden, if he starts to feel that the president remaining as the nominee would lead to a red wave that takes a majority within reach and turns it into a deeper minority. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018You created this mess. They have to clean up their own mess,\u2019\u201d said one House Democrat who has known\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0for years, summarizing his view of the Biden campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not his job to clean it up until it starts to affect his members.\u201d Whether the decision is to stick with Biden or step out on him, \u201cHakeem should have only one statement: \u2018I\u2019m your insurance policy against Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d said California Rep. Ro Khanna. However\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0moves, many members agree that he will move with the faith and admiration among House Democrats that at this point Biden lacks. They know no matter what happens in the next few weeks,\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0is their future, and Biden is not. They know he keeps track of who crosses him and who backs him up. And they agree his reservoir of goodwill and trust among colleagues built up from guiding them through the peak Republican dysfunction in this Congress and February\u2019s special election win means that whatever he says and whenever he says it, most will listen \u2014 even if they don\u2019t like it. \u201cIf Hakeem says, \u2018Listen, I think the president is staying in, and we need to stay unified and fracturing the caucus will only make it more likely that we\u2019ll lose the House,\u201d that might be enough, said another House Democrat who told CNN it\u2019s time for Biden to quit the race but has not said so publicly. \u201cAt a certain point, though, you run out of split ticket voters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eva McKend contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/hakeem-jeffries-house-democrat-biden-reaction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_maura-healey-joe-biden", "text": "Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement Friday urging President Joe Biden to \u201ccarefully evaluate\u201d whether he remains the Democratic Party\u2019s best hope to defeat Donald Trump in the 2024 election. \u201cPresident Biden saved our democracy in 2020 and has done an outstanding job over the last four years. I am deeply grateful for his leadership,\u201d Healy said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAnd I know he agrees this is the most important election of our lifetimes. The best way forward right now is a decision for the president to make. Over the coming days, I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Healey was one of the Democratic governors who met with Biden on Wednesday seeking reassurance over the future of the president\u2019s reelection campaign. With her statement, Healey became the first sitting Democratic governor publicly call on Biden to think about stepping aside \u2013 a significant departure from the public statements of support other governors in the meeting issued. It comes as cracks have begun to appear in Biden\u2019s coalition. Four Democrats in Congress \u2013 Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois \u2013 have asked Biden to bow out. Those calls were signs of the unsteadiness of Democratic support for their top candidate. Some of the president\u2019s comments during Wednesday\u2019s meeting left participants frustrated. Biden told the governors that he needed more sleep and planned to stop scheduling late-night events. He also made a joke that didn\u2019t go over well with some of the them: \u201cI\u2019m fine \u2013 I don\u2019t know about my brain, though.\u201d Biden campaign officials and top surrogates have spent the week since his disastrous debate performance trying to soothe the anxieties of major donors, voters and other down-ballot Democrats. But Biden himself was slow to call party leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. His Wednesday meeting with the governors came after some of them expressed frustration with not having heard from the president. But while Doggett and Grijalva were the first fractures in Biden\u2019s coalition, the vast majority of party leaders remain behind him. Several of the governors who attended Wednesday\u2019s meeting released statements firmly in support of the president. \u201cI heard three words from the President \u2013 he\u2019s all in. And so am I. Joe Biden\u2019s had our back. Now it\u2019s time to have his,\u201d\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said in a statement after the meeting. Michigan Gov. Gretchen\u00a0Whitmer said in a tweet that Biden \u201cis our nominee. He is in it to win it and I support him.\u201d CNN reported earlier this week that Biden sees the next few days as key to his political survival. Among the key events are a campaign rally in Wisconsin Friday afternoon and another event in Pennsylvania on Sunday, along with a high-profile interview on Friday with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/maura-healey-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}

How strong of a guarantee to provide to Ukraine about its future membership to NATO has been a key source of debate between the 32 members of the alliance ahead of this week\u2019s summit in Washington, CNN previously reported. The draft could change before the final version, but the presence of the \u201cirreversible\u201d language would be a significant signal to Kyiv and Moscow as the war in Ukraine continues with little sign of an end. One of the sources, a US official, said the White House supports the use of the word in the final communique as long as the document also reaffirms that Ukraine\u2019s work on democratic reforms must continue. The official said the final version is expected to contain that language. While many Europeans have emphasized the need for strong language around Ukraine\u2019s eventual future in the alliance, US and German officials had proposed describing a \u201cbridge\u201d to NATO membership for Ukraine. However, officials have also stressed the importance of \u201ctangible measures,\u201d in the words of a European diplomat, to support Kyiv\u2019s ongoing fight against Russia. Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, said at an event Monday that it\u2019s not just about language, but it\u2019s about actually bringing Ukraine closer to NATO. A US senior administration official said Friday that the alliance will make \u201csignificant new announcements about how we\u2019re increasing NATO\u2019s military, political and financial support for Ukraine\u201d as part of Kyiv\u2019s \u201cbridge to NATO.\u201d US officials on Monday publicly declined to discuss specifics of the joint communique ahead of the summit, which kicks off on Tuesday. \u201cThere is rightly considerable focus on what Allies will say about Ukraine\u2019s membership path in the summit declaration. The language will be clear and forceful. It will recognize Ukraine\u2019s vital ongoing reform efforts and demonstrate Allied support for Ukraine on its path to NATO membership,\u201d Michael Carpenter, the senior advisor for Europe at the National Security Council, said at a briefing Monday. The senior administration official said Friday that what they \u201cdescribed in terms of the bridge to membership and the deliverables that NATO will be unveiling for Ukraine is quite substantial.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about some sort of plan for how they\u2019re going to get from here to there. We\u2019re talking about standing up an entire command at Wiesbaden, and we\u2019ll look at how we do these various pieces that I mentioned earlier \u2013 training, coordination, equipping, coordination, logistics, force development. This is a very serious effort to get Ukraine in a position, as I said earlier, where it will be ready to assume its roles and responsibilities within the alliance on day one,\u201d the official said. \u201cI\u2019ll let the Ukrainians speak for themselves, but I think they understand the value of what NATO will be doing for that,\u201d they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/draft-nato-communique-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_joe-biden-abc-interview", "text": "A defiant President Joe Biden on Friday downplayed his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate in what had become a high-stakes interview on ABC, as questions swirled over the future of his candidacy. During his interview with anchor George Stephanopoulos, Biden shot down any notion of dropping from the ticket while also offering shifting excuses for his poor performance. The conversation was Biden\u2019s first televised interview since his debate performance, a key moment for his political future as a mounting list of Democrats \u2013 lawmakers, donors and voters \u2013 express concerns about the viability of his candidacy. Here are six takeaways from Biden\u2019s interview with ABC News. Biden says debate was a \u2018bad night,\u2019 not a bigger problem The president said in the interview that he was \u201csick\u201d and \u201cfeeling terrible\u201d before the debate. Asked whether it was a bad episode or a sign of a more serious condition, Biden dismissed those concerns. \u201cIt was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I didn\u2019t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing, and I had a bad night,\u201d he said. In the interview, Biden gave more details about how he was feeling at the time of the debate, saying he was fatigued from illness and had even been tested for Covid-19. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry as to whether the president took the test before or after the debate. He said, \u201cI was feeling terrible. As a matter of fact, the docs with me I asked if they did a Covid test, they were trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn\u2019t. I just had a really bad cold.\u201d The comment about his illness marked the latest turn in the White House\u2019s description of the president\u2019s physical condition during the debate. White House officials told reporters during the debate that the president had a cold, and then on Wednesday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed the idea that Biden had been seen by his doctor, repeatedly saying that the president has had no medical exams since his February physical. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold, guys. It\u2019s a cold,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI know that it affects everybody differently. We\u2019ve all had colds, and so no, he was not checked out by the doctor.\u201d A day later, the White House confirmed that the president had, in fact, seen a doctor about his illness, and on Friday Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One that Biden\u00a0had a \u201cverbal check-in\u201d with his doctor after the debate. She cast Biden\u2019s check-in as \u201ca conversation\u201d with his physician, Kevin O\u2019Connor, after reporters noted that the president told a group of Democratic governors that he saw a doctor. The president takes ownership of poor performance, but offers a new excuse The president said he has not watched a replay of his performance. When he was asked whether he knew how badly it was going, he said it was \u201cnobody\u2019s fault but mine.\u201d As he answered the question, Biden offered a confusing tangent on New York Times polling. \u201cI prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back as foreign leaders or National Security Council \u2013 for explicit detail. And I realized, about partway through that \u2013 you know, all that I get quoted is The New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is that \u2013 what I looked at is he also lied 28 times,\u201d he said. Pressed on his performance, he said, \u201cWell I was just having a bad night.\u201d But later in the interview, Biden offered a different explanation. He said he was distracted by Trump talking out of turn even though Trump\u2019s microphone was muted. \u201cIt came to me I was having a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering a question, even when they turned his mic off, he was still shouting. And I let it distract me. I\u2019m not blaming it on that, but I realized that I just wasn\u2019t in control,\u201d Biden told Stephanopoulos. Biden and\u00a0Trump\u00a0and their teams agreed to the rules ahead of the debate. Biden won\u2019t take a cognitive test and release it to voters Biden said that \u201cno one said I had to\u201d have\u00a0cognitive and neurological exams, telling Stephanopoulos that \u201cI get a full neurological test every day\u201d \u2013 referring to the demands of his job. \u201cI have medical doctors traveling everywhere. Every president does, as you know. Medical doctors from the best of the world travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing assessment of what I\u2019m doing. They don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if they think there\u2019s something else is wrong,\u201d he said. When asked whether he\u2019s had\u00a0cognitive\u00a0tests and an exam by a neurologist, Biden said no. \u201cNo one said I had to. \u2026 They said I\u2019m good.\u201d In\u00a0an analysis\u00a0published Friday, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta \u2013 a practicing neurosurgeon \u2013 urged Biden to undergo thorough\u00a0cognitive\u00a0and neurological testing and to share his results. Gupta wrote that it was concerning to watch Biden\u2019s performance at the debate. Detailed testing \u201ccan help determine whether there is a simpler explanation for the symptoms displayed or if there is something more concerning,\u201d he said. Biden denies polls show him losing to Trump Asked by Stephanopoulos whether he was being honest with himself about his ability to beat Trump, Biden said, \u201cYes. Yes, yes, yes.\u201d He pointed to previous\u00a0polls\u00a0that showed he couldn\u2019t win in 2020 as proof and subsequent down-ballot elections, denying extensive polling that reflects a race where he is trailing. Pressed on his low approval rating and whether it would be tougher to win four years later, Biden said, \u201cNot when you\u2019re running against a pathological liar. Not when he hasn\u2019t been challenged in the way he\u2019s about to be challenged.\u201d The president said that all of his\u00a0pollsters characterize the race as a \u201ctoss up\u201d as he began to point to specific\u00a0polls\u00a0before trailing off. Biden brushes off nervous Dems: Only the \u2018Lord Almighty\u2019 could get him to leave the race Asked during his interview whether he would step down if he became convinced he could not beat Trump, Biden said he would only do so \u201cif the Lord Almighty comes down\u201d and tells him to. \u201cIf the Lord Almighty came down and said, \u2018Joe, get out of the race,\u2019 I\u2019d get out of the race,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe Lord Almighty\u2019s not coming down,\u201d added Biden, who is a devout Catholic. Stephanopoulos responded: \u201cI agree that the Lord Almighty is not going to come down. But if you are told reliably from your allies, and your friends and supporters in the Democratic Party, in the House, in the Senate that they\u2019re concerned you\u2019re going to lose the House and the Senate if you stay in, what will you do?\u201d Biden declined to answer the question. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he added. The president later questioned whether any other Democratic leader would have his foreign policy acumen. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be able to hold\u00a0NATO\u00a0together like me? Who\u2019s going to be able to be in a position where I\u2019m able to keep the Pacific basin in a position where we\u2019re at least check being in China now? Who\u2019s going to \u2013 who\u2019s going to do that? Who has that reach?\u201d Biden asked. Four Democratic members of Congress have called on Biden to step aside. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement Friday asking Biden to \u201ccarefully evaluate\u201d whether he is the party\u2019s best choice to defeat Donald Trump. And Virginia Sen. Mark Warner is looking to get Senate Democrats on the same page about the future of\u00a0Biden\u2019s reelection bid, sources told CNN, putting further pressure on the White House. Warner, who is taking on a leadership role in the effort, is reaching a place where he thinks it is time for Biden to suspend his reelection campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. Asked about Warner\u2019s efforts, Biden responded: \u201cMark is a good man. \u2026 He also tried to get the nomination.\u201d Warner had been considered a vice presidential contender in 2008, the slot that Biden would eventually win, but withdrew himself from consideration. \u201cMark\u2019s not \u2013 Mark and I have a different perspective,\u201d Biden told Stephanopoulos. Asked whether he would reconsider his stance if more high-ranking Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries pushed him to drop out, Biden responded: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d Biden gets fired up and shows off his energy at Wisconsin rally Biden came face-to-face with voter concerns just before the ABC interview, as he was taking the stage at a campaign rally in Wisconsin. A rally attendee unfurled a sign reading, \u201cPass the torch, Joe.\u201d The sign was visible for a few moments before someone else tried to cover part of it with a Biden-Harris sign. Biden\u2019s speech during that rally was animated and energetic \u2013 though he seemed to realize that each of his words would be parsed and carefully scrutinized in this politically crucial period. He vowed to \u201cbeat Trump again in 2020\u201d before quickly realizing his mistake and correcting himself: \u201cBy the way, we\u2019re gonna do it again in 2024.\u201d Slamming Trump\u2019s economic policy, Biden said his opponent \u201cwants another 5 billion - trillion, trillion, not billion - $5 trillion tax cut.\u201d He directly addressed criticisms about his age: \u201cI wasn\u2019t too old to create over 50 million new jobs, to make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act, to beat Big Pharma. \u2026 Was I too old to relieve student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too old to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America? To sign the Respect for Marriage Act?\u201d Biden said unnamed forces are \u201ctrying to push him out of the race.\u201d \u201cWell, let me say this as quick as I can,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m staying in the race.\u201d That point was punctuated by the song that played as Biden\u2019s speech concluded: Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/joe-biden-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_wisconsin-voters-biden-debate", "text": "Lisa Reissmann had to stop watching. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem as strong as what he has been in the past,\u201d she said of President Joe Biden\u2019s performance last month at the CNN debate. \u201cI was really having a hard time watching it. Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change", "text": "The day after their CNN presidential debate, former President Donald Trump cited a wildly inaccurate figure about sea levels to mock President Joe Biden\u2019s debate\u00a0claim that\u00a0\u201cthe only existential threat to humanity is climate change.\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at a Friday rally in Virginia that \u201cglobal warming is fine,\u201d rejecting the view of the overwhelming majority of scientists. And he said of Biden: \u201cHe said it again last night, that global warming is an existential threat. And I say that the thing that\u2019s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise \u2013 maybe, it may go down, also \u2013 but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.\u201d He added what appeared to be a joke: \u201cWhich gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you\u2019re lucky\u00a0enough though.\u201d Facts\u00a0First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim about the expected pace of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0not even close to correct. The global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0is\u00a0currently risi\ufeffng\u00a0more\u00a0per year\u00a0than Trump claimed that people\u00a0say it will rise \u201cin the next 497 years.\u201d NASA\u00a0reported\u00a0in March that the current global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches\u00a0per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization\u00a0report this\u00a0year\u00a0said the rate of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise between 2014 and 2023 was\u00a0about 0.19 inches\u00a0per year. In other words,\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0already more than an eighth of an inch annually \u2013 and it is\u00a0accelerating. NASA\u00a0found\u00a0a jump of 0.3 inches\u00a0between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary\u00a0sciences\u00a0who\u00a0studies\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise,\u00a0said\u00a0last year that Trump\u2019s\u00a0similar claims\u00a0\u201ccan only be described as\u00a0totally out of touch with reality\u201d and that Trump \u201chas\u00a0no idea what he is\u00a0talking about.\u201d Sea levels\u00a0rise by different amounts\u00a0in\u00a0different locations. For the US,\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are\u00a0expected to rise particularly fast\u00a0for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast \u2013 and Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of Florida, which is\u00a0bordered by both of those coasts, is\u00a0expected to be\u00a0affected more\u00a0severely\u00a0than many other coastal\u00a0states. In fact, Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims\u00a0about\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is\u00a0on the Atlantic. Griggs\u00a0noted in a June email that\u00a0data\u00a0from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago\u00a0shows\u00a0an increase of an eighth of an inch\u00a0roughly\u00a0every\u00a0nine months. Trump has\u00a0made similar claims\u00a0since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also\u00a0previously\u00a0made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property.\u00a0In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland \u2013\u00a0rendering some communities uninhabitable\u00a0and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of\u00a0flooding, making hurricanes\u00a0more destructive, and damaging\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and ecosystems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_white-house-biden-despondent", "text": "As President Joe Biden\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, many inside the White House \u2013 still rattled by the president\u2019s disastrous debate performance last month \u2013 are now gripped with anxiety and unease about whether Biden will continue his reelection campaign. The mood since Biden\u2019s dismal showing at CNN\u2019s presidential debate on June 27 has been somber, multiple sources inside and outside the White House tell CNN, as staffers ranging from younger junior aides to more seasoned officials have struggled to make sense of Biden\u2019s halting 90-plus minutes on the debate stage. Inside the White House, where TV screens are always on and set to four cable news channels \u2013 CNN, MSNBC, Fox and CNBC \u2013 the devastating headlines casting doubt on Biden\u2019s political future have been unavoidable. The latest blow came Sunday, when more than a handful of House Democratic ranking members told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a call that Biden needs to step aside, according to sources familiar. In the tumultuous days since the debate, many senior administration officials have had check-ins with their teams and individual direct reports, sources said. These conversations have been intended to offer staff emotional support and encourage aides to keep their heads down and continue the Biden administration\u2019s work. Group texts among administration officials have been buzzing \u2013 rapid-fire exchanges trading the latest gossip and headlines about the president\u2019s future. Over the weekend, there was one widely discussed topic of intrigue: the identity of one \u201csenior White House official\u201d who anonymously told The New York Times that they do not believe the president should continue to seek reelection. That person was described as having worked with Biden during his presidency, vice presidency and 2020 campaign. When asked about that person, one senior White House official gave CNN a brusque response: \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be in the White House. Period.\u201d  This official also insisted they had not heard anything in the building resembling the suggestion that the president should abandon the race. Multiple sources said that for now, support for the president\u2019s candidacy appears to remain largely intact among the senior ranks at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \u2013 even if it all feels tenuous. \u201cThey\u2019re just kind of: \u2018He\u2019s in.\u2019 They\u2019re not veering off that, because once that cracks, that cracks hard,\u201d one senior Democrat in close contact with both White House and campaign officials said. Biden himself has publicly remained resolute about staying in the race. In a\u00a0letter to congressional Democrats\u00a0on Monday, the president said he is \u201cfirmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\u201d He pointed to the democratic process that has already played out in the election in the forcefully worded letter. \u201cThe voters \u2013 and the voters alone \u2013 decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can we stand for\u00a0democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.\u201d Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, held an all-staff call last week rallying the team to tune out the chatter and press ahead with their work. Keep your \u201cheads down, get things done, execution, execution, execution. Second, heads up \u2013 there\u2019s so much to be proud of, and there\u2019s so much more we will do together under this president\u2019s leadership,\u201d Zients said, according to a source. Despite those efforts, nerves are running high inside the White House heading into what many Democrats believe could be a consequential week for Biden, as he is expected to learn whether he will confront a full revolt from lawmakers in his own party. One source said the single best word to capture the mood heading into this week is simply \u201cuneasiness.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/white-house-biden-despondent/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_politics_republican-convention-target-extremists", "text": "The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week could be an \u201cattractive\u201d target for violent extremists or other people looking to sow chaos by disrupting a high-profile political event, according to a threat assessment from federal agencies and the Milwaukee Police Department obtained by CNN. This election season has seen a \u201cresurgence in disruptive tactics targeting election symbols\u201d that are very likely meant to \u201cinstill fear and disrupt operations at election-related critical infrastructure facilities,\u201d according to the assessment.\u00a0The report was\u00a0prepared by the\u00a0FBI, US Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, and Wisconsin state and city law enforcement officials. Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis distributed the assessment to federal, state and local officials in recent days. There is \u201cno credible reporting to indicate a threat\u201d to the Republican National Convention, but \u201cviolent threat actors\u201d may view the convention \u201cas an attractive target due to its symbolic nature and link to the 2024 general election,\u201d says the threat assessment, which was dated July 2. One of the \u201cdisruptive tactics\u201d that law enforcement officials are worried about is \u201cswatting,\u201d in which a caller makes a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. Since December, at least four swatting incidents have been aimed at the homes of elections officials, CNN previously\u00a0reported. The Republican National Convention, taking place July 15-18, is expected to draw some 50,000 people as Republicans nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate. It comes at a time of bitter partisan divide and simmering tensions among Americans over policies such as President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. \u201cDHS and FBI remain concerned about the possibility of violent conflict occurring at otherwise lawful protest events or gatherings linked to the 2024 RNC,\u201d the threat assessment says. There are also expected to be security concerns and a large law enforcement presence around the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The Republican convention, like other major political events, is an opportunity for foreign intelligence services to collect information on policy positions or people with \u201cperceived access\u201d to political campaigns, the threat assessment says. Blockbuster political events like the convention also \u201cremain attractive targets\u201d for foreign terrorists or domestic violent extremists looking to draw attention to their ideological causes, according to the assessment. There are\u00a0heightened concerns\u00a0from US officials that an ISIS affiliate could carry out an attack on US soil, CNN reported last month. A DHS spokesperson told CNN in a statement that \u201cThe U.S. is in a heightened threat environment,\u201d as the agency detailed in a September threat assessment. \u201cWe continue to work with our partners to evaluate the threat environment, provide updates to the American public, and protect our homeland,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere is no credible reporting to indicate a threat to the Republican National Convention at this time, but the event may be viewed as a target. We urge the public to stay vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activity to their local law enforcement.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has designated the Republican National Convention a National Special Security Event, or NSSE \u2014 a common designation for major events that might be a target of criminals or terrorists, a US official told CNN. Threat assessments like the one issued for the Republican National Convention are issued for all NSSE events. \u201cWhile our standard practice is to not comment on specific intelligence products, the FBI regularly shares information with our law enforcement partners to assist in protecting the communities they serve,\u201d the FBI said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe FBI encourages members of the public to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.\u201d The Secret Service referred questions about the threat assessment to Homeland Security. CNN has also requested comment from the Milwaukee Police Department. Federal, state and local law enforcement officials have spent months preparing for the Republican convention, mapping out potential threats and chasing down investigative leads. In February, according to the threat assessment, \u201can unidentified individual\u201d was seen \u201crecording/photographing\u201d during a delivery to a loading dock at the exterior of Fiserv Forum \u2014\u00a0the arena that is the main venue for the convention. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating the incident, the assessment says. The Secret Service last month laid out the security measures for the convention, including a perimeter that will prevent protesters from gathering at a large park near the venue. The announcement\u00a0came\u00a0after a\u00a0monthslong dispute between the Secret Service and the Republican Party over security measures around the convention. The party had accused the agency of ignoring its concerns, while the Secret Service said Republicans were undermining efforts to keep the event safe. Around the convention, law enforcement officials are also on alert for the mailing of suspicious packages, arson, property destruction and the exposure of public officials\u2019 private information online, according to the threat assessment. Election offices in multiple states reported receiving suspicious packages around the November 2023 gubernatorial and state legislative elections. \u201cWe also remain concerned about the potential for hoax threats to disrupt the 2024 RNC, leading to evacuations and closures of political events, as well as straining law enforcement resources,\u201d the document says. The large influx of out-of-state visitors could also be a boon for sex traffickers, officials warned. \u201cThe FBI anticipates victims will arrive in Wisconsin and advertise online or in locations known to offer sexual services in the weeks prior to the events,\u201d according to the assessment.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_trump-filing-aileen-cannon-immunity", "text": "Attorneys for former President Donald Trump are now seeking to use the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity decision to help him in his criminal case in Florida over the mishandling of classified documents. In a new court filing\u00a0Friday, Trump\u2019s team\u00a0said they want an updated schedule in the federal classified documents case so they can argue points related to the Supreme Court decision. The decision \u201cguts the Office\u2019s position that President Trump has \u2018no immunity\u2019 and further demonstrates the politically-motivated nature of their contention that the motion is \u2018frivolous,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision directly applies to the federal case over 2020 election subversion efforts in Washington, DC, but it could impact all four of the criminal cases against the former president. In the filing Friday, Trump\u2019s attorneys also noted Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0concurrence to the decision, questioning the validity of\u00a0special\u00a0counsel Jack Smith\u2019s appointment.\u00a0Trump\u2019s attorneys argue\u00a0the concurrence\u00a0\u201cadds force\u201d to motions Trump has filed against how Smith was appointed and funded. CNN previously reported that Trump\u2019s legal team planned to use this week\u2019s Supreme Court opinion to try to get key evidence in the classified documents case tossed out, and Friday\u2019s filing is the first step toward that end. The move is likely to further elongate an already convoluted and slow road to trial in Judge Aileen Cannon\u2019s courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida. The judge has yet to decide a number of pretrial matters, including some motions that have been languishing on her docket for months. Among them is a request from Trump to dismiss most of the charges because Trump\u2019s team says he has presidential immunity for his decision to remove the classified records he held on to in Florida from the White House in the final hours of his presidency. Cannon has not had a hearing on the matter, but she is likely to take into consideration the Supreme Court\u2019s new ruling, which says the president\u2019s core constitutional powers are immune from prosecution and that courts may need to look more closely at other actions a president takes to see if those may be immune as well. In the historic opinion released Monday, Thomas wrote about the legality of the special counsel\u2019s office, saying he believed Smith may not be a legitimately appointed prosecutor under the Constitution. That topic hadn\u2019t even been raised by Trump\u2019s team in the DC case,\u00a0but Trump\u2019s legal team and Smith\u2019s prosecutors argued about the issue at length during a hearing before Cannon last week, with Trump\u2019s team in line with Thomas\u2019 position. Cannon, a Trump appointee, showed some interest in Trump\u2019s arguments at the hearing but hasn\u2019t yet issued a ruling on that either.

{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_joe-biden-campaign-crisis", "text": "President\u00a0Joe Biden needs to do far more to quell Democratic panic over his terrible performance at his debate showdown with\u00a0former President\u00a0Donald Trump, and fast. After Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett on Tuesday became the first\u00a0Democratic\u00a0lawmaker to break ranks\u00a0and\u00a0demand Biden step aside, top party figures\u00a0are now asking for more\u00a0openness and details on the president\u2019s health and mental state as the anxiety about his reelection campaign evolves into an increasingly genuine threat to his grip on the Democratic nomination. Every effort the president and his White House and campaign teams make to fix the problem end up exacerbating it. Biden, for instance, on Tuesday evening\u00a0joked to\u00a0donors that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d with Trump after two grueling trips to Europe last month. It was an odd way to parry claims that he is no longer fit for the demanding duties of his office as he asks for a second term at age 81. The fallout from the debate has created another extraordinary twist in a stunning campaign featuring two presidents, one who is a convicted felon, and the other who is already the oldest to hold the job in history. The debate crystalized many fears of Democrats about Biden\u2019s prospects and played into months of claims by Trump, 78, that his rival is weak and mentally diminished. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0endured a briefing that was almost as painful to watch as the debate itself. She said that while Biden had a cold at the debate, he hadn\u2019t taken medication but was now feeling better. But she declined to go beyond Biden\u2019s already released annual physical results that found him fit for duty in February. The explanations did not account for why Biden trailed off in some answers, sometimes appeared incoherent and stared\u00a0open-mouthed\u00a0while Trump spoke during the CNN debate. Biden\u2019s team also keeps answering the wrong question. \u201cThe best predictor of future behavior is past performance,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, stressing that the true test of Biden capabilities was his record in office for the past 3\u00bd years. But the issue that was really posed by the debate was whether voters can imagine him \u2013 in his diminished current state \u2013 able to fully serve another term that would end when he is 86. Jean-Pierre insisted that \u201cwe understand how the American people are feeling. We get it, we do.\u201d But her briefing created only more intrigue about what really went on inside the president\u2019s tight inner circle. While the first cracks are appearing in the Democratic firewall around the president, the public calls for him to step aside\u00a0so the party can choose another nominee\u00a0are not yet anywhere near critical mass. But the calls by senior Democrats for more explanation from the president and for energy in his campaigning are now impossible for\u00a0Biden and his team\u00a0to ignore. And the ultimate outcome of the panic over Biden\u2019s performance is now not possible to predict \u2013 a hugely vulnerable position for a president seeking a second term. Democratic Sen. Peter Welch from Vermont said Tuesday:\u00a0\u201cThe big question going into that debate was the age question. \u2026 The outcome of the debate was that that question on age was intensified.\u201d \u201cWe have got to deal with that. That\u2019s the real issue, and have frank conversations about it, because at the end of the day, the existential question facing the Democratic Party is how do we keep Trump from being president \u2013 and whatever it takes, every decision each of us makes from President Biden down to a precinct captain in the South Side of Chicago should be through the lens of how best do we protect Democracy and protect America,\u201d Welch told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on \u201cNewsNight.\u201d Perhaps most importantly, the comparison between the wise, sober, statesmanlike Biden and the wild, lawless Trump\u00a0that\u00a0the president\u2019s campaign had anticipated for months has been obliterated by speculation over Biden\u2019s health and endurance. Biden needed to use the debate to turn around a race he was in danger of losing, and he may now have squandered his best chance to overtake the ex-president. Biden to sit for ABC interview In a new effort to calm public concern, Biden will grant an interview to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Friday in what is now shaping up as an even more critical test of his acuity than the debate. And he\u2019ll meet Democratic governors in Washington on Wednesday, both in person and virtually,\u00a0following demands for direct\u00a0contact\u00a0that underscored\u00a0the fact that\u00a0many Democrats believe Biden\u2019s inner circle has been remote and unresponsive to their concerns over a period of months. One of those governors, Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, said in a remarkably candid interview with CNN on Tuesday that Biden\u2019s debate was \u201crough\u201d and that whatever the polls say, it will damage his campaign. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee, and ultimately that decision on continuing or not will fall to him and his family,\u201d Beshear, who\u2019s been mentioned as a potential replacement nominee if Biden backs out, told Pamela Brown. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking the president to talk to the American people a little bit more about his health or that debate performance.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like seeing somebody that you haven\u2019t seen in a while and they seem a little  off, and you asking how they\u2019re doing and then listening to their answer. It\u2019s both showing concern for them but also just trying to make sure that things are OK.\u201d Like Beshear, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi couched her comments by saying\u00a0Biden is\u00a0a great president and that Trump would\u00a0pose\u00a0a serious threat to the rule of\u00a0law. But\u00a0she also speculated on the president\u2019s health. \u201cI think it\u2019s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a\u00a0condition?\u201d she asked on MSNBC on Tuesday, adding that it was also a fair question to ask about the presumptive Republican nominee. A bad day started just after dawn Biden\u2019s political position deteriorated on Tuesday as dawn broke, when Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt that the president needed to understand that his decision on whether to stay in the race would reverberate for years to come and that the House and Senate were at stake. A few hours later, Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to call for Biden to relinquish the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cThere\u2019s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus,\u201d another House Democratic lawmaker told\u00a0CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar\u00a0on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside], but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d A new CNN/SSRS poll, meanwhile, showed that three-quarters of Americans believe Democrats would have a better chance of beating\u00a0Trump\u00a0with a candidate other than Biden. And even unpopular Vice President Kamala Harris fared better in the matchup with Trump than her boss. Another danger sign for the president is that despite his insistence that he will stay in the race, some Democrats are beginning to answer questions about what would happen if he was no longer the nominee \u2013 despite the extraordinary logistical challenges that would entail at the Democratic National Convention in August. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn \u2013 one of Biden\u2019s most vehement supporters \u2013 said on MSNBC on Tuesday that he still wanted to see the president on the top of the ticket. But he also offered support for the vice president. \u201cI will support her if he were to step aside,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cThis party should not in any way do anything to work around Miss Harris.\u201d He added: \u201cWe should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it\u2019s in second place or at the top of the ticket.\u201d Sen. Laphonza Butler also said she still backs Biden. But she offered a strong endorsement of her fellow Californian. \u201cI think she\u2019s done an incredible job being a partner to the president and leading the party and leading the country, and I think that she will continue to be that,\u201d Butler said. In his interview, Beshear \u2013 who, as a red-state governor, would draw vice presidential speculation on a different ticket \u2013 also had praise for Harris, saying he\u2019d been happy to work with a vice president whose initially shaky adaptation to the role means she would be far from a certainty to step up if Biden chose to leave the race. The CNN/SSRS poll shows Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup \u2013 trailing by 47% to 45%,\u00a0inside the margin of error.\u00a0Biden\u00a0was down\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0to the former president. But the vice president made sure there is no daylight between her and Biden during a brief interview with CBS News. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d\u00a0she said, adding, \u201cI am proud to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/joe-biden-campaign-crisis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_biden-abc-interview-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s struggle to prove he\u2019s got the strength and cognitive capacity for a second term is becoming an excruciating personal and national ordeal. Watching a visibly aged Biden answer frank questions Friday about his health on primetime television \u2013 which would normally remain between a patient and their doctor \u2013 felt like an affront to presidential dignity. It was sad to see a person who\u2019s respected and beloved by many Americans suffer such a plight. And it would be a hard heart that did not empathize with Biden as he confronts the painful human realities of aging in the most public manner imaginable. Yet Biden\u2019s position, his shocking presidential debate performance and his defiant refusal to contemplate its implications for his reelection campaign, mean he\u2019s forcing the country to have the conversation. The political tide may be turning against Biden, but the interview underscored his deep pride in a presidency that it took him nearly half a century to achieve. And he\u2019s not close to giving up his lifelong mantra to stand up and fight when he\u2019s knocked down \u2013 a factor that will exacerbate the Democratic Party\u2019s dilemma. While his interview performance was far stronger than the president\u2019s often incoherent showing at the CNN debate in Atlanta, that\u2019s not saying much. It did not contain any new disasters that would push him immediately out of the race. But it equally did little to quell the storm assailing his campaign and raised fresh intrigue about his health amid increasing signs his Democratic power base is beginning to crack. It\u2019s becoming clear that the president, his party and the country are slipping inexorably into a political crisis that raises the extraordinary possibility that a presumptive nominee could be pushed aside weeks before his party\u2019s national convention and four months before one of the most critical elections in history. The threats to Biden\u2019s prospects are quickly mounting. Two more Democratic congressman Friday called on the president to cede the nomination to a younger candidate. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner moved forward with an effort to get Senate Democrats on the same page about Biden\u2019s future and is reaching a place where he thinks it\u2019s time for Biden to suspend his campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. And House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting with ranking party committee members as he faces increasing pressure from his conference over Biden\u2019s position, a Democratic lawmaker said. A test set by the campaign Biden\u2019s campaign had scheduled the interview with ABC News to try to prove that the president\u2019s stumbling debate performance last week was an aberration and to shut down growing doubts about his position as his party\u2019s 2024 nominee. He appeared more composed and fluent than at the CNN debate. He made a far more robust argument for his own successes in office and more effectively prosecuted a case against Trump than he did in the debate. And he dug in deeper despite calls by a handful of a Democratic lawmakers for him to fold his reelection bid and the growing panic among many others yet to break cover. He also dismissed concerns about his health, insisting that he was not frailer than before. \u201cCan I run the 100 (in) 10 flat? No, but I\u2019m still in good shape,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,\u201d Biden said in the interview conducted in swing state Wisconsin. \u201cIf the Lord Almighty came down and said, \u2018Joe, get out of the race,\u2019 I\u2019d get out of the race,\u201d Biden said, but added: \u201cThe Lord Almighty\u2019s not coming down.\u201d But Biden\u2019s admission that he felt \u201cterrible\u201d in the days before his clash with the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump only posed new questions about his health. Those questions come at a time of growing anxiety that he\u2019s well enough at 81 to shoulder the exhausting demands of the presidency and the strain of a reelection bid. Biden compounded those doubts by seeming unsure about whether he\u2019d watched a playback of the debate \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no,\u201d he said when asked if he\u2019d watched the event \u2013 and other moments in which he trailed off in some sentences. And he added yet another explanation for his poor debate performance to add to his allies\u2019 claims he was overloaded with facts by staff, jet-lagged and suffering from a cold. The president said Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking even though his microphone was muted had put him off. Asked whether he was the same man who took office three years ago, Biden deflected by offering a litany of his achievements. \u201cIn terms of successes, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be coming to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.\u201d The president was adamant that the debate was a only \u201ca bad night\u201d for which he took responsibility. But more than a week after the event, and amid rising fear among Democrats about his prospects in November and the possibility of what it will mean for democracy if Trump wins a second term, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. One bad night on such a high-profile stage before millions of viewers may be all it takes to irretrievably damage the campaign of president who will be 82 two weeks after Election Day, who large majorities of Americans worry is unfit to serve and who is asking the country to keep him in office until January 2029. Americans are worried about the next four years, not the last three Biden and his supporters warn that his painful 90 minutes on stage in Atlanta should not overshadow the achievements of his time in office. And they say that the threat posed by Trump and his autocratic instincts and vow to dedicate a second presidency to \u201cretribution\u201d far outweigh concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity. But the question that millions of Americans are asking has less to do with a review of Biden\u2019s first-term legacy and is more about whether he can function for four more grueling White House years. The interview also begged the question of whether the president is fully aware of the corrosive impact of the debate on confidence among Democrats over his chances of beating Trump. He quarreled with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos over polling that showed him slipping further behind the former president nationally and in swing states. The interview was one of a series of events, including the Friday rally and a planned news conference at the NATO summit next week in Washington, that the campaign has held up as moments to prove Biden\u2019s fitness. But Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California told CNN that the president needed to do a prolonged and live television interview unlike the recorded one on ABC. Other members are demanding the president get out far more to prove his stamina, even though the campaign on Friday promised an \u201caggressive\u201d program of events in July. But that pledge did not stop the growing demands for Biden to step aside. \u201cPresident Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington\u2019s, footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Massachusetts Rep. Seth\u00a0Moulton\u00a0told Boston radio station WBUR in an interview that went out before the ABC interview aired. And\u00a0Illinois Rep. Mike\u00a0Quigley\u00a0said Biden\u2019s continued presence in the race has \u201calmost no hope of succeeding.\u201d \u201cI would say Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing you can do now to cement that for all-time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this,\u201d\u00a0Quigley told MSNBC.\u00a0He later added on CNN: \u201cWhat we need right now \u2013 and what I think takes a spine \u2013 is to step aside and recognize the president of the United States doesn\u2019t have the vigor necessary to overcome the deficit here and it\u2019s going to affect us all.\u201d Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Maura\u00a0Healey did not go quite so far but said in a statement to CNN that Biden needed to \u201ccarefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate is especially painful for Democrats because many of them believe that the president has done a good job in reviving the post-Covid-19 economy, powering job growth, harnessing US allies overseas and passing big-ticket infrastructure and climate change plans. But increasingly, it seems as though the fear of a Trump term may be overwhelming satisfaction with Biden\u2019s achievements. To temper such worries, Biden used the rally to pivot from questions about his age to try to refocus attention on what he\u2019d actually done in office. \u201cI keep seeing all\u00a0those stories about I\u2019m being too\u00a0old,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me say something. I wasn\u2019t too\u00a0old\u00a0to create over 15 million new jobs. To make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act. Was I too\u00a0old\u00a0to release student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too\u00a0old\u00a0to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in the United States of America?\u201d After the debate, Biden\u2019s every word is under intense scrutiny and risks bolstering a critical narrative about his age and mental acuity after he seared an image of a struggling, president diminished by age in the mind of viewers. So, one fatalistic statement in the ABC interview about how he\u2019d feel next January if Trump won is likely to inflame concerns of many Democrats about his mindset, his understanding of his situation and what will happen in November. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said. The Biden campaign later contacted CNN to argue that the president had not said \u201cgoodest\u201d and ABC News changed its transcript of the interview to read \u201cI did the good as job as I know I can do.\u201d An editor\u2019s note said the transcript was \u201cupdated for clarity.\u201d The audio of the sentence is not conclusive on the question. But the situation underscored the extent to which every word the president utters following the debate is under the highest scrutiny.

{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_harris-black-voters-essence-festival", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday put the focus on the dangers of a second Trump administration, rather than the growing concerns over President Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy, as she attempted to convince Black voters to once again deliver a win for the Biden-Harris ticket. \u201cThis is probably the most significant election of our lifetime,\u201d Harris said during a moderated conversation at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, claiming that former President Donald Trump has \u201copenly\u201d expressed \u201chis intention to be a dictator on Day 1\u201d if reelected. Harris\u2019 stop at the annual Black music and cultural festival comes as the Biden campaign works to\u00a0revive a corner of the coalition\u00a0that helped propel the president to the White House in 2020. Biden beat Trump 87% to 12% among Black voters in 2020, according to CNN exit polls. But Trump has made inroads with the critical voting bloc recently. A\u00a0New York Times/Siena College survey\u00a0of battleground states released in May found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden, which would amount to a historic high if it translates to votes in November. Harris attempted to convince festival attendees that \u201cwe can see it through\u201d if they once again vote in record numbers. \u201cPeople voted\u00a0in record numbers in 2020. This is what was able to happen, and when everyone votes in those numbers again in 122 days, we can see it through,\u201d Harris said. The White House in recent days has struggled to quell concerns over the president\u2019s mental fitness and the viability of his campaign following his poor performance in CNN\u2019s presidential debate last week. Some Democrats have called on the president to closely examine his reelection bid, while others have gone as far as calling for him to step aside. Biden has remained defiant, telling reporters in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday that he\u2019s \u201ccompletely ruling out\u201d exiting the race. Many look to Harris as the obvious successor if Biden steps aside, with a recent CNN poll conducted after the debate\u00a0showing the vice president\u00a0outpacing Biden in a hypothetical race against Trump. Some Republicans, meanwhile, are hoping to avoid a Harris presidential candidacy as they believe Trump\u2019s path back to the White House would likely be easier\u00a0against Biden. But Harris has repeatedly come to Biden\u2019s defense, and CNN reported\u00a0earlier\u00a0this week that the vice president and\u00a0her staff have purposely snubbed most of the calls and texts coming their way, reiterating that she intends to stick by his side. The vice president was able to avoid talking about worries within her own party Saturday as the moderator did not specifically ask about concerns over Biden\u2019s reelection bid. Meanwhile, other Biden surrogates at the event tackled the issue head-on, throwing their support behind the president and telling voters that he\u2019s not going anywhere. Rep. Joyce Beatty argued that Biden shouldn\u2019t withdraw from the race just because of one debate. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had a bad day,\u201d the Ohio Democrat said, later adding: \u201cDon\u2019t go out there turning your back on this president.\u201d California Rep. Maxine Waters emphasized, \u201cBiden is not going anywhere.\u201d When asked whether she would support Harris \u2014 a fellow Californian \u2014\u00a0if the president were to drop out, Waters said, \u201cWe\u2019re focused on Biden. We\u2019re focused on the fact that not only has he done a good job, that we anticipate that he\u2019s going to continue.\u201d Many festival attendees who spoke to CNN said they think Harris is prepared to step in should Biden bow out of the race. But ultimately, voters said they will cast their ballot for whoever the Democratic nominee is in November. \u201cKeep the ticket the way it is. Her time will come. \u2026 Stick with the game plan. You had a plan; stick with the plan. The plan worked before; it will work again,\u201d said Jeri Peris, a New Orleans resident. Peris said Biden\u2019s poor debate performance was \u201ca one-off,\u201d adding, \u201cEverybody gets sick. He\u2019s a good president. He\u2019s a good man. He\u2019s done great things. Everyone has an off day.\u201d Laura Morgan Roberts of Washington, DC, said it\u2019s a \u201cno-brainer\u201d that she will vote for Biden in November, but added, \u201cI am 100% confident in Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 ability, commitment, desire to lead the country and do what\u2019s best for our people.\u201d Meanwhile, Michelle Buxton from Chattanooga, Tennessee, told CNN, \u201cIt just seems like they aren\u2019t giving (Biden) a chance.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here all working together and I think it almost seems personal,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that they should bring him down.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner,\u00a0Ali Main\u00a0and\u00a0Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/harris-black-voters-essence-festival/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Biden also touted his investments for HBCUs, saying \u201cany Black student is capable in college in doing what any White student can do.\u201d Here is where both presidential candidates stand on their records with HBCUs. Biden, Trump and HBCUs During the debate, Biden appeared to\u00a0misstate the amount of investment his administration has contributed to HBCUs,\u00a0\u00a0but CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that his administration has invested more than $16 billion since fiscal year 2021. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0that in September the Biden administration also demanded governors in 16 states address a more than $12 billion funding disparity between land-grant HBCUs and their non-HBCU counterparts. During the Trump administration, relationships with HBCUs were\u00a0frayed\u00a0at times and Trump\u2019s own views on funding the institutions were inconsistent. In 2017, the former president\u00a0questioned\u00a0the constitutional basis for federal funding for HBCUs, saying,\u00a0according to NPR, that \u201cit benefits schools on the basis of race.\u201d At the time, HBCUs and Black education groups applauded the administration\u2019s restoration of year-round Pell Grants,\u00a0among other efforts. In 2019, Trump signed the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education\u00a0(FUTURE)\u00a0Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening HBCUs as well as other minority-serving institutions by providing $255 million annually. But organizations, including the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund,\u00a0pressed the administration\u00a0to further bolster federal funding for HBCUs, some of which have faced dire financial straits. Candidates must understand HBCU needs Lodriguez Murray, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at the UNCF, told CNN that HBCUs have struggled with underfunding \u201csince inception.\u201d HBCUs also\u00a0faced financial challenges\u00a0at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to concerns about how some of the institutions would weather not only budget shortfalls but\u00a0also\u00a0reductions in enrollment. Philanthropic giving to many of the HBCUs increased because of the racial reckoning of 2020, Murray said. That surge in donations, in addition to federal funding,\u00a0he said, helped stabilize many HBCUs. Prior to both\u00a0the\u00a0Trump and Biden administrations, HBCUs experienced steep declines in federal funding from 2003 to 2015, according to\u00a0a report the UNCF released in 2022. However, funding for HBCUs increased during both\u00a0the\u00a0Trump and Biden administrations and, Murray said, funding measures passed during the pandemic \u201chelped HBCUs tremendously.\u201d \u201cCongress took the lead on putting the HBCU funding in those bills and passing them. The third COVID-19 bill, passed under President Biden, included as much funding for HBCUs as both of the first two\u00a0Covid-19 bills\u00a0under President Trump,\u201d he said. Marybeth Gasman, executive director of the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions,\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cHBCUs are strong and resilient institutions.\u201d \u201cThey are that way because of Black people, Black leaders, Black alumni, Black students. They face obstacles but continue to persevere,\u201d Gasman told CNN. However, leaders supporting HBCUs also insisted that there\u2019s still more work to be done. When it comes to\u00a0HBCUs\u00a0and the presidency, Murray said, \u201cthe book has yet to be finished (on) who will offer the next chapters in terms of HBCU support. That\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot currently and we want to make sure that whoever wins this race understands what our needs are.\u201d If reelected, Murray said,\u00a0Biden and Trump\u00a0can demonstrate their commitment to HBCUs by investing in both their infrastructure and the students. \u201cAnd you have to do it at the same time. You can\u2019t do one and then the other because you can\u2019t have great buildings, but then students (can) not afford to come,\u201d he said, adding there should also be an increase in Pell\u00a0Grants\u00a0to help underserved students. \u201cProper facilities will attract strong faculty and they will attract\u00a0world-class\u00a0students, which HBCUs already have, but it will attract even more students,\u201d Murray said. In a report released by the\u00a0Government Accountability Office\u00a0in 2018, the agency found that the HBCUs surveyed said \u201c46 percent of their building space, on average, needs repair or replacement.\u201d Cleveland Gary, chief business development officer for the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an organization that supports HBCUs and predominately Black institutions, encouraged both candidates to create inclusive programs to benefit the next generation of HBCU students. \u201cThat\u2019s putting a stake in the ground, putting your money where your mouth is, and that shows that you truly care about the lifeblood of this country because they are American citizens as well,\u201d he said.
