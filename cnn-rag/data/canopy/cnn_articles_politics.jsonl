The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The House will next need to pass the legislation. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation\u00a0seeks to address\u00a0the nation\u2019s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions. One flashpoint centered around\u00a0flights at Reagan National Airport\u00a0just outside of Washington, DC \u2013 with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package.\u00a0Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments. Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport. The House voted on Wednesday to pass a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, a stopgap move intended to head off a\u00a0looming end-of-week deadline.\u00a0Congress is up against a Friday deadline to reauthorize FAA authorities. This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17. The Senate passed that weeklong extension via unanimous consent on Thursday night, giving the House until next week to send the package to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk for his signature. This story and headline have been updated to reflect additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_07_politics_us-israel-bomb-shipment-pause-rafah-incursion", "text": "The United States\u00a0paused a shipment of bombs to Israel amid concerns over their potential use in a Rafah incursion, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed on Wednesday. Austin said that the US is pausing the shipment of \u201chigh-payload munitions\u201d due to Israel\u2019s possible operations in Rafah without a plan for the civilians there. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to do what\u2019s necessary to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself, but that said, we are currently reviewing some near-term security assistance shipments in the context of unfolding events in Rafah,\u201d Austin said at a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear \u2026 that Israel shouldn\u2019t launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace,\u201d said Austin, \u201cand, again, as we have assessed the situation, we\u2019ve paused one shipment of high-payload munitions.\u201d The decision to pause the shipment appears to send a strong message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has warned for weeks that an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah will occur at some point in the future, even as the US and others have publicly stated that such a ground operation should not occur.\u00a0\u00a0The Biden administration has called for a comprehensive plan to protect more than a million civilians sheltering in Rafah and avoid an expansion of the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the coastal enclave. Israeli officials privately expressed to US officials \u201cdeep frustration\u201d on the pause in shipments as well as the US media briefings on the decision, according to a source briefed on the matter. The officials raised concerns \u201cthat the move may jeopardize the hostage deal negotiations at a critical moment,\u201d the source told CNN. The Israelis also emphasized that US pressure should be directed towards Hamas, the source added. A US official told CNN on Tuesday that the shipment, which was\u00a0held back\u00a0last week, includes 1,800 bombs weighing 2,000\u00a0pounds\u00a0and 1,700 bombs weighing 500\u00a0pounds. \u201cWe are especially focused on the end-use of the 2,000-pound\u00a0bombs and the impact they could have in dense urban settings as we have seen in other parts of Gaza,\u201d the official said. CNN reported over the weekend that one shipment of ammunition to Israel had been paused, but the reason was unclear. Austin said that the US has not made \u201ca final determination\u201d about what will happen with the weapons shipment and emphasized that it was not part of the supplemental spending package recently passed by Congress that included lethal aid for Ukraine as well as Israel. \u201cMy final comment is that we are absolutely committed to continuing to support Israel in its right to defend itself,\u201d said Austin. On Monday, Israel carried out what the US described as a \u201climited\u201d operation in Rafah, taking over the border crossing with Egypt that is a vital lifeline for humanitarian aid. \u201cThis appears to be a limited operation, but of course, much of that depends on what comes next,\u201d\u00a0said State Department spokesman Matt\u00a0Miller\u00a0on Tuesday. \u201cThey have said, I think quite clearly, it\u2019s no secret that they want to conduct a major military operation there. We have made clear that we oppose such an operation.\u201d The US and Israel have been in regular communication about the Israeli military\u2019s plans to conduct a major ground operation in the southern part of Gaza, but the administration has been clear that the plans are far from ready. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen kind of the concepts, but nothing detailed at this point,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen.\u00a0Pat\u00a0Ryder said at a press briefing Monday. Still, Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that a ground operation in Rafah is necessary to keep the pressure on Hamas to release the\u00a0remaining\u00a0hostages and to achieve victory. As Israel\u2019s leadership came closer to a final decision, the US began to review proposed transfers of particular weapons to Israel that might be used in Rafah, the\u00a0US\u00a0official said. The process of carrying out the review began in April and led to the pause in shipments of the two types of bombs. \u201cWe have not made a final determination on how to proceed with this shipment,\u201d the official said. Among the largest conventional weapons in the US arsenal, 2,000 pound bombs can have a devastating impact, especially on a densely populated area such as Gaza. The heavy munitions leave a massive crater and can send deadly shrapnel hundreds of feet from the impact site. A CNN analysis of satellite imagery early in the war found more than 500 impact craters consistent with the use of\u00a0a\u00a0one-ton bomb. Marc Garlasco,\u00a0a former US defense intelligence analyst and former UN war crimes investigator said in December that the density of Israel\u2019s first month of bombardment in Gaza had \u201cnot been seen since Vietnam.\u201d The US is also reviewing the potential sale or transfer of other munitions, including Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits to Israel, the official said. But these\u00a0transfers are not imminent and would occur in the future, the official added. The Pentagon would not comment when asked about pauses in shipments, but insisted that none of this changes the US\u2019s commitment to the defense of Israel. \u201cOur commitment to Israel\u2019s security remains ironclad,\u201d Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing Tuesday. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen that since October 7. You\u2019ve seen us surge security assistance to Israel. So while I\u2019m not going to comment any further I can tell you that our commitments to Israel\u2019s security remains the same.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler, Kylie Atwood and Michael Conte contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/us-israel-bomb-shipment-pause-rafah-incursion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_04_politics_fact-check-trump-time-magazine", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered a bombardment of dishonesty in his interviews with Time magazine. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made at least 32\u00a0false claims in the two April interviews that Time released this week. His serial inaccuracy spanned a wide range of subjects, including the economy, abortion, the NATO military alliance, the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, his legal cases, his record as president and the 2020 election he has relentlessly lied about for more than three years. Time\u00a0published its own fact check\u00a0of some of the 32 claims on Tuesday, when it released its\u00a0cover story on Trump.\u00a0Here is an in-depth CNN debunking. Trump\u2019s record as president Terrorism during Trump\u2019s presidency  Trump claimed that, during his presidency, \u201cthere was very little terrorism. We had none. I had four years of \u2014 we had no terrorism. We didn\u2019t have a World Trade Center knocked down.\u201d Facts First: While it\u2019s true, of course, that Trump\u2019s presidency didn\u2019t feature anything comparable to the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, his claim that \u201cwe had no terrorism\u201d isn\u2019t true. There were a variety of terrorist attacks on the US during his term. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department alleged that a mass murder in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was a terrorist attack carried out in support of ISIS; Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. Trump\u2019s Justice Department also alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia\u2019s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, \u201cwas motivated by jihadist ideology\u201d and was carried out by a longtime \u201cassociate\u201d of al Qaeda. There were various additional terrorist attacks during Trump\u2019s presidency. Notably, Trump\u2019s Justice Department said it was a \u201cdomestic terrorist attack\u201d when one of Trump\u2019s supporters mailed improvised explosive devices to CNN, prominent Democratic officials and other people in 2018. In 2019, a White supremacist pleaded guilty to multiple charges in New York, including first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, for killing a Black man in March 2017 to try to start a race war. And Trump\u2019s Justice Department described a 2019 shooting massacre at a Walmart in Texas as an act of domestic terrorism; the gunman who killed 23 people was targeting Latinos. Border wall construction  Talking about his wall on the border with Mexico, Trump said, \u201cI completed what I said I was going to do, much more than I said I was going to do.\u201d Facts Fist: This is false; Trump didn\u2019t achieve nearly as much wall construction as he had pledged on the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016.\u00a0 Trump repeatedly said in\u00a02015 and 2016 that \u201cwe need\u201d 1,000 miles of wall to protect the southern border, with another 1,000 miles already protected by natural barriers. But not even close to 1,000 miles were built during his presidency; official federal statistics put the total construction at 458 miles, and only 52 miles of that total was new \u201cprimary\u201d wall built where no barriers had previously existed. When Trump left office, there were about 280 miles of the border where wall construction had been planned but not executed. The departure of Attorney General William Barr Asked why voters should trust him with a second term when many of the people who worked closely with him during his first term now say he doesn\u2019t deserve another term, Trump said, \u201cWell, they don\u2019t because I didn\u2019t like them.Some of those people I fired. Bill Barr, I fired Bill Barr. I didn\u2019t want him.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is false. Barr\u00a0resigned as attorney general in December 2020; he was not fired, as a White House official confirmed to CNN at the time. Trump had been frustrated with Barr over Barr\u2019s\u00a0public rejection\u00a0of his lies about mass election fraud and\u00a0had been seriously considering firing Barr the same month, but Trump did not do so \u2014 and he made a positive public statement about Barr upon the resignation, writing on social media: \u201cJust had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family.\u201d The US military presence in South Korea Trump claimed that, before he negotiated a better deal, South Korea was paying far too little \u201cfor 40,000 troops that we had there.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s \u201c40,000\u201d number is inaccurate. As of December 31, 2016, less than a month before Trump took office, the US had 26,878 military personnel in South Korea, including 23,468 on active duty, according to\u00a0official statistics from the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center. As of December 31, 2018, less than two months before the Trump administration signed a new deal with South Korea, the total was 29,389 US military personnel in South Korea, including 26,311 on active duty. The US financial arrangement with South Korea Trump claimed that he got South Korea to agree to pay the US \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d for its military presence there, but \u201cnow probably now that I\u2019m gone, they\u2019re paying very little.\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know that they renegotiated the deal I made. And they\u2019re paying very little. But they paid us billions, many billions of dollars, for us having troops there. From what I\u2019m hearing, they were able to renegotiate with the Biden Administration and bring that number way, way down to what it was before, which was almost nothing.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump made two false claims here. First, it\u2019s not even close to true that the Biden administration permitted South Korea to pay \u201calmost nothing\u201d for the US military presence there. In fact, as\u00a0Time noted in its own fact check, South Korea agreed under President Joe Biden to pay more than it had been paying during the Trump era. Completing negotiations that began under Trump, South Korea\u00a0agreed in March 2021 to a 2021 payment increase of 13.9%\u00a0\u2014 meaning its payment that year would be about $1 billion \u2014 and then additional increases in 2022 through 2025 tied to increases in South Korea\u2019s defense budget.\u00a0 Second, it\u2019s also not true that South Korea paid \u201calmost nothing\u201d for the US troop presence before Trump came along. South Korea\u00a0agreed to pay the US about $867 million in 2014\u00a0and,\u00a0through 2018, to increase the payments annually based on the rate of inflation. The Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2023 report: \u201cIn the past, South Korea generally paid for 40%-50% (over $800 million annually) of the total non-personnel costs of maintaining the U.S. troop presence in South Korea.\u201d Trump\u2019s popularity in Israel After boasting about what he did for Israel during his presidency, Trump said, \u201cThe people of Israel appreciate it. I have like a 98% \u2014 I have the highest approval numbers.\u201d Facts First: Trump does not have a 98% approval rating in Israel. Tamar Hermann, an expert on Israeli public opinion who is a political science professor and a senior research fellow at the Israeli Democracy Institute, said in an email to CNN this week: \u201cIndeed in certain segments of the Jewish public (mainly the Right) Trump was very popular during his presidency. However, in no serious survey did he hit 98% as far as the general public was concerned.\u201d A 2018 poll found that 59% of Jewish Israelis had a favorable view of Trump. A poll late in the 2020 presidential election found that 70% of Jewish Israelis thought a Trump victory would be best for Israel\u2019s interests (versus 13% who chose Biden). A poll released this March found that 44% of Israeli adults wanted Trump elected in 2024, 30% wanted Biden and 26% were unsure. Hermann said President Bill Clinton was more popular in Israel during his presidency than Trump was during his, and that \u201cTrump has lost much of his popularity here after leaving the White House because of his hectic/sometimes antagonistic statements.\u201d Trump and the law on monument destruction  Trump repeated his familiar claim that he had passed a law, or revived an old law, to give an automatic 10-year prison sentence to anyone who desecrates a monument. He said, \u201cI mean, if you look at what happened in Washington with monuments, I passed the law. I took an old law, brought it into effect that you get a minimum of 10 years without any adjustment if you do anything to desecrate a monument and everything was immediately set up\u2026\u00a0I signed into effect a law that gives you 10 years, not one day less than 10 years of prison if you desecrate a monument. You know, that was very effective.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. He didn\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d any \u201claw\u201d about damage to monuments, and he did not impose an automatic 10-year sentence for damaging monuments. In fact, the executive order he issued on the subject, in 2020, did not create any mandatory minimum or even require any increase in sentences. Rather, the executive order simply directed the attorney general to \u201cprioritize\u201d investigations and prosecutions of monument-destruction cases and declared that it is federal policy to prosecute such cases to the fullest extent permitted under existing law \u2013 including one that allowed a sentence of up to 10 years in prison for willfully damaging federal property if the damage exceeds $100. The executive order did nothing to force judges to impose a 10-year sentence. Trump, Minneapolis and the National Guard  Trump spoke of his willingness to use the military to assist with the massive deportation initiative he has promised. He said, \u201cWhen we talk military, generally speaking, I talk National Guard. I\u2019ve used the National Guard in Minneapolis.And if I didn\u2019t use it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d have Minneapolis standing right now, because it was really bad.\u201d Facts First: Though Trump has repeatedly claimed that he is the person who deployed the National Guard in Minneapolis during the unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, is actually the person who did so. Walz first activated the Minnesota National Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\u00a0 Trump claimed in 2020, as he has since, that he deployed the Guard in Minnesota because the Democratic governor was unwilling to do it. That\u2019s not true, either. In addition, Walz\u2019s office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul \u2014 cities also run by Democrats. You can read more details here. NATO The US share of NATO funding  Criticizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance and its funding structure, Trump said, \u201cI went, I looked at the numbers, and I said, wait a minute, the United States is paying for NATO. We\u2019re paying for close to 100% of NATO.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members \u2013 a large majority, but not \u201cclose to 100%.\u201d And Trump\u2019s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO\u2019s organizational expenses and are set based on each country\u2019s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016. \u00a0 The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% \u201cto placate Trump\u201d and is a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance\u2019s total GDP. NATO countries\u2019 military spending  Trump said of NATO members: \u201cI just want them to pay their bills.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t need to renegotiate the terms of the treaty. All I need to do is have them pay their bills. They don\u2019t pay their bills.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. NATO\u2019s target of having its members each spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense is a self-described \u201cguideline\u201d that does not create \u201cbills.\u201d In fact, the guideline doesn\u2019t require payments to NATO or the US at all; it simply requires each country to spend on its own defense programs. And Trump\u2019s categorical claim that NATO members \u201cdon\u2019t pay their bills\u201d is now inaccurate in an additional way. While a majority of NATO members have traditionally not met the 2% target, NATO\u2019s chief said in February that 18 of the 31 members subject to the guideline were expected to hit the target this year. NATO\u2019s funding and stability Trump said, \u201cI did a hell of a job getting money for NATO because nobody else \u2014 NATO had no money. NATO couldn\u2019t have even prosecuted what they\u2019re doing right now. They had no money.\u201d He also said, \u201cThey had no cash, they were dying.\u201d Facts First: While NATO chief Stoltenberg did give Trump partial credit for prodding member countries to increase their defense spending, it\u2019s just not true that \u201cNATO had no money\u201d before Trump became president. Defense spending by NATO members other than the US was about $262 billion in 2016, certainly not nothing. (It rose to about $314 billion in 2020, Trump\u2019s last full year in office.) And there\u2019s simply no basis in reality for the claim that NATO was \u201cdying\u201d before Trump came along; Lagadec noted to CNN in 2023, when Trump made similar comments, that the only NATO member that had given \u201cany sign\u201d in recent years that it was thinking about leaving the alliance \u201cwas\u2026 the US, under Trump.\u201d The cost of NATO\u2019s headquarters  Continuing to criticize NATO, Trump claimed that, before his presidency, \u201cAll they were doing was building stupid office buildings. They built a $3 billion office building.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s $3 billion figure, which he has used before, is not close to accurate. NATO told CNN in 2020 that the headquarters building in Brussels, Belgium, was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.26 billion at Wednesday exchange rates \u2014 certainly an expensive facility, but less than half what Trump has repeatedly claimed. The Covid-19 pandemic Perceptions of pandemics Speaking of his response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump said, \u201cEverybody thought of a pandemic as an ancient problem. No longer a modern problem, right?\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that \u201ceverybody\u201d thought of pandemics as an \u201cancient problem\u201d that was not a problem in the \u201cmodern\u201d age. As CNN noted when Trump made similar false claims in 2020, the US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump\u2019s own administration had warned for years, prior to Covid-19, that the US was at risk from a pandemic. Some of their warnings specifically mentioned the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic. For example, the US intelligence community wrote in its 2018 worldwide threat assessment, and again in its 2019 assessment, of the risk to the US posed by a potential future influenza or coronavirus pandemic. The 2019 version said, \u201cWe assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.\u201d During Trump\u2019s first year as president, officials from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention participated in a pandemic simulation with officials from other countries; a World Bank official told the Washington Post at the time that the simulation\u2019s purpose was \u201cto prepare much more systematically to be ready for the 100 percent probability we will be dealing with this again. Probably sooner than we expect.\u2019\u201d In response to similar Trump claims in 2020, Harvard University epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch, director of Harvard\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, told CNN: \u201cThis was foreseeable, and foreseen, weeks and months ago, and only now is the White House coming out of denial and heading straight into saying it could not have been foreseen.\u201d Pandemic supplies Speaking about his response to Covid-19, Trump repeated a claim he made repeatedly in 2020 \u2014 that \u201cthe cupboards were totally bare\u201d and that the US had no supplies for dealing with the pandemic. Among other things, he said, \u201cWe had no ventilators. We had nothing.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0It\u2019s not true that the US had \u201cno ventilators\u201d or \u201ctotally bare\u201d cupboards when the pandemic hit, though it\u2019s true that some communities experienced early-pandemic shortages of some critical supplies and that the federal Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s supplies of some items, such as\u00a0high-quality masks, were low. CNN repeatedly\u00a0debunked\u00a0this \u201cno ventilators\u201d claim in 2020. A spokesperson for the Trump-era Department of Health and Human Services\u00a0told CNN\u00a0in June 2020 that, when the pandemic hit, there had been about 19,000 ventilators in the federal\u00a0Strategic National Stockpile\u00a0for \u201cmany years,\u201d including 16,660 ventilators that were ready for immediate use in March 2020 \u2014\u00a0far more than the Trump administration had actually ended up distributing during the first three months of the crisis.\u00a0The spokesperson confirmed that none of those 16,660 were purchased by the Trump administration. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act in the spring of 2020 to accelerate the manufacturing of additional ventilators, and his administration sent thousands of ventilators to other countries in 2020. Trade and the economy The trade deficit with China\u00a0 Talking about his proposal for a significant tariff on US imports from China, Trump said, \u201cChina was going along making $500 to $600 billion a year and nobody was ever even mentioning it until I came along.\u201d Trump\u00a0has\u00a0used such language for years\u00a0when speaking about the trade deficit with China, the annual difference between what the US imports from and exports to China. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false.\u00a0The US has\u00a0never\u00a0had a $500 billion or $600 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China. The pre-Trump record for a goods deficit with China was about $367 billion in 2015.\u00a0 The goods deficit hit a new record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years (and under $300 billion under Biden in 2023, the lowest since 2010). Past presidents and tariffs on China\u00a0 Defending his tariffs on Chinese products, Trump said, \u201cLook, I took in billions of dollars from China. Nobody else ever did anything on China.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Temporarily leaving aside the fact that\u00a0study\u00a0after\u00a0study\u00a0has found that Americans, not China, overwhelmingly paid for Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products, it\u2019s not true that \u201cnobody else ever did anything on China.\u201d The US has had tariffs on goods from China\u00a0since the late 1700s; as president,\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0imposed\u00a0new tariffs on goods from China;\u00a0FactCheck.org\u00a0reported\u00a0that the US generated an \u201caverage of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\u201d This Trump claim to Time was a vaguer version of his\u00a0oft-repeated\u00a0false\u00a0claim\u00a0that no previous president generated even \u201c10 cents\u201d from tariffs on China. Trade with the European Union Talking about trade policy, Trump said, \u201cThe E.U. is very tough with us.They don\u2019t take our foreign products. They don\u2019t take our cars. We take Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and BMW. They don\u2019t take our cars.\u201d He said at another point in the interview, \u201cThey don\u2019t want anything from us. It\u2019s like a one-way street.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0It\u2019s not true either that the European Union won\u2019t take American products in general or won\u2019t accept American cars in particular, though some US exports face EU trade barriers and though US automakers have often had a hard time gaining popularity with European consumers. The US\u00a0exported about $369 billion\u00a0in goods to the European Union in 2023 (while importing about $577 billion from the EU that year), federal figures show. According to a December 2023\u00a0report\u00a0from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports \u2014 importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles\u00a0made by European automakers at plants in the US.) The EU\u2019s Eurostat statistical office\u00a0says\u00a0that car imports from the US hit a new peak in 2020, Trump\u2019s last full year in office, at a value of about 11 billion euro. Moody\u2019s and the Trump-era economy Cortellessa told Trump that while there\u2019s no doubt the economy was strong during his presidency, \u201cMoody\u2019s did say that your trade war with China cost the U.S. economy $316 billion and [almost] 300,000 jobs.\u201d (Time noted in the transcript that the $316 billion figure was actually from Bloomberg Economics.) Trump responded, \u201cYeah. Moody\u2019s doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. We had the greatest economy in history. And Moody\u2019s acknowledges that.\u201d Facts First: Moody\u2019s does not \u201cacknowledge\u201d that Trump had the greatest economy in history. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I said or believe,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an email to CNN this week. Zandi continued: \u201cThe economy was weakening in 2019 going into 2020 under the weight of the higher tariffs.\u00a0Manufacturing and agriculture were contracting. The yield curve had inverted, suggesting 2020 would be an even tougher year even if the pandemic had not hit.\u00a0And inflation was sub-optimal at the time, as the Fed was working hard to lift inflation. So, I would not characterize it as \u2018the greatest economy of all time.\u2019\u201d Zandi spoke in the fall of 2019 about Moody\u2019s modeling that found that Trump was likely to win in 2020 if the economy held up. Of course, the economy was then devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. The January 6 attack January 6 deaths Talking about the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters tried to prevent the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory, Trump said, \u201cAnd whether you like it or not, nobody died other than Ashli.\u201d He was referring to rioter Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was shot to death by a US Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a broken window into the Speaker\u2019s Lobby outside the House of Representatives. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cnobody died other than Ashli\u201d is false. Three other Trump supporters who were at the Capitol on January 6 died in medical emergencies, two from natural causes and one from accidental amphetamine intoxication, according to the chief medical examiner for Washington, DC.\u00a0 In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day. The medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told the Washington Post that \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition\u201d; experts subsequently noted to CNN that stressful or traumatic events can lead to strokes. The Jan. 6 committee and Trump\u2019s \u2018peacefully and patriotically\u2019 comment Defending his conduct on January 6, 2021, Trump told Time, \u201cNumber one, I made a speech that was peaceful and patriotic that nobody reports. Nobody talks about it: peacefully and patriotically. Nobody talks. You know, the committee never used those words.They refused to allow those words.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that the House select committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol \u201cnever used\u201d or \u201crefused to allow\u201d the part of Trump\u2019s pre-riot speech in which he said, \u201cI know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\u201d The committee explicitly mentioned the \u201cpeacefully and patriotically\u201d comment in its official final report \u2014 though the committee also noted that this remark was at odds with much of the rest of the speech. The report said: \u201cPresident Trump used the phrase scripted for him by his White House speechwriters, \u2018peacefully and patriotically\u2019 once, about 20 minutes into his speech. Then he spent the next 50-or-so minutes amping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own Vice President and Republican Members of Congress, and exhorting the crowd to fight.\u201d Nancy Pelosi and January 6 Speaking about the attack on the Capitol, Trump repeated his familiar claim about the supposed failures of Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was the speaker of the House of Representatives at the time. He said, \u201cI\u2019m the one that tried to stop it. I offered 10,000 soldiers and Nancy Pelosi turned me down.\u201d After calling himself \u201ca very innocent man,\u201d Trump added, \u201cNancy Pelosi is responsible, because she refused to take the 10,000 soldiers or National Guardsmen that I offered. She refused to take them.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Pelosi turned down a Trump offer of 10,000 soldiers on January 6. In fact, she would not even have had the power to turn down such an offer if she had received one \u2014 which she has said she never did. Pelosi\u2019s office has explicitly said she was never presented with an offer of 10,000 troops, telling CNN in 2022 that claims to the contrary are \u201clies.\u201d In addition, the speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which\u00a0reports to the president\u00a0(whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army). And contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated claims, the speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the\u00a0Capitol Police Board, a body that\u00a0includes\u00a0the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. The House select committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol\u00a0found \u201cno evidence\u201d\u00a0Trump gave any actual order for 10,000 Guard troops. Christopher Miller, Trump\u2019s acting defense secretary at the time of the attack on the Capitol,\u00a0testified\u00a0to the House select committee that Trump had, in a phone call on January 5, 2021, briefly and informally floated the idea of having 10,000 troops present on January 6 but did not issue any directive to that effect. Miller said, \u201cI interpreted it as a bit of presidential banter or President Trump banter that you all are familiar with, and in no way, shape, or form did I interpret that as an order or direction.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal cases Biden and Trump\u2019s New York trial When Time reporter Eric Cortellessa told Trump, \u201cI just want to say for the record, there\u2019s no evidence that President Biden directed this prosecution against you,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cOh sure there is.\u201d He said Cortellessa\u2019s assertion is \u201cso wrong.\u201d Facts First: Cortellessa is right, Trump is wrong. There is no evidence that Biden has had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution over Trump\u2019s alleged falsification of business records \u2014 and Bragg is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government.\u00a0 As Trump has in the past, he invoked a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, to support his claim to Time; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney\u2019s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo investigated Trump\u2019s charity and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was involved in bringing various lawsuits against the Trump administration. Trump\u2019s comment about the district attorney When Cortellessa told Trump that \u201cyou said Alvin Bragg should be prosecuted,\u201d Trump said, \u201cWhen did I say Alvin Bragg should be prosecuted?\u201d Cortellessa said, \u201cIt was at a rally.\u201d Trump responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think I said that, no.\u201d Facts First: Trump said it. In an April 2023 speech after he was indicted by a grand jury in Bragg\u2019s prosecution, Trump said, \u201cThe criminal is the district attorney, because he illegally leaked massive amounts of grand jury information. For which he should be prosecuted. Or, at a minimum, he should resign.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t clear what Trump was referring to; there is no evidence that Bragg committed a crime.) Trump and Russia Trump\u2019s 2016 comment about Russia Asked about his remark late last year that he would not be a dictator \u201cother than day one\u201d of his next presidency, Trump said he was just joking when he said it. He then invoked a controversial comment he made during his 2016 campaign, in which he asked Russia for help obtaining thousands of deleted Hillary Clinton emails. He said to Time: \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening.\u2019 Remember \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening?\u2019\u201d He said, \u201cThat was said in the exact same vein. \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening.\u2019 Everybody knows that was said sarcastically. But they cut off the laughter. You know, they cut it off immediately. As soon as it was \u2014 immediately, it was cut off. But that was said, sarcastically, a joke, it was in jest.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that the media \u201ccut off the laughter\u201d after his \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening\u201d remark is false. He made the remark at a news conference in July 2016, with a straight face, and the full footage shows no audible laughter in the room. Media coverage of the Trump campaign and Russia Decrying media coverage of his 2016 campaign\u2019s connections to Russia, Trump said, \u201cYou know, I have a lawsuit against the Pulitzer Foundation over the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, because they talked about it for two and a half years and it turned out to be a total scam. And then certain writers got Nobel Prizes.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0As Time\u00a0noted in its own fact check, no journalist involved in the\u00a0Pulitzer-winning coverage\u00a0has received a Nobel Prize.\u00a0 The Pulitzer, in the National Reporting category, was awarded to the staffs of the New York Times and the Washington Post for \u201cdeeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation\u2019s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect\u2019s transition team and his eventual administration.\u201d The Pulitzer Prize Board said it commissioned two independent reviews of the winning work after complaints from Trump and others; the board\u00a0said in a 2022 statement\u00a0that the separate reviews both found \u201cthat no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.\u201d The 2020 election The legitimacy of the 2020 election\u00a0 Trump repeated his usual lies about the 2020 presidential election, claiming to have \u201cproof\u201d it was \u201cstolen\u201d and also that opponents \u201cused Covid to cheat and lots of other things to cheat.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0All of this remains false.\u00a0The 2020 election was not rigged, Trump lost fair and square to Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, his opponents did not cheat, and there is no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state. Trump\u2019s post about the 2020 election and the Constitution Time reporter Eric\u00a0Cortellessa asked Trump, \u201cYou once wrote on Truth Social that you might have to terminate parts of the Constitution. What did you mean by that?\u201d Trump responded, \u201cI never said that at all. I never said that at all. When I talk about certain things, we are, there is nothing more important than our Constitution.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cI never said that at all\u201d is\u00a0false. He\u00a0wrote\u00a0on his social media platform Truth Social in December 2022: \u201cDo you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.\u201d One can quibble about whether Trump was saying he personally might have to terminate parts of the Constitution if elected president again or whether he wanted others to immediately ignore parts of the Constitution. But his categorical denial that he had said any such thing went way too far. Assorted other claims Legal scholars and Roe v. Wade  Speaking about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights across the country, Trump said, \u201cEvery legal scholar, Democrat, Republican, and other wanted that issue back at the states.You know, Roe v. Wade was always considered very bad law. Very bad.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted the issue of abortion law returned to the states \u2014 in other words, wanted Roe v. Wade overturned \u2014 is false. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated to CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April. \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said Monday. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d said another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university\u2019s Health Law and Policy Program. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in a Monday interview: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d It is true that some legal scholars who support abortion rights wished that Roe had been written differently; the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of them. But Ziegler noted that although \u201cthere was a cottage industry of legal scholars kind of rewriting Roe \u2013 \u2018what Roe should\u2019ve said\u2019 \u2014 that isn\u2019t saying Roe should\u2019ve been overturned. Those are very different things.\u201d You can read more here. Migrants from China Talking about illegal immigration, Trump claimed that \u201cwe have a major force that\u2019s forming in our country, when you see that over the last three weeks, 29,000 people came in from China, and they\u2019re all fighting age, and they\u2019re mostly males.\u201d Facts First: There\u2019s no basis for the claim that 29,000 Chinese migrants have entered the country \u201cover the last three weeks.\u201d Official federal data from US Customs and Border Protection shows that through the first half of the 2024 fiscal year, up to the end of March, 24,376 Chinese nationals had been encountered at the southern border. That\u2019s a smaller number than the one Trump used, and it\u2019s for six months rather than \u201cthree weeks.\u201d The official data shows 41,970 total nationwide border encounters with Chinese nationals in the first six months of the fiscal year, again nowhere close to the pace Trump described. Official border data for April is not yet available, but there\u2019s no public reporting about the April 1-12 period that would corroborate Trump\u2019s claim about the three weeks prior. Also, there is no evidence for Trump\u2019s repeated suggestions that Chinese migrants are trying to form some sort of military force in the US. Crime Biden and crimes Trump claimed that if the Supreme Court rules that presidents don\u2019t have criminal immunity, \u201cBiden, probably nothing to do with me, he would be prosecuted for 20 different acts, because he\u2019s created such. You take a look at not only his criminal acts of taking a lot of money and being a Manchurian Candidate.\u201d (Trump went on to describe what he portrayed as Biden\u2019s foreign policy failures.) Facts First: This claim is nonsense. House Republicans\u2019 investigation into Biden and his family members has not found any evidence of the president committing crimes or illegally receiving any money. (They have found he received checks from his brother James Biden, which is not illegal, and the evidence strongly suggests those checks were loan repayments, as James Biden has said they were.) There is no basis for the claim that Biden is a \u201cManchurian Candidate,\u201d a term often used to describe a candidate who is controlled by a foreign adversary such as China. Violent crime in 2023 Trump claimed that figures published by the FBI that\u00a0show a roughly 6% drop in violent crime in 2023\u00a0(and a roughly 13% drop in homicides) are \u201cfake numbers.\u201d He added that \u201cthe FBI gave fake numbers,\u201d \u201cthe FBI fudged the numbers\u00a0and other people fudged numbers,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s a lie\u201d - insisting that \u201cthere is no way that crime went down over the last year.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims are false. All available data makes clear that violent crime did decline last year. The 2023 quarterly statistics reported by the FBI are not\u00a0\u201cfake,\u201d though they are preliminary figures subject to future revision and they do not cover every community in the country. Crime data expert Jeff Asher said in an email to CNN this week: \u201cWhile it is not clear just how precise the FBI\u2019s quarterly numbers will be when the final numbers are released in October, the quarterly figures released by the FBI come from more than 13,000 agencies and almost certainly accurately represent the scope and direction of crime trends in the US in 2023.\u201d (Asher said about 16,500 law enforcement agencies are eligible to report data.) It\u2019s true that the preliminary 2023 data is not the final data; Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said the final numbers could certainly show a decline smaller than the currently reported decline of 5.7%. It\u2019s also true that the preliminary data has various shortcomings, including the fact that some agencies haven\u2019t yet provided their figures to the FBI (some may not submit at all). And Asher said the preliminary data includes some apparent errors that will be fixed later. But none of this means the FBI has deliberately \u201cfudged\u201d the data as Trump suggested, nor that there was actually a crime increase last year. Asher noted that other data sources \u2013 including city-by-city murder data collected by his firm, publicly published crime data from more than a dozen states, and provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mortality data \u2013 all point to the same broad conclusion: \u201ca large decline in murder/homicide and a smaller decline in violent crime in 2023.\u201d \u201cGiven the multitude of data sources pointing to the same widespread decline I\u2019d say the FBI quarterly data is trustworthy in terms of the overarching trend while there still being a fair amount of uncertainty as to how large the declines in murder and violent crime may have been,\u201d Asher said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/politics/fact-check-trump-time-magazine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_henry-cuellar-bribery-case-consultants-plea-deal", "text": "Rep. Henry Cuellar\u2019s\u00a0former\u00a0campaign manager and another political operative\u00a0have agreed to\u00a0plead guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating with the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of the Texas\u00a0Democrat, according to court\u00a0documents unsealed Wednesday. Mina\u00a0Colin Strother, Cuellar\u2019s\u00a0former\u00a0campaign manager and former chief of staff, and Florencio \u201cLencho\u201d Rendon, a political consultant and businessman from San Antonio,\u00a0agreed to\u00a0plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in March. Cuellar and his wife,\u00a0Imelda,\u00a0were indicted last week on suspicion of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities \u2013\u00a0a\u00a0bank\u00a0headquartered in Mexico City\u00a0and an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan. Both the congressman and his wife have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. Cuellar has publicly asserted his innocence, saying\u00a0in a statement last week\u00a0that \u201cboth my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.\u201d According to court documents, Rendon and Cuellar concocted the bribery scheme in 2015 after learning that the Mexican bank\u00a0needed help\u00a0doing business within the United States. Rendon signed on to a phony \u201cconsulting agreement\u201d with the bank for $15,000 per month, prosecutors say. Most of the money was eventually sent to the Cuellars, prosecutors allege, but Rendon didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to send money directly to Imelda. Cuellar then suggested recruiting Strother as a middleman,\u00a0prosecutors say. The alleged plot\u00a0evolved into an arrangement where\u00a0Rendon would send $11,000 per month to Strother, who in turn would send $10,000 to\u00a0a company owned by\u00a0Imelda Cuellar, according to court documents. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to\u00a0Cuellar\u2019s wife, according to court filings. The Cuellars are not named in Strother\u2019s and Rendon\u2019s plea deal agreements, but both of their case numbers are listed as related cases to Cuellar\u2019s in court records. Specific details laid out in the plea agreements also exactly match details in the indictment against Cuellar. Cuellar\u2019s attorney, Chris Flood, told CNN in a statement, \u201cAs long as\u00a0Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried. As we all know, the government can convince people to tell them what they want to hear rather than the truth. I don\u2019t know what they are saying, but as long as they stick to the truth, we are not worried.\u201d CNN has reached out to attorneys for Rendon and Strother for comment. This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/henry-cuellar-bribery-case-consultants-plea-deal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_politics_biden-speech-israel-analysis", "text": "The political rawness of the moment, as Israel pounds Gaza and outrage rocks American college campuses, means President Joe Biden\u2019s big speech Tuesday condemning antisemitism is most notable for what he left unsaid. The president denounced hate against Jews, which has occurred at some college protests, called out extremists who obscure the truth of the Holocaust and movingly told Jewish Americans they belong in the country amid what he called a \u201cferocious\u201d surge in antisemitism that has left many questioning their safety. \u201cI see your fear, your hurt and your pain. Let me reassure you, as your president, you\u2019re not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,\u201d Biden said. The speech was closely watched given the turmoil in the Middle East and its stunning political reaction in the US. Biden might have caused offense had he been overtly political at a Capitol Hill event marking one of history\u2019s most vicious crimes \u2013 the Nazi genocide against Jews. But everyone understood the context. It will therefore not be forgotten that while addressing current developments, Biden refused to dance between his deeply felt support for Israel and criticism from his own party for not tempering Israel\u2019s assault in Gaza. The president did not send any cautionary message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appears to be moving toward an offensive against Hamas in Rafah that Biden\u2019s administration fears could cause human carnage. The most pro-Israel president of modern times in fact stressed the inviolability of his support whatever happens. \u201cMy commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\u201d he said at a Holocaust Memorial Museum event on Capitol Hill. Biden also made few efforts to try to appease fury among progressive Democrats and Arab Americans, including in the critical swing state of Michigan, over his support for Israel in its response to the Hamas terrorist attacks, which killed 1,200 people in October. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The reaction of Biden\u2019s most liberal Democratic critics to his speech could be important amid growing fears of some in the party that the war could critically fracture his coalition ahead of November\u2019s election. After encountering protesters chanting \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d at campaign events, Biden also made no clear reference to the extreme suffering of Gazans during the current crisis, although he did add that his administration was tirelessly working to end the conflict through a diplomatic initiative in the Middle East. He took an uncompromising line on campus protests. While praising the right to free speech as a fundamental American value, he condemned reported instances when some Jewish students have faced antisemitic taunting. \u201cDestroying property is not peaceful protest. It\u2019s against the law. We\u2019re not a lawless country. We\u2019re civil society. We uphold the rule of law, and no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves,\u201d Biden said. An attempt to reset the narrative Biden\u2019s speech harked back to an age when presidents sought to address the nation, to reset a controversial debate and to control a narrative at a politically sensitive moment. Whether this is even possible in the tumult of the social media age is questionable. But Biden\u2019s remarks were an unequivocal statement of a position of principle six months ahead of his election rematch with his predecessor Donald Trump. The comparison between the candidates is rarely as starkly on show as on Tuesday morning. While Biden was addressing the nation in the ceremonial trappings of the presidency, Trump was in court in Manhattan listening to a key witness, former adult film star Stormy Daniels, testify about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump during his hush money trial arising from the 2016 election. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case. At any other time, Biden\u2019s choice of words and subject matter would not have been controversial. Presidents habitually warn about the dangers of forgetting or misrepresenting one of history\u2019s most heinous crimes \u2014 the slaughter of around 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany. But Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks has sparked a worldwide protest movement fueled by high-profile demonstrations at many American college campuses. Some of the domestic fury toward Biden is rooted in a view of pro-Palestinian advocates and family members of Gazans in the United States that Israel\u2019s bombings of civilian areas where Hamas is embedded represent a crime against humanity tantamount to genocide. But Biden made clear that there was no justification for the October 7 terror attacks, implicitly dismissing efforts from some pro-Palestinian supporters to point out that they followed years of Israeli repression against the people of Gaza. In doing so, he aligned himself with the view of many Israelis that the attacks \u2014 the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust \u2014 sprung from the same desire to wipe Jews off the planet and threaten Israel\u2019s right to exist. He condemned \u201ctoo many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 \u2014 including Hamas\u2019 appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It\u2019s absolutely despicable \u2014 and it must stop,\u201d raising his voice at the end of the sentence. \u201cNow, here we are \u2014 not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later \u2014 and people are already forgetting. They\u2019re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. \u2026 I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\u201d Johnson compares anger on some American campuses to Nazism Everything a president does is inherently political, and landmark speeches always address multiple audiences. There\u2019s no doubt that Biden\u2019s speech was carefully watched in Israel and may be interpreted as a sign there may be no price for Netanyahu to pay if he ignores US warnings about a Rafah offensive to rout out Hamas leadership \u2014 even if Biden\u2019s credibility is called into question. While Biden\u2019s approach Tuesday may irk progressives, it might offer some cover on his right flank. Republicans, led by Trump, are portraying campus protests as left-wing extremism that Biden can\u2019t control and are calling for a new strongman president to restore order. The president can ill afford such a view to take hold among centrist swing state voters. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who has led House Republicans in painting campus protests as a symbol of an extremist liberal rot in elite schools, on Tuesday used the Holocaust memorial event to conjure his most graphic analogy yet. \u201cGerman universities \u2026 were at the heart of the renaissance and intellectual life. But it was at those same elite centers of learning where Jewish faculty and students were expelled, where anti-Jewish courses were introduced, and where professors performed horrific pseudo-science experiments on Jews brought from nearby concentration camps,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe remember what happened then, and today, we are witnessing American universities quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.\u201d As heinous as the abuse faced by Jewish students at US universities is, there is currently no true parallel between the Nazis\u2019 organized project to destroy Judaism to create a White master race. In fact, in recent years, anti-Jewish extremism has bubbled up more from the far-right in protests like the one in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that Trump was equivocal in condemning \u2014 which Biden has said convinced him to run for the White House. Trump reached for Nazi imagery over the weekend to falsely accuse Biden of being behind his multiple legal threats when he blasted the president and Democrats for running a \u201cGestapo\u201d administration. It was only the latest instance when political figures of the right and the left coopted false historical parallels for political gain. Some progressives have, for instance, compared Trump\u2019s autocratic tendencies to 1930s tyrants in a way that cheapens some of history\u2019s horrors and obscures real understanding of the exact nature of the threat to democracy that the GOP presumptive nominee may pose. Understanding history and preventing it from being manipulated for political gain was a major focus of Biden\u2019s speech, which was delivered on the 79th anniversary of VE Day, when the allies defeated Nazism in World War II. \u201cNever forgetting means we must keep telling the story. We must keep teaching the truth. We must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. The truth is, we\u2019re at risk of people not knowing the truth,\u201d Biden said. It was an especially poignant message coming from an 81-year-old president who was born during the war against Nazism and who, unlike today\u2019s young people, grew up when the dark shadow of the 1940s was a vivid memory shared by people who lived through it rather than a second-hand experience in history classes and movies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/biden-speech-israel-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_georgia-trump-fani-willis-appeal", "text": "The Georgia Court of Appeals will consider an effort by Donald Trump and his co-defendants to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis from the 2020 election subversion case. In a brief order Wednesday, the court said it will hear the appeal from Trump and others challenging the ruling from Judge Scott McAfee that allowed Willis to remain on the case. No trial date has been set in the sprawling election subversion conspiracy case against Trump, and the decision to consider the appeal is another sign that pre-trial efforts to delay a trial are succeeding. Tuesday, a federal judge in Florida indefinitely postponed Trump\u2019s trial on mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. And the Supreme Court has yet to rule on Trump\u2019s arguments that he has full immunity for actions while president, an issue that has stopped the federal trial on January 6, 2021-related charges. Willis\u2019 office declined to comment on the order. Trump attorney Steve Sadow said the former president \u201clooks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\u201d In March, after what amounted to a mini-trial where attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants sought to prove their case against Willis and her prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade, the Fulton County judge presiding ultimately decided Willis would be allowed to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down. McAfee found there was not enough evidence to firmly prove Willis financially benefited from her relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair. Willis testified that she paid Wade back for the expenses in cash. Weeks after McAfee\u2019s ruling, Trump and several co-defendants appealed, arguing that Willis \u201chas covered herself and her office in scandal and disrepute, as she has squandered her credibility and repeatedly and flagrantly violated the heightened ethical standards demanded of her position.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/georgia-trump-fani-willis-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

That is the obituary headline of a man who used his wonderful life to make a difference in American politics and public policy. A New\u00a0York-born\u00a0son of a power plant manager and a homemaker who was the first in his family to go to college, Quinn was ambitious and service-minded from the start. It was at the prestigious Georgetown University law school where Quinn got the political bug that led him to Capitol Hill, campaigns and eventually to the White House as President Bill Clinton\u2019s\u00a0counsel\u00a0during the turbulent years of the Whitewater investigation. The\u00a0powerbroker and top lobbyist\u00a0in more recent years\u00a0used his experience and know-how to represent family members of those killed in the September\u00a011, 2001,\u00a0attacks in lawsuits alleging Saudi Arabia\u2019s culpability. But the man I had the privilege of knowing was so much more. Outside of all that, I knew him\u00a0as a\u00a0friend; a husband\u00a0who\u00a0loved my dear friend Susanna, his wife of 17 years, with all of his heart; and a father who adored his eight children and 12 grandchildren. John Michael Quinn - \u201cJack\u201d - was the kind of person who would send a text of encouragement out of the blue, greet you with his giant smile and\u00a0a\u00a0twinkle in his eye no matter how he was feeling and\u00a0was\u00a0always eager to show love and affection to his large family and friends. Looking back\u00a0today\u00a0at my texts\u00a0from Jack, it\u00a0was\u00a0not uncommon to see \u201cI love you\u201d from him in the thread. But he was also someone who showed extreme kindness to people he barely knew. Jack was a CNN\u00a0legal analyst\u00a0for several years during the Trump administration, sharing his insights and vast expertise with our viewers on a regular basis. Elie Honig, now a senior CNN legal analyst, told me that he remembers being very new to television and meeting Jack in the green room. \u201cI,\u00a0of course,\u00a0knew who Jack was, but he\u2019d have no reason to know me aside from my first handful of on-air appearances. I hadn\u2019t even met him in person\u00a0yet,\u00a0and he went to the effort of getting my email address and sending me a note welcoming me and saying I was doing a great job. I\u2019ll always remember that gesture,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0told me, while noting that Jack was always \u201csunny\u201d even when his health issues became more challenging. Those health issues, a lung disease that eventually took his life, made his CNN appearances harder and harder. But his impact is indelible. One of our talented makeup artists remarked to me when learning of Jack\u2019s passing how kind and solicitous he always was - no matter the time or the circumstance, which is not always the case in the stressful and unpredictable world of cable news. Jack\u2019s\u00a0youngest son, Storm, and my son are about a year apart and became friends as babies. Watching Jack interact with his miracle boy was something to behold \u2013 the amount of love knew no bounds \u2013 nevermind that his DNA is so strong that Storm, much like Jack\u2019s other children, resembles him so much that it was almost eerie. The mark that Jack made on this world is far greater than his titles, far deeper than his jobs and far more impressive than his political influence. He was a man of character, compassion and good humor, and I am one of countless people who feel blessed to have had him in my life. May his memory be a blessing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/jack-quinn-died-white-house-counsel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_hunter-biden-gun-charge", "text": "Hunter Biden\u2019s latest attempts to throw out his federal gun case were rejected in back-to-back rulings Thursday, teeing up a high-stakes criminal trial next month in Delaware. The president\u2019s son had asked the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the charges by overturning\u00a0prior decisions\u00a0from the trial judge that let the case move forward. But the appellate panel instead rejected Hunter Biden\u2019s appeals, which related to his defunct plea deal and his claims that the case was tainted by political bias. Hours later, the trial judge, Maryellen Noreika, rejected Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0remaining\u00a0motion\u00a0to dismiss the case based on Second Amendment grounds. The rulings pave the way for the first-ever trial against the\u00a0child\u00a0of a sitting US president. They\u2019re also a victory for special counsel David Weiss,\u00a0who is prosecuting Hunter Biden in two separate criminal cases and is fending off aggressive pushback from his lawyers. With the gun case intact, Hunter Biden now faces a legally and politically perilous summer, with back-to-back trials while his father focuses on the 2024 campaign.\u00a0The gun trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. A separate tax trial is scheduled to begin in late June. \u201cIn reviewing the panel\u2019s decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\u201d Biden\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement about the appeals court ruling, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal. Prosecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which\u00a0violated federal law\u00a0because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts. His attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that \u201cpossessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.\u201d Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month. She also previously presided over Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0botched plea deal hearing\u00a0last summer. Hunter Biden is also facing a\u00a0federal tax indictment, and that trial is slated to begin in late June in California. He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals. Appeals court loss Weiss\u2019 team successfully argued that the appellate court didn\u2019t have jurisdiction to review whether Noreika made any mistakes earlier this year while rejecting Hunter Biden\u2019s motions to dismiss the\u00a0gun case. \u201cThis appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court\u2019s orders are appealable before final judgment,\u201d the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling. They turned away his attempts to review lower-court decisions about the legality of Weiss\u2019 appointment and whether last year\u2019s botched plea deal \u2013 which would\u2019ve resolved the case \u2013 was still active. In rejecting his appeal Thursday, the 3rd Circuit panel said those types of deals with prosecutors \u201cdo not implicate a right not to be tried\u201d and wouldn\u2019t give Hunter Biden additional avenues to pursue appeals. The decision was unanimous and based on procedural grounds. The three-judge panel included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, including Judge Cindy Chung, who was put on the bench by President Joe Biden. Further, the ruling could make it harder for Hunter Biden to appeal his loss in the Second Amendment challenge, which Noreika rejected Thursday. Second Amendment challenge Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys argued the three gun charges should be tossed out because the firearm-possession statute used against him violated the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. \u00a0The specific statutes involved in the case make it a crime to lie on federal firearm forms about using illicit drugs, and also make it illegal to own a gun while using those drugs. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys, citing a\u00a0recent decision from the 5th Circuit\u00a0\u2013 which does not cover the state of Delaware, where he was charged \u2013 argued that under the Second Amendment, an individual \u201ccan no longer be denied gun ownership due simply to past drug use.\u201d\u00a0But the trial judge disagreed in her ruling Thursday. \u201cThe current state of the law on the facial constitutionality of (the statute) is decidedly not in Defendant\u2019s favor,\u201d Noreika wrote. \u201cNo appellate court has agreed with his position, and possibly only one district court has found (the statute) unconstitutional on its face. This Court ultimately sides with the great majority of cases upholding the facial constitutionality of (the statute).\u201d In the 5th Circuit case, US v. Daniels, the conservative-leaning appeals court said the federal gun law that prohibits users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms was unconstitutional. In reaching that conclusion, the appeals court cited a landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision that\u00a0changes the framework that lower courts must use\u00a0when analyzing gun restrictions. Prosecutors handling Hunter Biden\u2019s case have called the 5th Circuit decision \u201cmistaken.\u201d They also noted Hunter Biden\u2019s own admission to using illicit drugs while he allegedly purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018. Discovery dispute Noreika on Thursday also rejected an attempt by Hunter Biden to obtain internal Justice Department documents that could shed light on any attempts by former President Donald Trump and his appointees to interfere with the long-running criminal investigation. As part of an effort to find evidence that Hunter Biden was being politically targeted,\u00a0his attorneys asked for any documents about him that involved Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr, other top Justice Department officials or several US attorneys. But the judge turned down that request Thursday. She\u00a0previously rebuffed\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s bid to throw out the case because of the supposed politicization, noting that even though Trump did call for Hunter Biden\u2019s prosecution while he was president, the charges were filed under President Joe Biden\u2019s watch and with oversight from Biden\u2019s appointees. \u201cDefendant has failed to show how any of the requested communications among former DOJ and Executive Branch officials could constitute exculpatory evidence as applied to him and the three firearm-related offenses being pursued here,\u201d Noreika wrote Thursday. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.

The officials\u00a0said there will be a lag time between the approval\u00a0of\u00a0the funds and\u00a0the\u00a0arrival\u00a0of the majority of the assistance that will make a significant difference on\u00a0the frontlines, a delay which they believe Russia will seek to exploit. Overnight\u00a0on Wednesday, Russia unleashed a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities say Russia fired more than 50 missiles and 20 drones, targeting energy infrastructure around the country. Ukraine\u2019s largest power company said this was the fifth time Russia has attacked its facilities in the last six weeks. \u201cThey are trying to cause as many suffering to Ukrainian people as possible now in order to take advantage of and destroy Ukrainian moral,\u201d Ukrainian parliament member Oleksiy Goncharenko told\u00a0CNN\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday. The months-long delay in approval\u00a0of\u00a0the funding\u00a0was resolved last month when Republican Speaker Mike Johnson defied opposition from the right of his party to bring a major security package that paired Ukraine funding with aid for Israel and Taiwan up for a vote. But months of inaction has resulted in real costs for Ukrainian forces on the battlefield in both territory and casualties, these\u00a0officials say. Russian forces are expected to attempt to make further progress and consolidate earlier gains, before this window of opportunity closes. Western and Ukrainian\u00a0officials view the near-term threat\u00a0of\u00a0stepped-up attacks as tied to Russian plans for a larger\u00a0offensive early this summer. US and Ukrainian\u00a0officials remain concerned about a further partial mobilization by Russia to send more manpower to the frontlines, as Ukraine is struggling with its own manpower shortage. As for Ukrainian prospects during the coming weeks, even with the arrival\u00a0of\u00a0new assistance, one US military\u00a0official told CNN, \u201cIt is hold the line at best.\u201d \u201cWith the level of supply, it will be very hard for us\u00a0to regain in any territory,\u201d Goncharenko agreed. \u201cSo it\u2019s more about stabilizing. It\u2019s more about winning the time, but not winning the war. So we need more support and we hope, or other countries will follow the\u00a0US\u00a0example.\u201d CNN reported recently that Russian forces have used an \u201cartillery drought\u201d plaguing Ukrainian forces to push forward\u00a0on the\u00a0eastern front near Avdiivka,\u00a0carrying out the largest Russian advance since the early months of the war.\u00a0Moscow\u2019s progress has\u00a0prompted warnings from\u00a0senior Ukrainian military officials\u00a0of\u00a0a possible\u00a0threat to Kyiv\u2019s supply lines and hubs in the east, which are now perilously close to being in range of superior Russian firepower. In recent weeks, Russia has thrown vast resources at weak Ukrainian defenses across the\u00a0eastern frontlines, pushing\u00a0toward\u00a0three key points: the vital military hub of Pokrovsk, west of Avdiivka;\u00a0the strategic heights of Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut; and Kurakhove in the southeast.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/russia-window-of-opportunity-ukraine-war/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_04_politics_access-hollywood-trump-what-matters", "text": "Being elected president shortly after surviving the publication of the leaked \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in 2016 is the moment in which Donald Trump defied political gravity. A politician was heard on tape saying truly disgusting things about women and yet was still elevated by voters to the highest office. Trump\u2019s ability to survive that embarrassing episode echoes in his reascendance to the Republican presidential nomination for a third time, despite losing the 2020 election and then trying to overturn the results. It\u2019s easy to forget how dumbfounding it was to hear Trump on that tape for the first time and how many Republicans who called on him to drop out of the presidential race back then now support him. If the embarrassing tape somehow represents Trump\u2019s greatest triumph, it is also something that continues to haunt him, as it became the focus of his hush money criminal trial in New York on Friday. RELATED: Read more about the testimony of former Trump aide Hope Hicks. The \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape reexamined Trump\u2019s 2016 victory in the Electoral College seems only more improbable in the retelling. Hicks, his former close aide, told jurors about what must have been the unbelievably awkward moment she read a transcript of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape \u2013 in which he brags about being able to grope women \u2013 to her boss. \u201cThis was a crisis,\u201d she said of its release\u2019s impact on the campaign. It\u2019s sordid stuff, and the outlines were generally known even without Hicks\u2019 testimony on Friday. The judge in the case ruled at the start of the trial that the tape itself can\u2019t be played in court, but it has been described. It is worth revisiting the earthquake the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape set off in the 2016 campaign. When the video came out, it left many people speechless. The tape was recorded in 2005, and it was leaked to The Washington Post, which published the video on October 7, 2016, a little more than a month before Election Day. Trump is heard talking about trying, unsuccessfully, to \u201cmove on\u201d an unnamed, married woman, and then crassly talks about his uncontrollable desire to kiss an actress he is about to meet with then-\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Billy Bush. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d he told Bush. \u201cYou can do anything. Grab \u2018em by the p****.\u201d Here\u2019s a video CNN published at the time: The fallout was immediate Multiple Republicans who today are completely behind Trump, like Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, called on him in 2016 to immediately step down. The perception inside Trump\u2019s inner circle was that most Republican lawmakers wanted him off the ticket, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie later wrote in a memoir. Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was \u201csickened.\u201d And then-Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus thought Trump should either resign or would lose in a landslide, according to Christie and then-Trump aide Steve Bannon. Even Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, who rarely issues public statements, expressed her disgust with the words on the tape, although she would later write it off as \u201cboy talk.\u201d Trump actually apologized Things were so grim back then that Trump issued what is probably the only apology of his political career in a straight-to-camera video posted on Twitter, now X, in which he admits the tape is real and takes responsibility. \u201cI said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,\u201d Trump said, although he made it clear he would not leave the race. Being exposed to people on the campaign trail had changed him, Trump said, before trying to draw an equivalence between his words and allegations against former President Bill Clinton. I\u2019ve written before about how rare it is to hear such a thing from Trump. It was not the only surprise in 2016 Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in 2016, Hillary Clinton, faced her own unwanted surprises, the most important of which was former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement that July that she was \u201ccareless\u201d in handling classified data on email. Worse for Clinton, on October 28 of that year, a little more than a week before Election Day, Comey told Congress the FBI was reviewing emails related to Clinton\u2019s personal server found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, a disgraced former congressman married to her top aide. Clinton would go on to get the vote of a larger number of people, but Trump, surprising even himself, would get the White House. Return of the tape Now, the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape is back. A key to prosecutors\u2019 case against Trump is their allegation that he and his former fixer Michael Cohen agreed to pay off adult-film star Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump had to tamp down on any allegations of impropriety, such as having an alleged affair with a porn star not long after his wife gave birth. That led to the hush money Cohen paid to Daniels. Cohen served time in federal prison for violating campaign finance law with the payments. The crime Trump is accused of is falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Cohen after the election. How the tape has aged Trump has since questioned whether it was his voice on the tape, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin reported for The New York Times in 2017. More recently, Trump was asked in May 2023 about the tape by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. He tried to parse the words in the tape. \u201cI said, \u2018women let you,\u2019\u201d he told Collins. \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018grab,\u2019\u201d he said, misquoting the tape. A moment that tested loyalty Bannon would later tell former CBS journalist Charlie Rose that the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d moment was important because it separated Republicans into those who would be loyal to Trump versus those who were part of the mainstream. Christie lost out on a Cabinet position in Trump\u2019s administration due to his revulsion of the tape, Bannon told Rose. In the years since, loyalty to Trump has become an increasingly important marker among Republicans as Trump beat back a deep field of presidential primary challengers. Perceived loyalty to Trump could become a de facto requirement for many federal workers if he wins in 2024 and carries through with a plan to reclassify a large portion of the federal bureaucracy as political appointees, according a recent report by CNN\u2019s investigative team. Still haunting Trump If the tape is evidence of Trump\u2019s ability to defy political gravity, it has also contributed to his humbling in other areas. A deposition in which he was asked about the tape was played for jurors who later found him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, a former magazine columnist, in a New York department store in the 1990s. Juries ordered Trump to pay more than $80 million for defaming her, although he has appealed those decisions.

{"id": "2024_05_07_politics_trump-stormy-daniels-analysis", "text": "\u201cThe People Call Stormy Daniels.\u201d It was the moment that Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial \u2014 bogged down in recent days in dreary testimony about accounting \u2014 roared back to life on Tuesday. A former president \u2014 who could find himself back behind the Oval Office desk in January \u2014 came face-to-face for the first time in years with the adult film star whom he\u2019s accused of silencing with a hush money payment. What came next was tawdry, compelling, and achingly embarrassing to Trump, who was forced to sit scowling as Daniels painted a detailed scene of a black-tiled hotel suite that allegedly hosted a liaison that the ex-president still denies. It was the latest unfathomable lurch of an election campaign like no other. And for a normal candidate who lacked Trump\u2019s Teflon political hide, it would probably be the end of the road. But as so often happens, one devastating legal blow to the ex-president was followed by a silver lining. He learned late Tuesday afternoon that Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed, indefinitely postponed a trial in his classified documents case in Florida. This means Trump almost certainly won\u2019t face a jury on federal charges of mishandling classified information before the election \u2014 a reality that prompted his former White House counsel Ty Cobb to accuse Cannon of slow walking the case, indulging frivolous motions and misunderstanding applicable law. \u201cThis is a case of bias and incompetence,\u201d Cobb told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. Cannon\u2019s move comes with Trump\u2019s two election interference cases, both of which have become swamped by his pre-trial delaying tactics and fulsome appeals, also unlikely to go on trial before voters make their fateful choice in November. The Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it will consider an effort by Trump and his co-defendants to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis from the 2020 election subversion case \u2013 another sign that pre-trial efforts to delay a trial are succeeding. So, while the hush money case is widely regarded as the weakest of the bunch facing Trump, it\u2019s likely the only one that could create the never-before-seen scenario of a convicted felon asking voters to elect him president. That made the testimony of Daniels even more critical. And the most important question after her first bruising three-and-three-quarters hours on the stand is whether her salaciousness testimony made a guilty verdict more likely \u2014 or ended up undermining the case. Furthermore, will the risqu\u00e9 nature of her description of her relationship with Trump break through in a way that previous unflattering revelations of the ex-president\u2019s character have failed to do and shift any critical swing state votes in November? Daniels reveals new details about alleged liaison with Trump nearly two decades ago Daniels, along with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, is one of two star witnesses in the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president. She told the jury Tuesday about a $130,000 hush money payment she received from Cohen before the 2016 election. Such payments are not illegal. But prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide it and to mislead voters in an early bout of election interference. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty. \u201cStormy gave new information about her brief liaison with Donald Trump and additional information about many of the key elements in the case,\u201d legal analyst Norm Eisen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cIt was one of the biggest days yet in this very eventful trial.\u201d The drama was even greater than it first appeared. A transcript of the day\u2019s proceedings revealed an exchange between Judge Juan Merchan and Trump\u2019s attorney that had not been audible in court. The judge complained that the ex-president was \u201ccursing audibly\u201d during Daniels\u2019 testimony and was shaking his head. \u201cIt has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that.\u201d The judge told the lawyer, Todd Blanche, that he spoke to him at the bench to avoid embarrassing the defendant but that the behavior needed to stop. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb, who was in court, reported that Trump was more engaged on Tuesday than at any previous moment in the trial. Trump was already on thin ice with the judge a day after Merchan warned he could face jail if he continued violating a gag order intended to protect jurors and witnesses. He did manage to avoid crossing the line while speaking to reporters in a courtroom corridor at the end of the day. But the blush-inducing testimony from Daniels may provide the most arduous test yet of his shaky self-discipline and bring the possibility of a new gag order showdown with Merchan closer. It\u2019s impossible to know how jurors will interpret individual chapters of a trial. But with the level of detail that Daniels provided about her time with Trump, including his \u201csilk or satin\u201d pajamas, she appeared to seriously undermine his denials that they had a relationship. That could be critical to explaining to jurors why Trump was so keen to allegedly cover it up. But Trump\u2019s attorney Susan Necheles was able to get Daniels to admit her antipathy for Trump and that she wanted to see him held to account. This admission could potentially cast doubt on her motives. It only takes one juror to thwart a conviction. And in an aggressive cross-examination that will resume on Thursday, Necheles sought to create reasonable doubt and to disqualify Daniels as a believable witness. \u201cAm I correct that you hate President Trump?\u201d Necheles asked. Daniels replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The former adult film star was then asked if she wanted the former president to go to jail. \u201cI want him to be held accountable,\u201d she replied. A surreal day of testimony As Trump tries to win back the White House in November, weighed down by four criminal indictments, an adverse civil fraud trial judgment worth half a billion dollars, the stigma of two impeachments and the memory of his assault on democracy after the 2020 election, the alleged facts of the case as aired on Tuesday felt well short of the hammer blows of history. For one thing, it all happened so long ago. The episode in question dates back to 2006 when Trump and Daniels were together in a hotel room at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe when the future president was in the early flush of his success as a reality star. Daniels said that after returning from the bathroom she was shocked to see Trump on the bed in a T-shirt and boxers. She testified she took off her clothes and they had sex in the missionary position. \u201cI was staring at the ceiling. I didn\u2019t know how I got there,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cI had on tiny little \u2026 strappy gold heels with little tiny buckles. My hands were shaking so hard. I was having a hard time getting dressed. He said, \u2018Oh, great. Let\u2019s get together again honey bunch. We were great together.\u2019 I just wanted to leave.\u201d Neither Trump nor Daniels could ever have envisioned nearly two decades ago the improbable path that they would both take \u2014 to the moment when the alleged bedroom secrets of a once-and-possibly future president would transfix a courtroom in the middle of the 2020s. While the span of the alleged interactions between Trump and Daniels \u2014 and later attempts to cover them up \u2014 are not necessarily important to how the case is decided, they could be more significant in public perceptions about the trial. This appeared to occur to Trump\u2019s second son, Eric Trump, who was in court Tuesday and posted on X, trying out a new Trump campaign attack line. \u201cPerspective: Sitting front row attempting to figure out how any of this garbage from 20 years ago relates to \u2018legal\u2019 bills submitted by a long time personal attorney being booked as a \u2018legal\u2019 expense,\u201d he wrote. As always, Donald Trump tried to put his own spin on events. \u201cThis was a very big day. A very revealing day, as you see, their case is totally falling apart,\u201d Trump claimed after watching his attorney seek to dismantle Daniels\u2019 story piece by piece. \u201cThey have nothing on books and records.\u201d\u00a0The former president is likely wildly over optimistic on that point since Daniels is mostly important to prosecutors in establishing the backstory of why the alleged cover-up took place and she does not have first-hand knowledge about the alleged bookkeeping transgressions. Still, following Daniels\u2019 lurid account, the ex-president\u2019s team moved for a mistrial on the grounds that unnecessary detail about the liaison could prejudice the jury against their client. Merchan denied the request but did admit that some of the most explicit content was \u201cbest left unsaid.\u201d That is a sentiment with which many Americans might concur.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/politics/trump-stormy-daniels-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_takeaways-from-day-14-of-the-donald-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers continued their attack on the credibility of Stormy Daniels for several hours on Thursday, with defense attorney Susan Necheles\u00a0accusing the adult film star of making up the story of having sex with Trump to make money. Daniels pushed back on claims she was untruthful about her sexual encounter with Trump, saying that the story was true, even as she was confronted with inconsistencies in some of the small details of her account. \u201cIf that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better,\u201d Daniels said of her encounter with Trump. One of Trump\u2019s former White House aides later took the stand, testifying about the comings and goings in the West Wing and breaking down in tears about how she lost her job and her book that was highly positive toward the former president. At the end of the day, the proceedings heated back up as Trump\u2019s attorneys argued, out of the presence of the jury, for a mistrial and to lift Trump from the gag order from speaking about Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan denied both motions. Here are the takeaways from Day 14 of the Trump hush money trial: Another day of contentious Stormy Daniels testimony Daniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair. Trump\u2019s attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter. She noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies \u2013 questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt \u201cwas so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?\u201d \u201cIf I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn\u2019t expecting to see there, yeah,\u201d Daniels responded. Necheles also asked how she described the encounter, pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her \u201ccome here\u201d and they started kissing on the bed. He did say \u201ccome here,\u201d Daniels said in response. \u201cYou made all this up, right?\u201d Necheles said. \u201cNo,\u201d Daniels responded. Necheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels\u2019 work as a writer of adult films. \u201cYou have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,\u201d Necheles asked. Wow,\u201d Daniels said with a pause. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.\u201d Prosecutors, defense spar over Daniels\u2019 financial situation Beyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation. Necheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she\u2019d earned $1 million and others where she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted. \u201cYou\u2019re celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,\u201d Necheles asked. \u201cNot unlike Mr. Trump,\u201d Daniels responded. Trump\u2019s attorney also questioned Daniels about her \u201cMake America Horny Again\u201d strip club tour in 2018 \u2013 showing posters she had promoted \u2013 and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book. During re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers\u2019 fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost. \u201cOn balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?\u201d \u201cNegative,\u201d Daniels said. Former Trump aide describes inner White House operations Former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump\u2019s West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office. Westerhout \u00a0was asked about a list of Trump\u2019s contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff \u2013 a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady. Eventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump\u2019s work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, \u201cliked speaking to people in person or on the phone.\u201d Asked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn\u2019t cite a specific number. \u201cA lot,\u201d Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and \u201clate into the night\u201d after she had gone to bed, she testified. The prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York. Westerhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution\u2019s narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017. When asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn\u2019t have and that she was \u201cvery regretful of my youthful indiscretion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve grown a lot since then,\u201d she said as she started crying. She was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, \u201cOff the Record.\u201d Westerhout said she \u201cthought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump forgave you, right?\u201d Necheles asked. \u201cHe did,\u201d\u202fWesterhout\u202fsaid. \u201cHe was a really good boss.\u201d Westerhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels\u2019 account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, \u201cMadeline, it\u2019s past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t get carve-out from gag order Trump\u2019s lawyers asked Merchan both to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against him after Daniels was off the stand. The judge rejected both requests. Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked for Trump to be allowed to publicly defend himself against Daniels\u2019 allegations, arguing the former president currently is forced to stay silent in response to the suggestion that there was a non-consensual sexual encounter between her and Trump. Blanche argued that Daniels has changed her story by suggesting that this \u201ccompletely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual.\u201d Yet, Blanche said, \u201che is not allowed to say \u2018I did not do that\u2019\u201d for voters who are seeing media coverage of the testimony. Merchan denied the request, saying he must protect the integrity of the proceedings and he doesn\u2019t trust Trump not to violate an order if he were to modify it. \u201cThe reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks, the vitriol,\u201d Merchan said. \u201cThese were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses.\u201d \u201cYour client\u2019s track record speaks for itself here \u2013 I can\u2019t take your word for it\u201d that Trump will stick to disputing the facts, the judge also said. Merchan denies another mistrial motion Merchan also denied Trump\u2019s renewed motion for a mistrial over the salacious testimony Daniels gave that his attorneys say unfairly prejudices the jury against Trump. The judge said Trump\u2019s outright denial of the incident and his legal team\u2019s attack on her credibility opened the door for prosecutors to bring in Daniels\u2019 testimony that turned salacious. \u201cThe more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels\u2019 story,\u201d Merchan said. Merchan pointed the finger at Necheles who opted not to object to several salacious lines of questioning that the defense later used as reasons the judge should declare a mistrial. Blanche argued that Daniels\u2019 testimony at trial was a new version of the alleged events \u2013 a point Merchan disagreed with. Prosecutor Josh Steinglass said Trump was aware of the \u201cmessy details\u201d of the encounter in 2016 and that shows motive for the hush money payment and cover up. Blanche argued that the level of detail prosecutors elicited from Daniels went too far.

For the second time this week, Merchan expressed surprise that Trump\u2019s lawyers had not objected more when Daniels was on the stand. And for the second time this week, Merchan rejected their motion for a mistrial. Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued Daniels\u2019\u00a0changed her story by suggesting that this \u201ccompletely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual\u201d and said the defense did not know those questions were coming, hearing them for the first time on Tuesday. The judge responded to their arguments saying, \u201cFor some unexplained reason that I still don\u2019t understand\u201d there was no objection to certain testimony cited in the motion for a mistrial and again today. Merchan specifically pointed to Daniels\u2019 testimony about the trailer park,\u00a0in which Daniels suggested Trump told her she would be stuck living in a trailer park before they had sex in 2006. The judge said he felt that was unnecessary and he objected himself. Another example listed by Merchan was the testimony about Trump not wearing a condom.\u00a0Merchan said he was surprised attorney Susan Necheles did not object. \u201cWhy on earth she (Necheles) wouldn\u2019t object to the mention of a condom I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Merchan said. Daniels testified on Tuesday that Trump did not wear a condom when they had sex and described telling Trump during their conversation at the hotel dining room table her sexual partners during filming of her movies always wore a condom. Merchan also referred back to the defense\u2019s opening statement when Blanche denied there was ever a sexual encounter between Daniels and Trump. The judge said that assertion opened the door for the prosecution to make an effort to show her story was credible to prove their case, allowing them to ask more detailed questions about the encounter. \u201cThe more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels\u2019 story,\u201d Merchan said.

{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_running-mate-trump-election-what-matters", "text": "It\u2019s easy to compare former President Donald Trump\u2019s search for a running mate to his old TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d in which would-be businesspeople contestants hoped to hear him say, \u201cYou\u2019re hired!\u201d But considering how the winner of Trump\u2019s last vice presidential search ultimately had to flee the Capitol when a mob of angry Trump supporters roamed the halls with chants of \u201cHang Mike Pence,\u201d the reality show construction feels very off. Throw in the gory side story of how one potential VP pick, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, may be out of the running due to her description in a forthcoming memoir of shooting her unruly dog and a \u201cdemon\u201d goat, and this year\u2019s running mate search is off to a strange start. Who is Trump considering? Trump seems to be enjoying the veepstakes as a weekend diversion from his ongoing criminal trial in New York. He called potential running mates onstage with him at a high-dollar joint fundraiser for his campaign and the Republican National Committee at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday. On Sunday, a number of rumored contestants conducted a series of media interviews from Florida, including House\u00a0GOP\u00a0Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum,\u00a0South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Burgum and Scott, who failed to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination with their own lackluster presidential campaigns this year, each moved adjacent to election denialism as they joined other supplicants in saying things that might impress Trump. Burgum told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that CNN disputed the 2016 election \u2013 which is a complete falsehood. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s 2016 election map. Trump won that election. During his presidential campaign, Burgum said he wanted to push for new ideas, but during the Tapper interview, he was pushing old, unproven conspiracy theories about mail-in voting. Separately, there was an awkward moment on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d when Scott repeatedly refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election regardless of who wins. Election skepticism is new for Scott, who did not dispute the outcome of the 2020 election. Rubio was asked on Fox News if he would leave his home state, where he is a senator, to satisfy a quirk of the 12th Amendment that prohibits presidential electors from voting for both a president and vice president from their state. Rubio did not say no. Rubio has turned hard from warning against Trump in 2016 and referring to the future president as a \u201ccon artist\u201d when both men were running for the Republican nomination to being a Trump supporter. Read more about the weekend audition from CNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Greg Clary. What does Trump want in a running mate? CNN has\u00a0reported that Noem is off the shortlist and not currently under consideration, something she addressed Monday. \u201cI think that the media has turned on me. And I understand that. I think that that\u2019s the part of being honest and being genuine,\u201d Noem said on \u201cCBS Mornings.\u201d \u201cThe American people want somebody who\u2019s real and doesn\u2019t pretend to be something that they\u2019re not. I\u2019ve never once said that I\u2019m perfect.\u201d Trump, who will ultimately choose his running mate, seems to prize loyalty over everything else. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio is another potential running mate. His metamorphosis from Trump-opposing pundit in 2016 to Trump-backer in 2024 was apparent during an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins last week, when she asked him if the way Trump treated Pence gives Vance any pause about wanting to be vice president. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger,\u201d Vance said. Pence has said otherwise and is clearly not in the running to be on Trump\u2019s ticket this time. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has yet to endorse Trump, is also not in the mix, according to CNN\u2019s reporting. How did Trump pick last time? In 2016, CNN reported that Trump was actually leaning toward picking former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had run for president that year. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was also on a three-person shortlist. Trump was swayed by advisers to pick Pence, a more conservative choice at the time. Pence spent the next four years as a loyal lieutenant before standing up to Trump and refusing to help overturn the 2020 election results. The Christie pick might have aged even worse than Pence; while both men ran against Trump in the primary this cycle, Christie has been a committed Trump opponent since the fallout of January 6, 2021, and framed his campaign as an effort to stop Trump. Looking back at other presidential campaigns, there are multiple examples of regretful picks. The late Sen. John McCain of Arizona regretted his last-minute decision to pick then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in 2008. She shook up the campaign, as desired, but also committed multiple gaffes. The most famous running mate fiasco may be the selection of Sen. Thomas Eagleton to be George McGovern\u2019s Democratic running mate in 1972. Eagleton did not disclose his multiple hospitalizations for mental health problems to McGovern\u2019s campaign. Eagleton ultimately withdrew from the race and Democrats hastily opted for Sargent Shriver. McGovern lost in a landslide to then-President Richard Nixon and his vice president, Spiro Agnew. They won reelection, but Agnew may go down as among the worst vice presidents since he was forced to resign when the Department of Justice accused him of taking bribes, including during his time as vice president. Running mates in recent campaigns often go through an intense vetting process. When will Trump make a decision? Recent history suggests Trump\u2019s running mate will be picked over the summer, close to the Republican National Convention that will be held in Milwaukee from July 15 to 18. Trump picked Pence on July 15 in 2016, announcing the decision in a tweet. Hillary Clinton announced her selection of Sen. Tim Kaine a week later, also by tweet, on July 22. Joe Biden announced his selection of Kamala Harris in an August 11, 2020, email to supporters. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate in 2012, announced his pick of then-Rep. Paul Ryan from Wisconsin on August 11. In 2008, the picks came later. Barack Obama announced Biden as his pick in a text message to supporters on August 23. The Republican nominee that year, McCain, announced his pick of Palin on August 29. These selections usually come a few days or a week before the party\u2019s national convention, but there are instances, such as Democrats in 2004 and Republicans in 2012, when the pick comes two weeks before the convention. Selecting a running mate would historically occur at the convention, although that has not happened since 1988, according to 538. What about Biden and Harris? Although it is not unprecedented in US history for a president to change running mates, it hasn\u2019t happened in a good long while. Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president four times and had three vice presidents. The first, John Nance Garner, left Roosevelt\u2019s ticket after two terms, frustrated with Roosevelt\u2019s attempt to change the makeup of the Supreme Court and refusal to pare back elements of the New Deal. He actually challenged Roosevelt in some primaries in 1940. Roosevelt\u2019s second vice president, Henry Wallace, was dropped by delegates at the convention in 1944 in favor of Harry Truman. All indications are that Biden plans to keep Harris, the first woman to be elected in a nationwide election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/running-mate-trump-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

FBI officials are concerned that the war in Ukraine \u2013\u00a0and President Joe Biden\u2019s reliable backing of Kyiv\u00a0\u2013 might be an \u201canimating event for the Russians,\u201d the FBI official said at a briefing with reporters about election security efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly\u2026 keeping our eye out to make sure that that\u2019s not increasing [their] risk taking.\u201d The FBI briefed reporters on the condition that the senior FBI officials not be named. A clear divide has emerged in US politics, with Democrats largely backing Biden\u2019s financial and military support for Ukraine, and some leading Republicans, including\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0and\u00a0congressional GOP hardliners, increasingly backing away from the foreign aid. US officials are concerned that,\u00a0with\u00a0US military aid to Ukraine\u00a0potentially on the line in the November election, Russia could be motivated to\u00a0more aggressively meddle in the 2024 election than it did in 2020.\u00a0But US officials have not publicly identified any examples of that happening yet. In the 2020 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to denigrate Biden, support Trump and undermine confidence in the US electoral process, according to a declassified\u00a0US intelligence report. But Russia\u2019s actions in 2020 weren\u2019t as brazen or far-reaching as its\u00a0hack-and-leak operations\u00a0to help Trump and undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy in 2016, according to US intelligence agencies. The FBI official\u2019s comments on Thursday echo those made by a senior National Security Agency official in March. \u201cI think where we diverge in this election cycle is Russia is very motivated to make sure that that the focus on support to Ukraine is disrupted,\u201d Rob Joyce, who headed NSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Directorate before retiring in late March, told reporters. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see the themes of their activities all pushed through a lens of what is going to erode support for Ukraine.\u201d Asked by CNN if that makes Russia more likely to interfere in the 2024 US elections compared to 2020, Joyce said: \u201cI don\u2019t know that it makes them more likely, but it does make them dangerous.\u201d During Thursday\u2019s FBI press briefing, a second senior FBI official said that Russia\u00a0likely views\u00a0US election infrastructure, including state and local government networks, as \u201clegitimate targets\u201d for cyber-espionage and data collection. \u201cRussia can use their access to those government networks to undermine confidence in the US election integrity and bolster influence operations,\u201d the second FBI official said. The FBI officials also singled out China and Iran as other governments that could be willing to interfere in or influence the 2024 US election. In the 2020 election, China\u00a0considered\u00a0conducting influence operations aimed at changing the outcome of the election but chose not to, according to the\u00a0US intelligence report. Iran, meanwhile, conducted a \u201cmultipronged covert influence campaign\u201d aimed at hurting Trump\u2019s election bid, the report said. Artificial intelligence, the first FBI official said, increases the ability of sophisticated state actors \u201cto scale their operations and \u2026 really build them out larger than we\u2019ve seen previously.\u201d CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/fbi-concern-ukraine-russia-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "politics_trump-trial-election-calendar-dg", "text": "Donald Trump is juggling a busy court and campaign schedule as he defends himself in several criminal cases while also vying for a second term in the White House. The former president\u2019s criminal hush money trial began on April 15.

{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_biden-challenges-2024-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden wins a second term later this year, he will have defied one of the most complex political environments for a president seeking reelection in years. At home and abroad, he is facing the kind of headwinds that would normally cast severe doubt on his chances of convincing voters that they should send him back to the White House. Biden\u2019s difficult dynamic was on show in an exclusive interview with CNN this week, in the swing state of Wisconsin, which he only won by around 20,000 votes in 2020 and that could be decisive again in November. The president is facing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine that carry a constant threat of escalation and repeatedly throw up challenges to his credibility as a leader. At home, Biden is beset by campus protests triggered by the Israeli offensive in Gaza and a revolt by some progressive and young voters vital to his coalition. More broadly, the electorate isn\u2019t yet buying his \u201cmorning in America\u201d vibe. They\u2019re suffering from high prices and interest rates that confound his reassurances that the economy is in great shape and mask a strong legislative record that stands comparison with any recent president. Then there\u2019s the challenge of being the oldest president in history, running for a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden\u2019s saving grace, however, may be that Donald Trump \u2013 his opponent in a 2020 election rematch that Americans have repeatedly told pollsters they don\u2019t want \u2013 may be saddled with even more vulnerabilities than he is. Trump spent this week in a Manhattan court listening to embarrassing testimony about an alleged liaison he had with an adult film star in 2006 that is now at the center of a hush money trial. New York prosecutors claim he falsified business records to hide a payment to Stormy Daniels in an early act of election interference in 2016. He\u2019s denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump also has a habit of alienating the key suburban voters likely to decide which of the two one-term presidents wins a second mandate in November. His recent warnings that he couldn\u2019t rule out violence after the 2024 election, and his refusal to say he\u2019d accept the result, revived dark memories of his attempt to steal the 2020 election and underscored his fundamental threat to democracy. Trump\u2019s base voters have no problems either with his criminal trials or his false claims that he was cheated out of office. But the most recent midterm and presidential elections suggest that he does scare off large sectors of the general electorate. Trump has also talked himself into a difficult corner on abortion \u2013 one of the few issues where Biden outpolls him and which Democrats believe could enthuse their voters and produce the kind of turnout that could swamp the ex-president in November. Trump\u2019s role in building a generational conservative majority on the Supreme Court is coming back to haunt him after the justices overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. While Trump insists the issue must be left to the states, it\u2019s offering Democrats an opening every time a Republican legislature or conservative court delivers an extreme new anti-abortion measure or decision. Israel may be far from the biggest worry for Trump\u2019s campaign Polls consistently show that voters care most about the economy. And the president\u2019s ratings on the issue are underwater. A CNN poll in April showed that Biden had a 34% rating on the economy \u2014 and 29% on inflation \u2014 as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential elections. And voters who say the economy is very important to their vote backed Trump over Biden 62% to 30%. This deficit for the president comes despite three years of solid growth and job creation numbers. But inflation, a corrosive political force that can ruin political careers and that only voters who remember the early 1980s have experienced before, has bequeathed a period of high interest rates. This is proving punishing to home and car buyers, for instance. And many Americans still get a shock every time they go to the grocery store. In his interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, the president pushed back on the notion that the economy is in poor shape while expressing some understanding for the pain caused by high prices. But he was still defensive on the issue \u2014 recalling some previous presidents who appeared irked that voters weren\u2019t appreciating their efforts. Asked by Burnett when he would restore consumer confidence, Biden replied: \u201cWe have already turned it around,\u201d then added, \u201cThe polling data has been wrong all along. You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks you have to call to get one response? The idea that we\u2019re in a situation where things are so bad \u2026 we have created more jobs. We have made \u2013 we\u2019re in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs.\u201d Biden has also balked at Trump\u2019s efforts to conjure nostalgia for the economy in his first term \u2013 before jobs and growth went into free fall during a once-in-a-century pandemic. \u201cLet me say it this way, when I started this administration, people were saying there\u2019s going to be a collapse of the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again, in the world,\u201d the president said. But telling voters things are great when they don\u2019t feel they are is a questionable political strategy. Any time a president looks like he isn\u2019t fully in touch with the reality of voters\u2019 lives, he\u2019s on dangerous ground. In 1992, for instance, President George H.W. Bush was running for reelection. He was asked in a campaign debate, \u201cHow can you find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience of what is ailing them?\u201d Bush got off to a bad start by looking at his watch, making it look like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world. He then offered a halting and confusing answer that ended with: \u201cOf course you feel it when you are president of the United States and that is why I am trying to do something about it.\u201d His rival, Bill Clinton, then stood up and gave a national audience a taste of his burning \u201cfeel your pain\u201d political talent. He directly addressed the questioner, said that as Arkansas governor he knew by name many people who lost their jobs, and told the nation: \u201cThis decision better be about what kind of economic theory you want. Not just people saying I want to go fix it.\u201d A few months later, Clinton was in the White House. Biden has more time than Bush to convince voters that better economic times are ahead, and he\u2019d be considerably helped if the Federal Reserve begins to ease rates in the summer. He\u2019s been contrasting his own humble origins with Trump\u2019s billionaire lifestyle in recent weeks, trying to puncture the idea that the ex-president cares more about working Americans than he does, while warning his predecessor would destroy the Affordable Care Act if he gets back in the Oval Office. \u201cI look at it from a position \u2013 not being facetious \u2013 from a Scranton perspective,\u201d Biden told Burnett. \u201cHe looks at it from a Mar-a-Lago perspective. He wants to give more significant tax cuts to the super wealthy.\u201d And Biden is fortunate in that he faces a rival with his own massive liabilities, rather than a young rising star with a gift for coining a middle-class economic narrative like Clinton. Biden\u2019s path becomes even more complex But if anything, the president\u2019s path to reelection is becoming even more complicated.\u00a0He\u2019s now locked in a showdown with the prime minister of Israel \u2014 always a treacherous proposition for US leaders. This crisis risks playing into Trump\u2019s contention that the world and the nation is spinning out of control and needs a strongman to fix it. The fracture with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu occurred after the president warned in the CNN interview that he would halt the transfer of some weapons to Israel if it went ahead with a major offensive into the Gazan city of Rafah. Biden has been under enormous pressure from progressive activists, supporters on Capitol Hill and Arab American voters in the key swing state of Michigan to rein in Netanyahu after the deaths of many thousands of Palestinian civilians in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the October 7 terror attacks that killed 1,200 people. Campus protests have, meanwhile, caught Biden between young and progressive voters who are furious with his support for Israel in the war, and moderates who might be susceptible to his predecessor\u2019s chaos narrative. It\u2019s not clear that heated Republicans attacks on Biden over Israel Thursday will seriously wound him with his own voters. But the tone of the criticism bolstered a wider Republican narrative that Biden is weak and incapable of stabilizing an increasingly restless world. \u201cThat\u2019s a failure of leadership. That is cowardice, that is answering, trying to make a political calculus here that it helps him get out from underwater,\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said. The North Carolinian\u2019s colleague from Missouri, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, added: \u201cThis is the message to our allies that, you know, if it\u2019s politically inconvenient for the president to send you arms then, you know, sorry, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Biden has tried to insulate himself from the political impact of the protests with centrist voters by arguing that while the right to demonstrate is constitutionally guaranteed, any property damage from students occupying college buildings is unacceptable. And in a speech on Capitol Hill memorializing victims of the Holocaust earlier this week, he condemned examples of antisemitism reported at some of the protests. He warned that too many people were \u201cdenying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7.\u201d Still, polls show that the Israel-Hamas conflict is well down the list of issues that most concern voters \u2014 including the young voters most often cited as deserting Biden in droves over the conflict. But in an election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, the potential for defections or no shows from angry Democratic voters is an alarming one for the president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-challenges-2024-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Here are some key lines from the interview: \u25ba On polling data that shows him trailing Trump on the economy and whether he is running out of time to turn around perceptions of the economy before Election Day: Biden pointed to polling he said suggests a majority of people were satisfied with their own situation. \u201cThey think the nation\u2019s not in good shape, but they\u2019re personally in good shape,\u201d Biden said. White House advisers have previously pointed to a University of Michigan survey that has shown a general uptick in consumer sentiment. Regarding inflation, he agreed that people feel day-to-day pain in the increased price of groceries and other items they need, but he argued it is more about anger than being unable to afford things. \u201cThey have the money to spend. It angers them and it angers me that they have to spend more,\u201d he argued, before talking about \u201ccorporate greed\u201d being responsible. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released in late April, a majority of Americans, 70%, said economic conditions in the US were poor, and there was similarly dismal approval of Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. On the subject of personal finances, CNN\u2019s polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote: Americans\u2019 perceptions of their own finances also remain negative, with 53% saying they are dissatisfied with their personal financial situation while 47% are satisfied. Dissatisfaction is starkly prevalent among those with lower incomes (67% dissatisfied in households with annual incomes lower than $50,000), people of color (64% say they are dissatisfied) and younger Americans (61% of those younger than 45 say they are dissatisfied). \u25ba On why people should believe him on the economy rather than Trump: Biden was in Wisconsin to notch a win where a Trump plan failed. Trump, during his presidency, announced a deal to entice the Taiwanese company Foxconn to build up tech manufacturing jobs in the Midwest. That never came to be, and the Foxconn site in Racine, Wisconsin, was largely abandoned. Biden visited the area to announce a plan by Microsoft to build a data hub there to train workers on how best to use artificial intelligence. Biden\u2019s claim of 15 million jobs being created in the US during his administration is correct, but it lacks the context that so many jobs were temporarily lost during the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden later argued he was coming at the economy form \u201ca Scranton perspective\u201d while Trump was coming from \u201ca Mar-a-Lago perspective.\u201d \u25ba On how seriously he takes the threat that if Trump believes the election is not \u201chonest,\u201d the former president again won\u2019t accept the election results: \u201cThe guy is not a democrat with a small d,\u201d Biden said, suggesting Trump does not believe in democracy. He added that Trump, if reelected, has promised to use his attorney general to target certain people and to be his supporters\u2019 \u201cretribution.\u201d \u201cWhat president has ever said anything like this stuff?\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd he means it.\u201d Biden said the leaders of other democracies are rooting for him. \u201cEighty percent of them after we have a major meeting, they go, you have to win for my democracy to stick \u2013 their democracy to stick,\u201d Biden said. \u25ba On being called \u201cgenocide Joe\u201d at pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses and whether he hears the message of young Americans: But Biden expanded, suggesting protesters have gone too far: There is a legitimate right to free speech and protest. There\u2019s a legitimate right to do that and they have a right to do that. But there\u2019s not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There\u2019s not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people\u2019s access to class. That\u2019s against the law. From there, he tried to pivot to explaining that he has counseled Israel to develop better plans for what to do in Gaza, and he compared it with mistakes the US made after 9/11 when it invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cIt made sense to get (Osama) bin Laden; it made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq they had a nuclear weapon,\u201d Biden said. Those are both political sore spots for Biden, who pulled US troops from Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to reassert complete control of the country. He also voted in favor of invading Iraq as a US senator. \u25ba On whether US bombs have been used to kill civilians in Gaza: Biden said the US has delayed one shipment of powerful 2,000-pound bombs and that he has told Israelis he will not support their military\u2019s plan to conduct operations inside Rafah, in southern Gaza on the Egyptian border. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers,\u201d Biden said, although he promised the US would still help Israel protect itself from outside attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the Middle East recently,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/cnn-interview-joe-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_biden-migrants-ineligible-asylum", "text": "The Biden administration on Thursday proposed a rule that would allow immigration officials to rapidly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum, casting the new regulation as a measure to enhance border security. The proposed rule, which is narrow in scope, doesn\u2019t change asylum eligibility but would allow immigration officials to more quickly remove migrants who are ineligible for asylum earlier in the asylum process. \u201cThe proposed rule we have published today is yet another step in our ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of the American public by more quickly identifying and removing those individuals who present a security risk and have no legal basis to remain here,\u201d\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Thursday. The move comes as the White House has tried to toughen its position on the US-Mexico border and flip the script on Republicans who continue to hammer President Joe Biden on immigration ahead of the November election. Asylum officers, under the proposed rule, would be able to reject asylum claims within days of a migrant being encountered when there is evidence that they pose a national security or public safety risk. Under current procedures, that often happens later in the process. The department also announced Thursday that asylum officers would need to consider whether an asylum seeker could \u201creasonably relocate to another part of the country of feared persecution when assessing claims\u201d under revised guidance. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a series of measures to expand our use of executive authority and resources in order to address what we are seeing on our border and really, throughout the whole hemisphere,\u201d a senior Homeland Security official told reporters, citing congressional inaction. The rule, which will be published Monday, still needs to go through a public comment period before taking effect later this year, according to the senior DHS official. Politico first reported on the proposed changes. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut acknowledged ahead of the announcement that the administration was pursuing asylum changes, but noted that without legislation, making full scale changes to the asylum system is incredibly difficult. Murphy told reporters Wednesday he\u2019s been engaged with the administration on the policies under review, but noted fuller scale changes that Republicans want Biden to make risk being challenged in court. Senate Democrats are going to keep pushing for the failed bipartisan immigration bill to get more GOP support, Murphy said, adding that at this point, it\u2019s not clear the measure would get another vote.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_paul-whelan-american-soldier-russian-arrest", "text": "Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia, expressed renewed optimism about US efforts to secure his release in a call with CNN on Wednesday, but acknowledged \u201ca bit of a concern\u201d that the recent arrest of a US soldier in Russia could complicate matters. Whelan, who has been detained more than five years in Russia and is designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, said he was \u201cbroadly\u201d aware of the arrest after being informed by his parents but did not know any details. US Staff Sgt. Gordon Black traveled to Russia without permission from the US military to visit his girlfriend, his mother said. \u00a0He was arrested in the far-eastern city of Vladivostok last week on charges of theft. A court ordered him to remain in pre-trial detention until July 2. The US has not been granted consular access to see him. Whelan said that he had \u201ca bit of a concern\u201d that if Black were designated as wrongfully detained, it could set back negotiations for his own release and that of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The State Department has not yet made that determination in Black\u2019s case, and it is often a lengthy process. \u201cThis latest arrest will complicate my situation if that person is declared wrongfully detained,\u201d he told CNN, explaining that when Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner were arrested, \u201cthat complicated things.\u201d Reed and Griner were both designated as wrongfully detained by the State Department and later freed in prisoner swaps with Russia. US officials said that Russia refused to include Whelan in either of those swaps. \u201cUnfortunately, if this gentleman is declared wrongfully detained, it will sort of start negotiations for Evan and I all over again, because then there\u2019ll be the three of us. This is one of the problems that we\u2019ve had in the past. They were negotiating for me, and then it was Trevor and me, and then it was Brittney and me. And now it\u2019s Evan and me. And every time they\u2019ve negotiated, it\u2019s always been starting fresh when there\u2019s another person involved. So yeah, it is a bit of a concern,\u201d he explained. Still, Whelan sounded more positive about the US\u2019 efforts to secure his release than in his past conversations with CNN. In the call from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Wednesday, Whelan explained that in December, around the anniversary of his detention, \u201cI was pretty depressed.\u201d \u201cIt had been five years. Nothing seemed to be happening. Proposals made weren\u2019t honored by the Russians. The Russians didn\u2019t seem to make proposals of their own that made sense. And I was quite depressed that there hadn\u2019t been enough movement and that there hadn\u2019t been enough done. Since then, I\u2019ve had several phone calls and spoken to several high-level people who are assuring me that they\u2019re doing everything that they can do,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that there are ongoing negotiations, proposals have been made. It\u2019s a concern that it has gone on this long, but I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re near the end, that the light at the end of the tunnel isn\u2019t just another train coming at me, as I like to say,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has put forward several \u201csignificant\u201d proposals to the Russians for Whelan. One was presented and rejected in late November to try to bring home both Whelan and Gershkovich, who is also designated as wrongfully detained. US officials have consistently said that bringing home Whelan and Gershkovich is a top priority. \u201cPaul has shown tremendous resilience in the face of difficult circumstances,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday. \u201cRussia should release him immediately.\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Whelan in mid-February \u2013 at least the third time the top US diplomat has spoken by phone with the ex-Marine. The two also spoke in August 2023 and December 2022. \u201cI\u2019ve been reassured by the State Department that they\u2019ve got everyone working on this that they can and they\u2019re doing everything that they can to get this resolved. That said, you know, I\u2019ve made many requests to speak to the president, and I\u2019d like to speak to people in the top echelon to ensure that they realize what the situation is and that, you know, I am being held hostage. I haven\u2019t done anything. And I really need their help to resolve this,\u201d he explained.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/paul-whelan-american-soldier-russian-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_house-passes-extension-faa", "text": "The House voted on Wednesday to pass a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, a stopgap move intended to head off a looming end-of-week deadline. Congress is up against a Friday deadline of May 10 to reauthorize Federal Aviation Administration authorities. This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17. The Senate will next need to pass the extension now that it has passed the House. The move to pass a one-week patch comes as the Senate is working its way toward passage of a five-year FAA reauthorization bill. It had become unclear, however, if that bill could pass both chambers by Friday\u2019s deadline as senators push for a variety of amendments. The broader FAA reauthorization bill is expected to ultimately pass with widespread bipartisan support. But as debate continues over some of its provisions, any one senator could delay passage of the extension beyond the Friday night deadline as quick passage of legislation requires unanimous consent. Lawmakers announced a bipartisan agreement had been reached for the broader FAA reauthorization bill at the end of last month, but the legislation has touched off wide-ranging debate. One flashpoint has\u00a0centered around\u00a0flights at the DC-area Reagan National Airport \u2013 with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package currently being debated. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday ahead of the House move to pass the extension that the Senate is \u201cworking really hard\u201d to finish the broader FAA reauthorization. \u201cWe\u2019re working really hard to get in and finish,\u201d Schumer said during his weekly press conference, though the chamber has been at an impasse over which amendment votes to include. Republican Whip John Thune welcomed the House move to pass a one-week FAA reauthorization, but cautioned that there still has yet to be an agreement on how to move ahead quickly on the reauthorization in the United States Senate. \u201cIt just gives us a little breathing room,\u201d Thune said. \u201cI think the goal is to try to drive through and get a result out of the Senate yet this week, but at least now if necessary, it can be punted.\u201d The Biden administration said Wednesday that it \u201csupports enactment\u201d of the broader FAA reauthorization bill. \u201cReauthorizing the FAA is critical to enhancing aviation safety, improving the efficiency of the aviation system, strengthening passenger rights, and collaborating with international partners,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement Wednesday evening.

According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing more critical moments this week that will test his fraught relationship with his base over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and potentially widen the partisan split about the Jewish state that has been building for years. Long before the current conflict, polls showed that sympathies among rank-and-file Democrats have been shifting from Israel toward the Palestinians over roughly the past two decades\u00a0\u2014 a period that coincides with almost unbroken right-leaning governments in Israel, mostly led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Simultaneously, support for Israel over that same long period has markedly increased among rank-and-file Republican voters. As a result, over twice as many Republican as Democratic voters now say they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, a much bigger gap between the parties than earlier in this century, according to Gallup Organization polling. This widening partisan chasm in the United States suggests that whenever Netanyahu leaves the political stage in Israel, an inescapable part of his legacy will be a leading role in shattering the bipartisan consensus that for decades provided Israel an almost unassailable position in US politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the drivers of the US-Israeli relationship that have accounted for its resilience, its special quality and character over the years, are more under stress than at any point in my government experience or even out of government,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has advised six secretaries of state on the Mideast. That rising pressure could make Biden the last of his kind: Though the vast majority of Democratic office-holders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. He\u2019s expected to make a speech on antisemitism on Tuesday at an event sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Meanwhile, Democratic critics of his handling of the war will be watching on Wednesday when his administration is due to report to Congress on whether Israel is using US weapons in accordance with international law and is cooperating with the delivery of humanitarian aid. Biden\u2019s deep personal bond with Israel already makes him a throwback in US politics. In the first half century after Israel\u2019s formation in 1948, it was Democratic presidents such as Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton who displayed the greatest emotional connection to the Jewish state. Republican presidents including Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also supported Israel but more overtly qualified that support when it conflicted with their other regional goals of preserving access to oil and repelling Soviet influence; Reagan and Bush each at points protested Israeli actions they opposed by temporarily withholding aid. Over roughly the past quarter century this partisan pattern has inverted. Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump have identified most thoroughly with Israel, while Clinton (in his second term) and Barack Obama experienced the most disagreements with the Israeli government. Many factors have contributed to this reversal of roles. Bush\u2019s campaign against Islamic extremism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks encouraged him to place more value on Israel as a regional ally. Growing identification with Israel among US White evangelical Christians, a key GOP constituency, also nudged the party toward greater support for the Jewish state. Conversely, more voters in the Democratic coalition (both racial minorities and liberal Whites) came to see Israel\u2019s treatment of the occupied Palestinian territories as colonial, or even apartheid-type, oppression. While holding the prime minister position in the late 1990s and then again with only brief interruption since 2009, Netanyahu has also played a huge personal role in prompting this American partisan reversal. Netanyahu has pursued staunchly conservative policies within Israel (such as his attempt to weaken the judiciary that triggered massive nationwide protest) and rebuffed pressure from successive Democratic presidents to negotiate an independent Palestinian state. As important, he has aligned with the Republican Party as overtly as any foreign leader has with either political party in modern times. Netanyahu in 2015, for instance, delivered a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal at the invitation of House Republicans \u2014 over express objections from Obama. And Netanyahu recently echoed Republican talking points at a news conference when he dismissed the protests about the war on US campuses as simply widespread antisemitism. Against this backdrop, partisan polarization about Israel among American voters was already widening years before the brutal Hamas attack last October and the devastating Israeli response it triggered. One measure is the annual Gallup polls that ask Americans whether they sympathize mostly with Israel or mostly with the Palestinians. In 2001, the share of Republican voters who said they sympathized mostly with Israel exceeded the share of Democrats by only eight percentage points (59% vs. 51%.) By Obama\u2019s second term, Republican partisans were over 20 points more likely than Democrats to say they sympathized mostly with Israel. The gap between the parties in sympathy for Israel expanded under Trump to nearly 40 points, and it has soared to 45 points under Biden \u2014 nearly six times the difference in 2001. In the 2023 and 2024 surveys, Gallup recorded for the first time that the share of Democrats who sympathized mostly with the Palestinians exceeded the share who mostly favored Israel. Another long-running survey series from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found similar, though not quite as extensive, movement. In 2002, the share of Republicans who said the US should take Israel\u2019s side in the conflict was roughly double the percentage of Democrats; in the latest survey, \u00a0conducted this February, the gap had grown to about 3-to-1. The survey found that the share of Democrats who said the US should align with Israel in the conflict, after falling through the Trump years, rebounded to nearly 1-in-5 in the latest poll, almost exactly its level in the early 2000s. But as many Democrats now say the US should side with the Palestinians \u2013 a view held by just 1-in-50 Democrats in 2002. (That\u2019s also the same share of Republicans today\u00a0 who say the US should side with the Palestinians.) Most Democrats said the US should not take either side in the conflict \u2014 a view shared by only about two-fifths of Republicans. An array of polls this spring show how the war in Gaza has hardened this partisan split. \u00a0Earlier this year, both Quinnipiac University and CBS/YouGov polls found that while about 55% of Republicans wanted the US to send more military aid to Israel, about two-thirds of Democrats did not. Nearly half of Democrats, but only a little over one-fifth of Republicans in the CBS poll, said the US should pressure Israel to stop the fighting. While a slim majority of Republicans expressed confidence in Netanyahu in an April Pew survey, over 7-in-10 Democrats said they had little or no faith in the Israeli leader \u201dto do the right thing.\u201d In the Quinnipiac survey just 5% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu; the number was 11 times as high among Republicans. All of the dividing lines separating the parties are also cleaving the generations. Just 1-in-12 young adults in the Quinnipiac poll said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu and over two-thirds opposed sending more arms to Israel; likewise, in the Pew survey about two-thirds of young adults said they viewed the Israeli government unfavorably. Gallup\u2019s latest poll found that while older adults still mostly favor Israel, a plurality of younger adults now express sympathy for the Palestinians. These shifts in attitudes within the Democratic coalition have only modestly changed behavior among the party\u2019s leading elected officials. Only 37 House Democrats ultimately voted against the recently approved foreign aid package that included over $26 billion in new military assistance to Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite an earlier speech criticizing Netanyahu, is reportedly joining with House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint congressional session \u2014 an extraordinary opportunity given how many of Biden\u2019s requests Netanyahu has resisted since the war began. Liberal critics of Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians, both before and after the October 7 attacks, largely attribute the widening disconnect between Democratic voters and elected officials to the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other pro-Israeli lobbying groups in Washington. Since the Obama presidency, AIPAC has become more aggressive in supporting primary campaigns against Democratic officials critical of Israel; it has pledged to spend $100 million this year to defeat members of Congress who have criticized Israel\u2019s conduct of the war most strongly such as Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. \u201cAIPAC\u2019s enormous financial and political pressure in Washington is the most important factor in slowing down larger numbers of Democratic officials from opposing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, who has held senior positions in multiple liberal organizations and has been active in organizing opposition to the war. \u201cBy targeting Democrats who oppose a blank check of weapons funding to Israel, AIPAC aims to stall an inevitable generational shift within the party.\u201d Yet AIPAC\u2019s influence alone doesn\u2019t explain the distance opening between Democratic voters and officials. Part of the answer, as Shahid suggests, is generational. Biden personifies an older cohort of US political leaders whose image of Israel was formed when it was a lonely outpost of democracy and haven for Holocaust survivors. Ordinary Americans and US political leaders alike in the years of the 1967 and Yom Kippur (1973) wars tended to view Israel, in Miller\u2019s words, as a David barely fending off threatening Goliaths; now, many younger Democrats in particular believe \u201cIsrael is no longer David, it\u2019s Goliath,\u201d and it \u201cis pounding David\u201d in Gaza, Miller said. Older Democratic officials have been less influenced than younger ones by the emergence of that new perspective among their voters. Many observers also note that Biden tends to view foreign policy much as he does domestic politics \u2014 placing enormous confidence in his ability to leverage personal relationships with other leaders. \u201cBiden always says \u2018all foreign policy is an extension of personal relationships,\u2019\u201d said Ben Rhodes, who served as a senior National Security Council adviser while Biden served as Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I heard him say that.\u201d Biden over the course of the war has more explicitly criticized Netanyahu and the far-right coalition that he is governing with, but he has still rebuffed rising demands within Democratic ranks to penalize Israel for its conduct of the war and resistance to the delivery of humanitarian aid. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the seventh month of this war, and this administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on this Israeli government that normal humans would regard as serious or significant pressure,\u201d said Miller. Instead, Miller added, Biden is still operating primarily from the belief that to achieve his goals in the region \u2014 more humanitarian aid into Gaza, a ceasefire that leads to further hostage releases and eventually a regional accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201che cannot do that by creating a sustained public breach with the Israeli prime minister. He needs Israel\u2019s acquiescence if not its active assistance.\u201d Biden allies also believe Israel\u2019s critics within the party are overstating the political risks of his continued support. Though polls show widespread opposition to the war among both young people and Democrats more broadly, they also usually show that those voters prioritize other issues more. \u201cWhile some elements of the party\u2019s activist core are focused on what\u2019s happening in Gaza, most Democrats and most Americans are not,\u201d said long-time Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a pro-Israeli group. \u201cRather they are seized with other issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s holding down prices or protecting abortion rights or protecting democracy itself. \u201c But as the war persists \u2014 with the wave of campus protests compounding the fractures over the issue in the Democratic coalition \u2014 there are clear signs the party\u2019s center of gravity is moving away from the instinctive support for Israel expressed by older Democrats such as Biden and Schumer. The telltale sign is not the escalating outrage over the war from liberals long critical of Netanyahu and far-right Israeli governments, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House. Rather the key measure is the willingness of ambitious mid-career Democrats closer to the party center to criticize Israel\u2019s conduct of the war more openly and to indicate support for limiting the future transfer of offensive weapons; the list of Democrats in that camp include Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Biden only agreed to deliver the report due Wednesday on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and cooperation with international aid after pressure from a group of about 20 Democratic senators led by Van Hollen. Though almost all Democratic senators voted for the recent military aid package for Israel, Biden risks alienating many who supported the assistance if Wednesday\u2019s report to Congress does not seriously address whether Israel should be penalized for its actions in the war, said Amanda Klasing, the national director of government relations and advocacy for Amnesty International. Amnesty recently issued a report charging that Israel has targeted civilians with US weapons in violation of international law. \u201cBiden has a Democratic caucus that is putting a lot of faith in this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have taken these votes under the assumption that these conditions will be applied by the administration.\u201d The Israeli prime minister\u2019s personal relationship with Trump is prickly, but Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach toward both the Palestinians and Iran has encouraged the GOP\u2019s transformation into what Miller calls \u201cthe Israel can do no wrong party.\u201d If Israel elects a more centrist government in the future, Miller believes, the widening US partisan divide over Israel could narrow. But given the alienation about Israeli actions among Democratic partisans in general \u2014 and younger voters in particular \u2014 it seems virtually guaranteed that Democratic elected officials in the years ahead will face greater pressure than Republicans to maintain a critical distance from Israel. So far, Biden has been much more inclined to resist than respond to that pressure. A ceasefire could diffuse that pressure for a time. But even Biden may not be able to ignore the inevitable backlash among Democrats if Netanyahu, with or without a cease fire, eventually fulfills his pledge to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. The fierce Israeli response to the terrorist attacks of October 7 may leave in rubble not just much of Gaza, but the US tradition of bipartisan support for Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Nealy sued Warner Chappell Music, Inc., and Artist Publishing Group in 2018 for damages. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Nealy could sue for damages as far back as 2008 despite a three-year statute of limitations in copyright law, and on Thursday, the Supreme Court agreed. Some federal courts have allowed copyright plaintiffs to start the clock on that three-year window at the point they become aware of the alleged infringement, rather than when it is alleged to have occurred. Because of his prison sentences, Nealy said he didn\u2019t discover the use of the music until around 2016. The issue for the Supreme Court was how far back a plaintiff may seek for damages. At oral argument in February, several justices suggested that question was premature.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_donald-trump-trial-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump is heading into the most perilous phase of his hush money trial aside from the moment when the jury retires to consider its verdict. Former adult film star Stormy Daniels is back on the stand on Thursday to continue what has been at times explicit and cringe-worth testimony about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump nearly two decades ago, which set off a winding chain of events that led to the first criminal trial of an ex-president. Her evidence on Tuesday was deeply embarrassing for Trump and drew an aggressive cross-examination from his attorney trying to shatter Daniels\u2019 credibility. Trump spent Wednesday, the trial\u2019s off day, at home in Florida. He will return deeply at odds with Judge Juan Merchan, who had earlier threatened him with jail if he again infringes a gag order he has already flouted 10 times. Merchan also instructed Trump\u2019s attorney, Todd Blanche, to rein in his client after complaining that the defendant had cursed audibly and shaken his head during Daniels\u2019 testimony. The judge was concerned that the jury might notice the witness being intimidated \u2014 which he warned he could not allow to continue. So far, Trump \u2014 who has launched searing attacks on the judge \u2014 has managed to refrain from openly attacking Daniels since she took the stand. But her continued testimony will test him further. And her appearance is only an appetizer for expected explosive evidence in the coming days of the biggest star witness, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. His testimony is likely to be far more germane to the underling charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to buy Daniels\u2019 silence about the liaison she described on Tuesday. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Cohen at the epicenter of Trump\u2019s world Cohen \u2014 a colorful figure in his own right who often tried to replicate his boss\u2019 bravado, once saying he\u2019d \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump \u2014 facilitated the $130,000 payment to Daniels. The ex-president, who now views Cohen as a traitor, has spent months seeking to destroy his usefulness as a witness by highlighting time he spent in jail for what a judge once called \u201ca veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct.\u201d Daniels\u2019 testimony and a coming appearance from Cohen could amount to a forensic excavation of Trump\u2019s past life that he\u2019d much rather never saw the light of day \u2014 and the hush money payment he made before the 2016 election is proof of that. Now it\u2019s bubbling up years after the alleged transgressions took place during a new White House campaign. The coming days will therefore require qualities that Trump has always struggled to demonstrate in a riotous life in business and politics: restraint and self-discipline. Any behavior that could be construed as witness intimidation, or an attempt to influence the jury on social media or in the courtroom, could push Merchan over the red line he established earlier this week. The judge told Trump he didn\u2019t want to slap him with jail time, which could be as limited as a matter of hours, but if he had to act to protect the integrity of the trial, he would. Sarah Matthews, a former Trump White House deputy press secretary, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Wednesday that the former president\u2019s mood would be brittle following his ordeal in court on Tuesday. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be working on his campaign team or be one of his attorneys right now, just given, I think, that he\u2019s more than certainly lashing out at them. He\u2019s upset after that testimony,\u201d Matthews said. Yet Matthews argued that Trump could temper his reactions in public for fear of the consequences \u2014 even if he says he\u2019s willing to spend time behind bars to bolster his campaign narrative that he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see Donald Trump break the gag order again. Look, he\u2019s a germaphobe,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to go to jail, honestly. \u2026 I don\u2019t think that it will ultimately come to that. I think he\u2019ll push it up until the edge.\u201d Trump has a history of digging himself into deeper legal holes Cohen\u2019s time on the stand could be especially excruciating for the former president. While Daniels\u2019 account of their alleged encounter in a hotel suite in Lake Tahoe in 2006 was painfully embarrassing, she is not regarded as holding the key to the case against him. Prosecutors drew out her story because it was necessary to explain to the jury why Trump was so keen to hide it with a cash payoff before the 2016 election, which they allege was an attempt to mislead voters and interfere in a federal election. But Cohen is the most critical pillar of the entire case \u2014 his actions and knowledge get directly to the question of whether the former president knowingly falsified business records in a way that the prosecution can prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He can therefore be expected to face an even more withering cross-examination from Trump\u2019s legal team than Daniels did. Indeed, dismantling his evidence represents Trump\u2019s best hope of introducing doubt into the minds of one or more jurors that could lead to an acquittal. Trump\u2019s hair trigger temper is often activated when he feels he\u2019s being unfairly attacked. And his life\u2019s creed dictates that when he\u2019s hit hard, he hits back harder. His acting out was especially acute during the civil fraud trial targeting him, his adult sons and the Trump Organization that ended in a near half-billion-dollar judgment against them. His histrionics peaked with extraordinary testimony in his own defense that at times seemed more like a campaign stunt than a somber court proceeding. He constantly trampled court decorum and drove Judge Arthur Engoron to once plead with Trump\u2019s lawyer, \u201cI beseech you to control him if you can.\u201d While Trump wasn\u2019t sanctioned, the judge alluded to the former president\u2019s contempt for the case and the rule of law when detailing the massive fraud that was designed to get Trump more favorable treatment from financial institutions. Engoron said of Trump and his sons that \u201ctheir complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological.\u201d In yet another case, Trump\u2019s continued attacks on the writer E. Jean Carroll after a defamation trial factored into the size of an $83 million finding against him. The parallels are not exact in Trump\u2019s first criminal trial. Trump is not on the stand, so he has less opportunity to challenge Merchan\u2019s authority over the court. (Many legal experts believe any attempt by Trump to honor his vows to testify in his own defense would be a legal blunder of huge proportions). At the same time, however, the presence of a jury in this case means he has even less latitude to misbehave, especially after Merchan\u2019s two warnings put him on even thinner ice. A former president who built a personal brand on always being the most dominant figure in the room has been slow to learn that his displays of contempt in the courtroom keep getting him in trouble. The coming days of the hush money trial will show whether that has changed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/donald-trump-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_steve-bannon-appeal-denied", "text": "A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the contempt-of-Congress conviction of Steve Bannon, the ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump who was found guilty after failing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee. Bannon\u2019s conviction \u2014 and now, the DC Circuit\u2019s affirmation of that conviction \u2014 is a boost to Congress\u2019 leverage in its efforts going forward to obtain cooperation in its investigations. The US DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, including his claim that the trial court excluded evidence he should have been allowed to put before the jury in his defense. Bannon was sentenced to four months in federal prison, and that sentence was also upheld Friday by the appeals court. The ruling could pave the way for Bannon to eventually report to prison, though the timing is unclear. The judge who presided over Bannon\u2019s trial previously agreed to let him hold off from serving his sentence while his appeal played out. In its ruling Friday, the three-judge appeals panel gave Bannon time to appeal its ruling to the full DC-based appeals court before it formally notifies the trial judge that the conviction was upheld. Bannon could also turn directly to the Supreme Court for additional appeals, possibly further delaying when he needs to start serving his prison term. Bannon\u2019s attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. In the DC Circuit\u2019s new ruling, Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, backed the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of an advice-of-counsel defense, as Bannon had claimed he had rebuffed the subpoena because of supposed executive privilege concerns expressed to him by his lawyer. \u201cThis exact \u2018advice of counsel\u2019 defense is no defense at all,\u201d Garcia wrote, noting that the contempt law only required proof that Bannon \u201cdeliberately and intentionally\u201d did not respond to the subpoena. His opinion was joined by Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Trump-appointed Judge Justin Walker. The appeals court noted that \u201cthe communications from former President Trump\u2019s counsel\u201d that Bannon had tried to rely on to defend his conduct did not purport \u201cto authorize Bannon\u2019s refusal to produce any documents or appear for his deposition.\u201d The DC Circuit also rejected Bannon\u2019s argument that the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection was improperly formed. \u201cThese objections suffer from a common defect,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cBannon did not raise them before the Select Committee and therefore forfeited them.\u201d Bannon is one of two former members of Trump\u2019s inner circle who faced prosecution for not participating in the House January 6 probe. The second, former Trump White House aide Peter Navarro, is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction. When the now-defunct House panel sought documents and testimony from Bannon in 2021, it pointed to alleged communications between Bannon and Trump in the days leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as comments Bannon made on his podcast the day before the riot that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d Bannon for some time served in Trump\u2019s White House, but by the time of Trump\u2019s crusade to overturn his 2020 electoral loss, Bannon had long left the federal government.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_climate-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "It is not news that former President Donald Trump wants to hit rewind on President Joe Biden\u2019s climate policy. What is news is how far Trump may go. There\u2019s new reporting in The Washington Post that Trump, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, asked oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign so that he could upend efforts by Biden to push the US toward clean energy and electric vehicles. While the transactional nature of the pitch, as relayed to the Post, is overt and somewhat shocking, it\u2019s not out of step with Trump\u2019s view of politics or his insistence that climate change is a \u201choax.\u201d For evidence that climate change is not a hoax, read this CNN story about ocean temperatures. Or look at the pictures of hundreds of thousands of dead fish killed by a heat wave in Vietnam. I talked to CNN climate reporter Ella Nilsen about Trump\u2019s plans for a second term and Biden\u2019s record on climate change. Among the interesting things  I learned is that a lot of the money Biden and Democrats have spent to spur manufacturing has gone to red states. What would climate policy look like under Trump? WOLF: The Washington Post reports that Trump is promising oil executives a friendly administration if they raise $1 billion for his campaign. Politico reports the oil industry is crafting executive orders Trump could sign on day one. Trump has promised \u2013 in his \u201cdictator for a day\u201d fantasy \u2013 to act on immigration and energy production first. What do we know about how different US energy policy would be under Trump? NILSEN: In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration. Biden\u2019s administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump\u2019s actions \u2013 in some places enacting even stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from\u00a0vehicles,\u00a0power plants and the\u00a0oil and gas\u00a0industry. Trump has vowed to again reverse course from Biden; he wants to give a boost to fossil fuels and oil and gas drilling in particular. A mixed view of Biden WOLF: For all their rhetorical differences on climate, it\u2019s not like the US has cut oil production under Biden. In fact, the US remains the No. 1 world oil producer by a long shot. How do climate activists rate the current administration? NILSEN: Climate activists have a mixed view of Biden. On the one hand, he delivered on the most\u00a0ambitious piece\u00a0of climate legislation in modern history. His administration has also finalized some pretty ambitious regulations cutting planet-warming pollution, conserved a lot of public lands and created an American Climate Corps \u2013 a key demand of activists. On the other hand, the administration greenlit\u00a0the massive new oil drilling project\u00a0in Alaska known as Willow, which galvanized a huge amount of opposition from youth climate groups and on social media. Youth climate groups want Biden\u00a0to use executive authority\u00a0to stop drilling for fossil fuels \u2013 something that likely won\u2019t happen as\u00a0oil and gas production booms\u00a0in the US. Are we seeing payoff for all that climate spending Democrats enacted under Biden? WOLF: The money for climate in the  Inflation Reduction Act, which was backed by Democrats only, was sold as the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate policy. Are we seeing it pay off? NILSEN: Yes, so far. The IRA has already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new US manufacturing, largely for clean-energy industries like EVs, battery plants, and solar and wind production. A lot of this funding has been clustered in red states, but other 2024 swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia have been big benefactors. Why is the funding clustered in red states? WOLF: Is that a political move, or does it just have to do with the fact that it gets windy in Texas? NILSEN: You\u2019re right, it\u2019s very windy in a lot of red states \u2013 red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota are big wind-energy producers and consumers. But there are other reasons too. For instance, it\u2019s easier to permit and build in some red states, and others have relaxed union labor laws, another factor that draws big businesses. A third of US emissions are from one sector WOLF: I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of stories about a backlash to EVs. Trump falsely says Biden wants to ban gas-powered vehicles. How big a part does a transition to EVs play in addressing climate change? NILSEN: The vehicles we drive play a huge role in addressing climate change. Transportation emissions account for a little less than a third of total US emissions \u2013 the biggest individual sector for greenhouse gas pollution. Even accounting for mining for the critical minerals needed for EV batteries, EVs\u00a0are much cleaner\u00a0than gas-powered vehicles \u2013 assuming the power used to charge them is also coming from clean sources. Can states pick up the slack if the federal government turns on climate policy? WOLF: Even before Biden took office, states like California were taking the lead in a more climate-focused energy policy. Would that continue even if Trump wins? NILSEN: Yes, blue states like California and Washington state and even some Midwestern, purple states like Michigan and Minnesota have passed some very ambitious climate laws through their legislatures. That work will continue in the states even if Trump is elected. But given how quickly we\u2019re running out of time to get the planet\u2019s warming under control, it will be important to have the federal government moving in that direction as well. What is happening in Congress? WOLF: Better than presidents taking executive action or the Environmental Protection Agency writing a regulation to address the climate would be lawmakers passing a major piece of climate legislation. Are there any indications of movement toward a new national energy policy? NILSEN: Lawmakers passing the IRA was a huge achievement in its own right; however, multiple lawmakers have said the IRA was just the start. Given the 2017 Trump tax cuts are expiring soon, and Congress will have to take up tax policy in 2025, there\u2019s already chatter about a possible carbon tax, or a carbon tariff on polluting products like cement and steel, coming up in the legislature. Of course, what\u2019s possible in Congress depends tremendously on which party is in power \u2013 and who is in the White House.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/climate-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_us-gaza-pier-obstacles", "text": "Desperately needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza will at least for the next few days remain sitting off the coast of Gaza on\u00a0an American\u00a0Navy cargo ship, as the US continues to face obstacles to getting the floating pier it has constructed in place and operational in the eastern Mediterranean. The pier and causeway, known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore or JLOTS, will ultimately be used by the US, its allies and aid groups to get aid into Gaza by sea from Cyprus. But the system had to be moved to the Port of Ashdod last week due to heavy seas, and it still hasn\u2019t\u00a0left. Even when JLOTS becomes operational, the weather and sea conditions may severely limit the ability to use the floating pier. It can only be safely operated in conditions with a\u00a0maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour, according to a 2006 Naval War College paper on the systems limitations. A prediction of sea conditions from\u00a0Israel\u2019s Marine Data Center\u00a0shows waves are often at or near that 3-foot limit\u00a0in the area. \u201cJLOTS operations, which must take both safety and throughput requirements into account, must often wait for favorable weather and sea state conditions,\u201d the authors wrote. A defense official confirmed to CNN that the limitations on\u00a0the pier system are accurate. \u201cThe bottom line \u2013 heavy seas do have an effect on the ability to execute the JLOTS mission,\u201d the official said. If winds or waves are stronger, loading and unloading using the JLOTS pier becomes dangerous. Another potentially complicating factor is how Israel decides to proceed with its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, US officials said. A major Israeli offensive there could raise additional security concerns and impact the timing of when the pier and causeway are staged in the eastern Mediterranean. The planned staging area for the aid once it reaches Gaza has been hit by mortar and rocket fire at least twice in the last several weeks, CNN has reported. The US is still aiming to move the system into place and begin the operation \u201cin the coming days,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. For now, a massive barge called the M/V Sagamore that will be used to deliver the initial pallets of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier has begun to move the supplies to another ship currently off the coast of Gaza, called the M/V Roy P. Benavidez. The Benavidez, contracted by the\u00a0US\u00a0military, has been in the eastern Mediterranean since last month supporting the maritime corridor effort. Finalizing plans to transport aid to shore The US is also still working to finalize plans about who will actually transport humanitarian aid from the pier to the shore in Gaza, according to multiple US officials familiar with the matter. The UK had initially offered to provide personnel to help drive aid trucks from the US military-built causeway off the coast of Gaza to the shore, where it would be picked up by UN personnel overseen by the World Food Programme, officials said. But the British recently withdrew that offer amid security concerns, the sources said. The US, meanwhile, has ruled out using its own troops to drive the aid to the beach, because the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration does not want American personnel getting that close to Gaza, officials have said. A UK government spokesperson said that the UK does not \u201ccurrently have plans to deploy Armed Forces personnel onto Gazan soil as part of this initiative, but we are working closely with the US, Cyprus, and other allies to ensure aid can be quickly delivered over the pier once it is fully installed.\u201d Another diplomatic source familiar with the discussions confirmed that there had been conversations in which the UK had offered to drive the aid down the causeway to the pier, as part of \u201ca host of contingency plans\u201d that had been developed. \u201cBut for now there are no plans for the UK to be involved in that way,\u201d the source added \u201cThe most likely scenario is an as yet undecided third party.\u201d Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday that \u201cnon-US civilian contractors will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.\u201d One plan being discussed is for Israeli contractors to transport the aid, the officials and another source familiar with the matter told CNN.\u00a0But that could also change and is not finalized, despite the Pentagon predicting that the pier will be up and running in the next several days. The Israel Defense Forces have agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the\u00a0pier system and the aid operation. That has made some humanitarian groups and UN officials uneasy given the IDF\u2019s history of targeting aid convoys and the perception that they are working under the IDF\u2019s control, CNN previously reported. But the plan is for the IDF to remain at a relative distance as the aid is transported and offloaded onto the beach in Gaza, officials told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/us-gaza-pier-obstacles/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_michigan-2020-election-tampering-charges", "text": "Two prominent 2020 election deniers in Michigan were charged Wednesday with allegedly tampering with election equipment and sharing voter data with an unauthorized third-party. The defendants are former Adams Township clerk Stephanie Scott and pro-Trump attorney\u00a0Stefanie Lambert, who\u00a0is already facing charges in a separate election-tampering case in Michigan. Lambert also recently made news for publicly leaking emails from Dominion Voting Systems as part of her ongoing efforts to discredit the 2020 presidential election results. Scott was charged with six crimes, and Lambert was charged with three. Both women are accused of felonies, including conspiracy, and giving unauthorized access to a computer. Their alleged actions in Adams Township were one of several incidents across the nation \u2014 including in Georgia, Colorado and Pennsylvania \u2014 where prosecutors say Trump allies breached voting systems in hopes of proving that the 2020 election was rigged. Many are now facing criminal charges. \u201cStefanie Lambert has not violated the law,\u201d her attorney Daniel Hartman said, adding that she \u201cremains steadfast in her efforts to bring transparency to the people\u2019s election data, processes and procedures.\u201d Lambert has pleaded not guilty in her separate election-related criminal case. CNN could not immediately identify an attorney for Scott. She\u00a0has previously\u00a0denied wrongdoing\u00a0regarding her handling of sensitive voting equipment in the 2020 election. The charges were filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, whose office has aggressively\u00a0investigated\u00a0and\u00a0prosecuted\u00a0the GOP attempts to subvert the 2020 election. \u201cWhen elected officials and their proxies use their positions to promote baseless conspiracies, show blatant disregard for voter privacy, and break the law in the process, it undermines the very essence of the democratic process,\u201d Nessel said in a statement announcing the charges. Nessel\u2019s separate case against Michigan\u2019s fake pro-Trump electors from 2020 is ongoing, and former President Donald Trump was recently\u00a0named as a co-conspirator\u00a0in that investigation. Beyond the Michigan case, Lambert is expected to appear in Washington, DC, federal court next week, in connection with Dominion\u2019s defamation lawsuit against her client, ex-Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. Dominion wants Lambert removed from the case because she\u00a0leaked their private data. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_donald-trump-trials-delayed-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s public defense against his four, distinct prosecutions in four, separate jurisdictions is that they are a coordinated hit job and a political persecution \u2013 evidence, he says, of a double standard of justice. Disproving Trump\u2019s allegation is the likelihood, which seems to be growing this week, that three of the four criminal prosecutions might not reach the courtroom before Election Day. The other prosecution \u2013 generally seen as the weakest case against Trump \u2013 has provided salacious and embarrassing moments for the former president. But the facts of that case in New York, focused on his effort to hide an alleged affair rather than his conduct as president or his effort to overturn the 2020 election, feel like something from a different time. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases. If Trump could manufacture a conspiracy theory out of the fact that separate grand juries in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, DC, all independently approved charges against him, what would he make of the following series of events? Classified documents case postponed indefinitely Indictment: June 8, 2023, with a superseding indictment filed July 27, 2023. Trial date: Delayed indefinitely. Trump appointed the judge in the Florida case, Aileen Cannon, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything. But Cannon has angered critics who see slow-walking in the length of time she takes to return decisions and pandering in her deference to Trump\u2019s requests to delay the trial. On Tuesday, Cannon scratched the planned May trial date and did not pencil in a new one. With multiple outstanding issues in the federal case, legal experts are now doubting the trial \u2013 in which special counsel Jack Smith alleges Trump mishandled classified data he refused to turn over to the National Archives \u2013 will occur before November. Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Ty Cobb, now a Trump critic, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Tuesday night that Cannon has so far failed in the trial. \u201cI think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\u201d Cobb told Burnett. In the judge\u2019s slow work, Cobb sees \u201ca combination of bias and incompetence.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s slow schedule is helping Trump Indictment: August 1, 2023. Trial date: Delayed indefinitely. The other federal case, in which Smith accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results and rob Americans of their democratic rights, is also on hold in Washington, DC, thanks to the US Supreme Court. First, justices refused to fast-track reviewing Trump\u2019s dubious claim of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from criminal prosecution, instead preferring to allow that claim to proceed through oral arguments before a panel of judges in a lower court. When that lower court rejected Trump\u2019s absolute immunity claim, however, the Supreme Court suddenly wanted to have its say. Conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, seemed to not necessarily buy into the more outlandish extremes of his argument during a hearing last month \u2013 such as the hypothetical scenario of Seal Team 6 being ordered to take out a political rival \u2013 but they were intrigued enough to suggest their decision will not simply allow the trial to go forward. Whenever they get around to issuing it, that is. Could be June or July! Which would leave little time for a trial. Trump\u2019s effort to disqualify the prosecutor in Georgia continues Indictment: August 14, 2023. Trial date: Delayed indefinitely. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 relationship with a prosecutor shouldn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with the allegations against Trump, which are related to his effort to overturn election results in Georgia in 2020. But the fallout of her decision to employ her former boyfriend is helping Trump. The Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it would consider Trump\u2019s appeal of Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s decision to allow Willis to remain on the case. The New York Case is salacious, but where does it lead? Indictment: Unsealed April 4, 2023. Trial: Ongoing. The tawdry details of Trump\u2019s alleged affair with adult-film star Stormy Daniels are nothing Trump wanted to see, as he stared Daniels down in court on Tuesday. Trump\u2019s lawyers may drag out the cross-examination of Daniels when the trial resumes on Thursday as they seek to impeach her credibility. That should be a preview of the trial\u2019s coming showdown between Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen, an admitted liar and convicted felon, and attorneys for the boss for whom Cohen says he broke campaign finance law. There may have been a good reason federal prosecutors passed on this case and decided not to pursue it. The point here is that for all of Trump\u2019s controversial actions as president and his clear attempt to change election results, a conviction for falsifying business records, if it even comes, may not be what sways those few voters in swing states who will decide this election. Trump\u2019s prosecutions are no grand conspiracy of election interference. They\u2019re part of a slow-working justice system in which it helps to have the resources, thanks to donors, to pay an army of lawyers who can gum up the works. Trump\u2019s long-standing strategy is to delay his trials, get elected and then work to make them go away. From that perspective, this has been a good week for him.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/donald-trump-trials-delayed-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_biden-wisconsin-economy-inflation", "text": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday attempted to draw a direct line between his signature legislative achievements and shovels in the ground \u2014 and a direct contrast with\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 as he seeks to win over voters unhappy with the overall economy. Biden announced a $3.3 billion investment from Microsoft to build a new artificial intelligence facility located on the same site\u00a0where, in 2018, then-President Trump broke ground using a golden shovel on what was supposed to be a signature project under his administration: an electronics factory for Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn, which had secured billions in tax credits and promised thousands of jobs. Those investments largely\u00a0failed to materialize.\u00a0And in his remarks Wednesday, Biden directly blamed Trump for that failure. Trump, Biden said, \u201ccame here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world.\u201d \u201cAre you kidding me? Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it,\u201d the president said. \u201cFoxconn turned out to be just that - a con,\u201d Biden added. \u201cGo figure.\u201d The sprawling stretch of Racine County, which sits between Chicago and Milwaukee, has been at the center of an intense local political debate over the development through one whipsaw election after another. Residents who live and work nearby told CNN they were happy to see the projects \u2014 and the jobs \u2014 but it was hardly a guarantee that their own economic anxieties would be allayed. \u201cThings are really uncertain, not knowing what\u2019s going to happen with interest rates and what\u2019s going to happen with the whole economy,\u201d said Dave Flannery, whose family operates the Apple Holler orchard and farm just a few miles from where Biden is set to visit on Wednesday. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m very optimistic in terms of our future, but at times it\u2019s very scary out there.\u201d Tom Oberhaus, whose family owns Cozy Nook Farm\u00a0about an hour away near\u00a0Waukesha, said inflation is one of the biggest criticisms he has about the Biden administration. While he\u2019s not a huge admirer of Trump and hoped for a Republican alternative, he said he would gladly return to the economic policies of the Trump era. \u201cYou get your paycheck and it looks good, but when you pay the bills out, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow, it\u2019s all gone,\u2019\u201d Oberhaus said. \u201cTo me, inflation is the big overriding problem economically.\u201d Asked whether it was fair to place the blame entirely on Biden, Oberhaus said: \u201cThey are the administration that\u2019s in power.\u201d Biden the progressive At the outset of his term, Biden told some Democratic colleagues he planned to be the \u201cmost progressive president since FDR,\u201d the architect of the New Deal. Biden has spent the last two years on the road touting the trillions of dollars of infrastructure and construction spending that resulted from legislation he signed, much of it passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. But leading economists have argued the very funding that helped fuel economic growth also caused rising prices \u2014 clouding Biden\u2019s ability to sell those achievements to voters. \u201cIt\u2019s important for him to be here to hammer home his economic messages and make it real for people,\u201d Mandela Barnes, the state\u2019s former lieutenant governor, told CNN. \u201cSome people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.\u201d In CNN\u2019s\u00a0most recent poll,\u00a0Biden\u2019s approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests. As Biden leans into the unfinished business of his 2020 campaign \u2014 and urges voters to let him \u201cfinish the job\u201d in 2024 \u2014\u00a0multiple outside advisers and donors have expressed worry the president is tacking too far to the left.\u00a0The concern: A platform containing costly proposals like universal preschool, subsidized child and senior care, and expanded health care cater less to moderates than to the party\u2019s base. \u201cOne-eighth of one percent of the population is going to decide this election,\u201d\u00a0one longtime Biden donor tells CNN, requesting anonymity to share confidential conversations with the campaign.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve told them to move more toward the middle.\u201d Yet Biden is also still working to shore up his own progressive base, a task complicated by the rising outrage over the administration\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. \u201cAmericans deserve a President who is looking out for them and they have that in President Biden. Donald Trump on the other hand is proudly running to cut Social Security and Medicare, increase health care costs for everyday Americans, and send jobs overseas,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement to CNN. Wisconsin central to Biden reelection Wednesday was Biden\u2019s fourth trip to Wisconsin so far this year, an indication of how central the state is to the President\u2019s reelection roadmap. Wisconsin is a pillar of the so-called blue wall with Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 all three of which Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped four years later. In 2020, Biden won Wisconsin by fewer than 21,000 votes. And with a similarly small margin expected to select the 2024 victor, several advisers and former Biden officials have said that striking the right policy tone with moderates this year \u2014\u00a0without alienating the party\u2019s base \u2014 is paramount. \u201cI think that\u2019s the No. 1 question,\u201d\u00a0a former Biden adviser says of the debate over how progressive to fashion the president\u2019s approach.\u00a0\u201cAnswering that right is the answer of whether Biden wins the election.\u201d The Biden campaign and its acolytes don\u2019t see it that way, citing polling that shows the president\u2019s agenda has been popular among the party\u2019s most loyal voters, as well as independents. The White House points to figures from Navigator \u2013 a Democratic-aligned polling firm that bills itself as a \u201cresource for progressives\u201d \u2013 as informing its views of the agenda\u2019s popularity. In April, Navigator polled 1,000 voters on the policies in Biden\u2019s State of the Union address and found broad support. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to choose between a progressive path and a moderate path,\u201d said Bharat Ramamurti, Biden\u2019s former deputy director of the National Economic Council. \u201cThe agenda he has pursued is the consensus path.\u201d Policy shifts alongside party priorities As the Democratic Party\u2019s priorities evolve, consensus has taken different forms \u2014 and sometimes required Biden to shift his own positions to the left. A self-professed capitalist, he pledged during the 2020 campaign not to demonize the rich. Soon after taking office, Biden repeatedly began pushing for policies that tax wealthy individuals and corporations, a shift that emerged from a \u201cUnity Task Force\u201d established by the campaign seeking input from progressive economists. Perhaps no policy is more illustrative of this shift than student loan forgiveness. Biden started out the 2020 campaign supporting only the most limited student loan forgiveness \u2014 such as discharging loans when a borrower declared bankruptcy or died. But on the eve of a March 2020 debate with progressive firebrand Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was proposing blanket cancellation of student loans, Biden widened his embrace of loan forgiveness. And as president, Biden announced his support for income-based forgiveness that would cancel more than $360 billion in government loans. While that plan was blocked by the Supreme Court, Biden has used regulation and agency authorities to cancel some $146 billion in student debt. \u201cIt never felt like it was truly something he wanted to do during the campaign,\u201d\u00a0said the former Biden adviser.\u00a0\u201cAnd now it\u2019s one of his premier economic agenda items.\u201d Individual issues like student loan forgiveness tend to poll well among voters, especially young voters, whose monthly payments are a larger portion of their take-home pay. The White House cites findings from a focus group conducted by Navigator, the firm run by former Democratic campaign officials, as proof that voters want to see more government action on student loans. But when considered against a backdrop of other issues, or through the lens of Biden\u2019s approval rating, the numbers tell a different story. A\u00a0KFF poll earlier this year\u00a0found that only 32% of registered voters said it was very important for the presidential candidates to talk about student loan debt, well below the 83% who consider inflation a very important issue, 80% who say the same about the affordability of health care and 72% who consider the future of democracy that important. In CNN\u2019s\u00a0own polling last month, 24% of respondents called student loans an extremely important issue in making their choice for president, far below the 65% who called the top rated issue, the economy, that important.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_robert-f-kennedy-jr-abortion-limits", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he\u2019s against government limits on abortion at the federal or state level, backing legal abortions through the entire gestational period while arguing the state should not play a role in determining abortion access. In a podcast interview with Sage Steele that was released Wednesday, Kennedy said he doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust government to have jurisdiction over people\u2019s bodies\u201d and believes \u201cwe need to leave it to the woman \u2026 to make those decisions.\u201d Kennedy stressed he believes \u201cevery abortion is a tragedy\u201d and pledged as president to make child care more affordable to reduce pressures on women who are considering abortion due to high costs. When pressed by Steele if he supports allowing individual states to determine abortion access for women, Kennedy said, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have government involved.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave it to the states. My belief is that we should leave it to the woman. We shouldn\u2019t have government involved,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s full term?\u201d Steele asked, referring to the possibility of an abortion near the expected delivery date of a child. \u201cEven if it\u2019s full term,\u201d Kennedy replied. The position stands in contrast with previous statements Kennedy has made on abortion, and with how his running mate Nicole Shanahan has characterized his abortion position. In an interview with Steele released last week, Shanahan said, \u201cMy understanding is that he absolutely believes in the limits on abortion.\u201d When pressed by Steele to confirm if Kennedy supported no government limits on abortion, Shanahan said, \u201cThat is not my understanding of his position, and I think maybe there was a miscommunication there.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said the candidate believes \u201clate-term abortions are horrifying\u201d and that the \u201cthe mother has the final say, and moral responsibility, in such decisions.\u201d \u201cHe is committed to reducing the abortion rate by supporting mothers and families and implementing universally affordable child care,\u201d Spear said. Kennedy\u2019s comments to Steele reflect the most explicit articulation of his views on state or federal gestational limits on abortion.\u00a0Last year, Kennedy told a reporter he would support a three-month federal abortion restriction, but his campaign quickly walked back that position.\u00a0Kennedy has often avoided answering directly whether he supports limits on abortion while highlighting his plan to subsidize child care and expand access to adoption services. Kennedy acknowledged to Steele there is \u201ca compelling argument\u201d that the government should set a gestational limit on abortion access. He also conceded that his position is \u201cnot a very satisfactory outcome\u201d because of the potential for \u201cinstances where bad things happen.\u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s a very, very good argument, a compelling argument that the state has a interest in protecting a fully formed fetus. I absolutely think that that argument is very convincing,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cBut again, I come down to the fact that I don\u2019t trust the state, and I think we need to trust the woman. And I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s a satisfactory outcome because there\u2019s always going to be instances where bad things happen.\u201d Kennedy said he believes cases where a woman would potentially undergo a late-term abortion would be driven by \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d but reiterated his belief that the choice to have an abortion should be determined solely by the mother. \u201cI don\u2019t think any woman ever, ever in history has said, \u2018I\u2019m going to have a, you know, I\u2019m going to have a baby, I\u2019m going to get pregnant and carry that baby to eight months term and then I\u2019m going to terminate the pregnancy.\u2019 I don\u2019t think anybody wants to do that,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI\u2019m sure it has happened. I would say in almost all those cases, there\u2019s extenuating circumstances.\u201d \u201cBut I think, ultimately, nobody sets out to do that,\u201d he added later. \u201cAnd there are always some kind of extenuating circumstances that would make a mother make that kind of choice, a terrible, terrible choice which is, you know, you can\u2019t overstate how bad that is. And I think, ultimately, we have to trust women.\u201d Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, slammed Kennedy on Thursday for his remarks, with the group\u2019s president calling him a \u201ctrue extremist.\u201d \u201cHe would use the power of the federal government to wipe out protections for life in the states and impose unlimited abortion on demand all the way up to \u2018full term,\u2019 as he puts it, everywhere in America. That makes him unacceptable to millions of pro-life voters nationwide,\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign adviser who has helped him with outreach to Black voters, criminal justice and abortion policies, criticized the candidate\u2019s comments on Friday. She said it was the first time she had heard him voice such a perspective. \u201cIt is inexcusable to take the life of a full-term baby. Abortion at this stage does not prevent the need for delivery, as the baby must still be birthed, whether alive or deceased,\u201d Stanton King\u00a0said.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_inside-bidens-public-ultimatum", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision this week to make public his ultimatum that a major Israeli offensive in the city of Rafah would result in a shut-off of some US weapons did not come easily or lightly. It came after multiple rounds of phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, starting in mid-February, urging him to reconsider his plans to invade the densely populated city in southern Gaza that has been a critical conduit for humanitarian aid. Hours and hours of virtual and in-person meetings between Biden\u2019s top national security lieutenants and their Israeli counterparts were intended to send the same message,\u00a0according to officials: There are other ways to go after Hamas, Biden\u2019s aides laid out, that stop short of invading a city where more than a million Palestinians have gone to seek safety, officials said. At multiple levels, the president and his team warned Netanyahu that a major invasion of Rafah wouldn\u2019t be aided by American weapons. It was a message the White House believed was well understood by the government in Israel,\u00a0White House officials said Thursday. Still, making those warnings public was a step Biden had long been wary of taking. Doing so would amount to a turning point, and the biggest break in US-Israel ties since the start of the war in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. Even under pressure from progressives in his own party to take steps to limit humanitarian suffering in Gaza, Biden has been careful to avoid an open rift with Netanyahu. Still, in Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet meetings, a decision to go into Rafah appeared imminent. The Israel Defense Forces have now established a presence in Rafah and along its border, choking off two aid entry points and warning of a larger offensive to come. Ultimately,\u00a0officials said, Biden came to believe his warnings were going unheeded and so he changed course. Last week, Biden signed off on a pause of 3,500 bombs to Israel that administration officials feared would be dropped on Rafah. And on Wednesday, sitting at a community college in Wisconsin for an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, Biden made explicit to the world what he\u00a0said\u00a0he\u2019d\u00a0already\u00a0made obvious to Netanyahu in private. \u201cIf they go into Rafah, I\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities \u2013 that deal with that problem,\u201d Biden told Burnett. White House says ultimatum wasn\u2019t a surprise The president\u2019s aides said the message shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to their intended recipients in Israel. \u201cI can assure you the direct and forthright nature with which he expressed himself and his concerns in that interview with Erin Burnett is consistent with how he has expressed himself to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to Israeli officials,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. The Israeli government, Kirby said, \u201chas understood \u2026 for some time now\u201d the implications a major Rafah offensive would have on the future of American arms shipments. Aware or not of the president\u2019s views, Israeli officials reacted with shock to the public announcement. Netanyahu was defiant. \u201cIf we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that, if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,\u201d he said Thursday. Israeli officials also sought to downplay the significance of Biden\u2019s announcement. A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, said Israel already has the weapons it needs for the missions it is planning. In addition to 2,000-pound bombs, Biden told CNN that artillery could be held up in the event of a Rafah invasion. Despite being smaller in size than the bombs, the Biden administration views artillery as indiscriminate and imprecise weapons that can exact a dangerous toll in urban areas. Doubts over Israel\u2019s intentions in Rafah Israel has claimed its current campaign in Rafah is \u201climited,\u201d a description US officials have echoed. But behind the scenes, doubts linger about Israel\u2019s intentions, CNN has learned, with limited clarity provided to the US on how it plans to proceed. Throughout the course of the conflict, Biden\u2019s frustration with Netanyahu has grown, even as the US president maintained publicly that his support for the state of Israel was unwavering. Biden has made clear that no matter what course the Israel-Hamas war takes, the US would remain Israel\u2019s most stalwart ally so long as he is president. That conviction, advisers said, was separate and apart from the evolution of the president\u2019s relationship with Netanyahu. \u201cIsrael is not the same thing as Netanyahu,\u201d a senior Biden adviser told CNN. Rafah has hardly been the only irritant in the relationship. In the telling of Biden\u2019s close advisers, the IDF\u2019s accidental killing in early April of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza \u2013 one of them an American citizen \u2013 broke the president\u2019s already strained patience. Upon learning the news, Biden expressed fury,\u00a0advisers said. He made clear to advisers that he saw the deaths of the aid workers as an unacceptable \u201cbreakdown\u201d in some of the most fundamental ways in which he expected Israel to conduct its war, and that the moment required a new response.\u00a0His team quickly arranged a phone call with Netanyahu. The \u2018come to Jesus\u2019 moment Several weeks prior, Biden had shared with friends on Capitol Hill \u2013 in comments that were caught on a hot mic \u2013 that he and the prime minister were likely headed towards some kind of rupture. He predicted the two leaders were due for a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d moment. Multiple advisers did not deny that Biden\u2019s phone call with Netanyahu in April was, at the very least, as close to such a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d moment as the two leaders had had up until that point. In the brief call, Biden issued a new warning to Netanyahu: If Israel did not course-correct, the US would reconsider how it supports its ally in the conflict. It marked the clearest signal yet that six months into the war, Biden was starting to seriously consider conditioning US support for Israel. But even then, it was not known what exactly those consequences might look like, and what actions from Israel would ultimately push Biden over the edge. Since their call, the White House has praised Israel for taking steps to increase humanitarian aid, including opening additional crossings. Yet Rafah continued to shadow the relationship, as Israeli officials insisted on the necessity of going after Hamas in the city, even as Biden aides said they hadn\u2019t seen a plan to protect civilians there. Meetings between the two sides failed to yield consensus on the issue, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were unconvinced by Israel\u2019s plans to protect civilians and made clear in public statements that an invasion of the city would amount to a humanitarian disaster. \u201cThe president and his team have been clear for several weeks that we do not support a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere safe to go,\u201d Kirby said on Thursday. \u201cThe president has said that publicly and he has communicated that repeatedly and straightforwardly to Prime Minister Netanyahu.\u201d Bipartisan criticism follows Biden\u2019s public ultimatum After Biden\u2019s CNN interview, officials stressed the White House position on conditioning aid is a hypothetical one: The US would only pare back the equipment and weaponry provided to its longstanding ally if it launches the invasion of Rafah. That didn\u2019t stop the president\u2019s critics from accusing him of renouncing Israel, despite his clear statement that he wasn\u2019t \u201cwalking away from Israel\u2019s security.\u201d Across the GOP spectrum, from former President Donald Trump to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, Biden\u2019s political opponents likened the announcement to a message of an abandonment amid an ongoing war with terrorists. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u2019d just survived an ouster attempt, even suggested in an interview with Politico that Biden had a \u201csenior moment\u201d when he made the remark. Some Democrats also voiced criticism. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a staunch supporter of Israel, said that he disagreed with Biden\u2019s plan to withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, warning the move \u201cdemonstrates to Hamas that they\u2019re winning the PR war.\u201d \u201cI am concerned about that, and I don\u2019t agree with the president,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Sen. Jon Tester, a vulnerable Democrat from Montana, said, \u201cI think he should release it\u201d when asked about Biden\u2019s handling of the weapons shipments.\u00a0And Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said he was planning to speak with administration officials about the details of their plan later Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find out legally what they\u2019re doing and the reasons for it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, until I\u2019ve had a chance to talk to the administration, I\u2019m going to defer making any specific comments.\u201d Even though the president\u2019s position amounted to his toughest public stance on Israel since the start of the war, it also appeared to do little to satisfy those in his own party who have agitated for an end to US support. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good step forward. I think we\u2019ve got to do even more,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont democratic socialist, said on CNN, adding Biden\u2019s warning about conditioning weapons \u201cshould have come a lot earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

And his acknowledgement that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza was a stark recognition of the United States\u2019 role in the war. The president has come under extraordinary pressure, including from members of his own party, to limit shipments of arms amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Until now, the president had resisted those calls and strongly supported Israel\u2019s efforts to go after Hamas. Yet a looming invasion of Rafah, the city in southern Gaza where more than a million Palestinian civilians have been sheltering, appears to have shifted the president\u2019s calculus. \u201cWe\u2019re not walking away from Israel\u2019s security. We\u2019re walking away from Israel\u2019s ability to wage war in those areas,\u201d Biden said. Biden said while the US would continue to provide defensive weapons to Israel, including for its Iron Dome air defense system, other shipments would end should a major ground invasion of Rafah begin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks that came out of the Middle East recently,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s, it\u2019s just wrong. We\u2019re not going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.\u201d Already, the US has paused a shipment of \u201chigh-payload munitions\u201d due to Israel\u2019s possible operations in Rafah without a plan for the civilians there, according to the Pentagon, though it said a final decision on that shipment hadn\u2019t been made. The administration has said it is reviewing the potential sale or transfer of other munitions. Israeli officials privately expressed to US officials \u201cdeep frustration\u201d on the pause in shipments as well as the US media briefings on the decision, according to a source briefed on the matter. A potential rift Biden\u2019s public linking of American weapons shipments to Israel\u2019s conduct could widen a rift between himself and Netanyahu, with whom he spoke by phone on Monday. That conversation came as Israel ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from Rafah and launched strikes near border areas of the city. Biden said Israel\u2019s actions in Rafah had not yet crossed a red line of entering heavily populated zones, even if their actions had caused tensions in the region. \u201cThey\u00a0haven\u2019t gone into the population centers. What they did is right on the border. And it\u2019s causing problems with, right now, in terms of \u2013 with Egypt, which I\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure we have a relationship and help,\u201d he said. He said he had conveyed to Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders that American support for operations in population centers was limited. \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear to Bibi and the war cabinet: They\u2019re not going to get our support, if\u00a0in fact they go on these population centers,\u201d he said. Later, Biden described warning Netanyahu about the risks of becoming bogged down in Gaza, drawing parallels to the American experience in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cI said to Bibi, \u2018Don\u2019t make the same mistake we made in America. We wanted to get bin Laden. We\u2019ll help you get Sinwar,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the Hamas leader in Gaza. \u201cIt made sense to get bin Laden; it made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq they had a nuclear weapon.\u201d The conflict in the Middle East has consumed much of Biden\u2019s time over the past\u00a0months, even as he works to promote his domestic record to American voters.\u00a0His strong support for Israel has generated protests and anger, including on college campuses and at his events, where signs have labeled him \u201cGenocide Joe.\u201d Asked about the demonstrations, Biden said Wednesday: \u201cAbsolutely, I hear the message.\u201d But he warned against protests that veer into hate speech or antisemitism. \u201cThere is a legitimate right to free speech and protest. There\u2019s a legitimate right to do that, and they have a right to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There\u2019s not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people\u2019s access to class. That\u2019s against the law.\u201d Biden fights economic perceptions Biden was speaking Wednesday in Racine, Wisconsin, where he\u2019d just promoted new economic investments that could result in thousands of new jobs. In the CNN interview, he sought to\u00a0reframe perceptions of the American economy,\u00a0touting strong job growth and efforts to combat corporate greed while questioning surveys showing voters still pessimistic about the country\u2019s direction. \u201cWe\u2019ve already turned it around,\u201d Biden said, responding to a question on whether, less than six months before Election Day, he was running short on time to improve his standing among Americans on his handling of the economy. Biden pointed to surveys showing many Americans view their own economic situation favorably, even as they look negatively on the nationwide economy. \u201cThe polling data has been wrong all along,\u201d he said, questioning the effectiveness of phone surveys. And he said his own record on job creation following the Covid-19 pandemic was as clear an indication as any that conditions had markedly improved for American workers. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re in a situation where things are so bad that folks \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve created more jobs. We\u2019re in a situation where people have access to good paying jobs,\u201d he said. Still, he acknowledged there were good reasons for Americans to worry, including the cost of goods and housing. \u201cThe last I saw, the combination of the inflation, the cost of inflation, all those things, that\u2019s really worrisome to people, with good reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m working very hard to bring the cost of rentals down, to increase the number of homes that are available,\u201d he went on. \u201cLet me say it this way \u2013 when I started this administration, people were saying there\u2019s going to be a collapse to the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again \u2013 in the world.\u201d Biden has spent much of the last year working to promote his economic accomplishments, including new investments made possible by infrastructure and manufacturing legislation. That includes in Wisconsin, where he spoke Wednesday at a site where his predecessor Donald Trump once promoted an investment by the Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn that later failed. \u201cHe\u2019s never succeeded in creating jobs, and I\u2019ve never failed,\u201d Biden said in the interview, adding later: \u201cWhen has he even done anything he said? I\u2019m not being facetious. Think about it.\u201d Looking ahead to November Biden voiced little concern about his reelection prospects in the interview. But he warned Trump was unlikely to accept the results of the election if he loses. \u201cI promise you he won\u2019t,\u201d Biden said, \u201cwhich is dangerous.\u201d Asked what advice his former boss, President Barack Obama, had provided in their conversations about the race, Biden said it was simply to \u201ckeep doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019m feeling good about the trajectory of the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know as well I do, most people don\u2019t really focus and make up their minds until the fall. There\u2019s a lot going on, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d But surveys have shown voters giving Biden little credit for his economic record. In CNN\u2019s\u00a0most recent poll,\u00a0Biden\u2019s approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remain starkly negative, as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests. Biden said on Wednesday that \u201cno president has had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u201d \u201cIt was 9% when I came to office. 9%. But look, people have a right to be concerned. Ordinary people.\u201d Inflation actually peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. In January 2021, when Biden was sworn in, it was 1.4%. He touted his efforts to combat fees \u2014 including on bank accounts and credit cards \u2014 that the White House has said will lower Americans\u2019 bills. \u201cThe idea that you bounce a check and you get a $30 fee for bouncing the check? I changed that \u2013 can\u2019t charge more than eight bucks for that. Or your credit card. Your late payment. $35. I mean, there\u2019s corporate greed going on out there and its got to be dealt with,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_house-rejects-greene-motion-to-vacate", "text": "The House voted swiftly Wednesday evening to kill Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post. The resounding vote in Johnson\u2019s favor \u2013 which came with the help of Democrats \u2013 brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced, at least for now. As he navigates a razor-thin majority, the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues, though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank. Johnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote, calling Greene\u2019s campaign against him \u201cmisguided\u201d and thanking colleagues for a \u201cshow of confidence\u201d in his leadership. \u201cI want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made clear here every day, I intend to do my job, I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing, which I was elected to do. And I\u2019ll let the chips fall where they may.\u201d Greene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks, a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson. Johnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican. The House on Wednesday voted to table \u2013 or kill \u2013 Greene\u2019s push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven\u00a0Republicans voted against tabling. In the wake of Johnson\u2019s push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives, House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table. On Wednesday evening, Greene did not rule out forcing another vote against Johnson in the future and suggested that a statement from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social supports the potential for a motion to vacate at some point \u2013 despite the fact that he urged members to vote to kill her resolution. Pressed by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on whether she would trigger a vote again this Congress, Greene did not answer directly but said she is \u201cthankful\u201d for Trump\u2019s support and pointed to the fact that he said on Truth Social that \u201cat some point\u201d Republicans may be in a position of voting on a motion to vacate. \u201cHe also said in that statement that we may have to vacate and that\u2019s something that I think people need to pay attention to,\u201d Greene said. Asked whether she believes Trump was wrong to urge members to vote to table, the congresswoman said, \u201cI stand with President Trump. I support President Trump. I\u2019ve talked to him every day about this.\u201d House Republicans caught off guard Greene and Johnson \u2013 as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2013 met over several days earlier this week, where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson\u2019s leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair, which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure. House Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene\u2019s decision to trigger her motion, multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between\u00a0Johnson\u00a0and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken, the sources added. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN. CNN\u2019s Haley Talbot contributed to this report.  This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_rfk-jr-ballot-access", "text": "Before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the stage at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, last month, a team of his campaign staffers and volunteers organized hundreds of attendees through an assembly line of government forms, ID checks and color-coded wristbands. The bureaucratic workforce contrasted starkly against the classic rock music blaring over the speakers, the crowded bar at the back of the venue and the jovial spirit circulating among Midwesterners excitedly awaiting Kennedy\u2019s remarks. But the paperwork was a fundamental ingredient of the rally\u2019s significance. The independent candidate\u2019s campaign planned to use the event to qualify for Iowa\u2019s presidential ballot through a unique process that requires hundreds of registered voters in Iowa to sign up for a convention-like process to formally nominate Kennedy to appear on the state\u2019s ballot. The Iowa event is part of the Kennedy campaign\u2019s push for ballot access in all 50 states and Washington, DC, an undertaking that has endured hiccups and won incremental victories since the effort began last year, capitalizing on voters\u2019 appetite for an alternative to the presumptive nominees from the major parties, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. \u201cPeople on both sides are waking up and wanting an option,\u201d Dan Twelmeyer, a Kennedy supporter from Des Moines said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the lesser of two evils. They want\u00a0hope, he delivers a message of hope.\u201d After his remarks in Iowa, Kennedy doubled down on his audacious 50-state ballot access goal and said the campaign will achieve full ballot access in the next few months. \u201cWe will have ballot access in every state by the end of July,\u201d Kennedy told reporters. Whether Kennedy succeeds in his ballot access mission could have major implications on the playing field ahead of the presidential election. An NPR/PBS/Marist College national poll of registered voters released earlier this month showed Kennedy earning 11% support in a hypothetical five-way matchup between Biden, Trump, Kennedy, independent candidate Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Biden and Trump both received 42% support in the same poll. It\u2019s unclear if Kennedy would draw more support from Biden or Trump, but in a close race, a third-party candidate with substantial support has potential to tip the balance of the electoral map in unknown ways. In the 2020 election, Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin were all decided by margins of less than 1 percentage point. Drew Dietle, a 37-year-old Kennedy supporter from Golden Valley, Minnesota, says he believes the environment is ripe for someone like Kennedy to make a significant impact. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had two candidates like Trump and Biden who are more unpopular, and so I think the road is wide open for a third-party candidate to be successful this time around.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s ballot push could also go a long way to proving the legitimacy of his insurgent third-party bid in the eyes of voters who are curious about his message but concerned about his electability. Stefanie Westendorf, a 47-year-old plumber from Dayton, Ohio, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 but has also voted for Democrats in previous elections. She said she\u2019s considering voting for Kennedy because of his background in environmental advocacy and because \u201che\u2019s not a politician.\u201d Still, she\u2019s leaning toward supporting Trump in November because she doesn\u2019t think\u00a0Kennedy can qualify for the ballot in her state. \u201cI like Kennedy, but, you know, he\u2019s not gonna be on the ballot in Ohio,\u201d Westendorf told CNN in March. Kennedy is officially on the ballot in\u00a0five\u00a0states:\u00a0battleground Michigan, Utah, Hawaii, Delaware\u00a0and California. The campaign says it\u2019s gathered enough signatures to put Kennedy on the ballot\u00a0in two\u00a0more battlegrounds,\u00a0North Carolina and\u00a0Nevada,\u00a0as well as\u00a0Ohio,\u00a0Idaho, Nebraska and Iowa. The campaign has adopted a wide range of methods meant to find the easiest way to navigate the often disparate and convoluted processes to meet different ballot qualification criteria in each state. Volunteers have collected signatures outside sporting events, on college campuses, at festivals and state fairs and more across the country. The campaign has even drafted off the exposure of more prominent political events: Volunteers collected enough signatures to appear on the New Hampshire ballot by canvassing voters at polling places on the day of the Granite State\u2019s presidential primary in January. The campaign typically aims to collect at least 60% more signatures than the required amount in each state, a campaign official told CNN, to avoid invalidated signatures undermining Kennedy\u2019s petition. Kennedy has also reached out to minor parties with ballot eligibility in some states to circumvent the signature-gathering process altogether, making strange bedfellows of Kennedy and some fringe political groups. He\u2019ll appear on Michigan\u2019s ballot on the Natural Law Party line, a party best known for promoting transcendental meditation. In California, Kennedy will be on the ballot thanks to the American Independent Party, a group founded in the 1960s to promote segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace\u2019s third-party bid in 1968. In a video statement announcing his California ballot qualification, Kennedy condemned Wallace\u2019s views and said the party has \u201cbeen reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred, but rather compassion and unity and idealism and common sense.\u201d Sierra Lyons attended a Kennedy campaign event in Michigan celebrating his ballot access win in the state along with her mother. A native of Macomb County who voted for Trump in 2020, she\u2019s been volunteering for Kennedy since last year. She said she\u2019s excited to have the chance to vote for Kennedy, despite criticisms from Democrats and Republicans that Kennedy could be a spoiler for Biden or Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not even letting myself go there because I\u2019m not going to vote for Biden or Trump, just because people say the odds are stacked against Kennedy,\u201d Lyons said. Roadblocks to access The campaign\u2019s ballot access infrastructure is overseen by campaign manager Amaryllis Fox Kennedy and Nick Brana, the campaign\u2019s ballot access director, who coordinate strategy with staff and volunteers in each state. Trent Pool, a key ballot access consultant who has worked with the campaign since last year, has helped bring professional petition circulators into the campaign as it ramps up signature gathering in several states. (Pool was charged with assault in Manhattan last week, a New York police spokesperson told CNN. Pool\u2019s attorney told CNN he is \u201cinnocent of all charges.\u201d) The team works closely with Paul Rossi, the campaign\u2019s lead ballot access attorney who has spearheaded lawsuits challenging petition filing deadlines and signature gathering protocols and coordinated the campaign\u2019s defense against legal challenges over its ballot access work. In Utah, the state moved back its petition deadline for independent candidates after Kennedy sued the state. In Idaho, the state legislature changed its statutes on petition gathering after the campaign filed a lawsuit challenging its petition deadline and rules around signature gathering. And in Hawaii, the campaign successfully defended a challenge to invalidate its ballot petition from the state Democratic Party despite not being formally represented in the hearing by an attorney. Despite those legal victories, Kennedy still faces a long road to nationwide ballot access. The campaign has yet to file petitions in most states, which will subject the campaign to scrutiny from more state elections officials and outside groups over the validity of their petitions and their signature collection methods. The campaign has already faced issues in Nevada, after the Secretary of State\u2019s office admitted it \u201cprovided inaccurate guidance\u201d to the Kennedy campaign regarding whether it needed to announce Kennedy\u2019s vice presidential running mate prior to gathering signatures in the state. The campaign is waiting to submit petitions in states where it said it has collected enough signatures to qualify until the deadlines in those states draw closer in hopes of reducing opportunities for legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans, a second campaign official told CNN. American Values 2024, a super PAC backing Kennedy, had initially outlayed an eight-figure initiative earlier this year to gather signatures on behalf of Kennedy in some states. The PAC said it gathered enough signatures to put Kennedy on the ballot in Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and South Carolina. But in the wake of a Federal Elections Commission complaint filed by the\u00a0 Democratic National Committee alleging the PAC illegally coordinated with the Kennedy campaign to set up the ballot access operation, the PAC has abandoned its plans despite spending more than $2 million on the effort, a PAC official told CNN. While most states require candidates to collect under 10,000 signatures to qualify, some states require candidates to meet significantly larger thresholds. Florida, for example, requires candidates to collect more than 145,000 signatures to qualify in the state. But Kennedy has expressed optimism about hitting signature targets in some states with the largest thresholds, like New York and Texas. New York in particular is a priority for Kennedy due to the state laws that require a high volume of signatures to be gathered in a short six-week window, the second campaign official told CNN, and the campaign sees qualifying in the state as a critical step in gaining ballot access nationwide. The campaign has volunteers in all 62 counties in New York working to collect the necessary 45,000 signatures before the state\u2019s petition filing window closes at the end of May. Matt Rigolini is a 43-year-old health care worker from Huntington, New York, who\u2019s backing Kennedy. He said he didn\u2019t vote in the 2020 election and would stay home again unless Kennedy is able to qualify for the ballot in New York. \u201cIf Kennedy wasn\u2019t on the ballot whatsoever, I would not be showing up to the polls. I have zero interest if he\u2019s not on the ballot,\u201d Rigolini said. \u201cTrump is a non-option, and Joe Biden\u2019s a non-option. So I would just be happy to sit that one out.\u201d The legal battles and signature-gathering challenges amount to financial hurdles that typically prevent independent candidates from gaining ballot access nationwide. Kennedy\u2019s campaign ended March with about $6 million in cash on hand after ramping up spending in March to $4.5 million. But the campaign has received a significant financial boost from Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy\u2019s independently wealthy vice presidential nominee, who contributed $2 million to the campaign in March. Politicians can contribute unlimited sums of money to their own campaigns, meaning Shanahan could continue to provide liquidity as the ballot access effort picks up steam. For Kennedy, gaining ballot access is the first measure of his outsider campaign\u2019s potency in the race. For some voters, their support for Kennedy is predicated on whether he can compete in every state. Debra Chilcott, 57, said she hopes Kennedy has enough support nationwide to get him on the ballot in every state. But Chilcott, a paralegal from Patchogue, New York, said that if he doesn\u2019t get on the ballot everywhere, she\u2019ll likely vote for Trump, whom she\u2019s supported previously. \u201cI want to obviously put my money where the best bet is,\u201d she said. But while obtaining ballot access nationwide would mark a major milestone for Kennedy, it\u2019s unclear at this point whether their grassroots outreach for petition signatures will help build support for Kennedy in November. Benjamin Novak, a Maryland voter and a senior at Towson University, gave his signature to help Kennedy get on the ballot in Maryland. He said he hopes Kennedy can gain ballot access across the country for the benefit of voters who want to support him. But he said he\u2019s planning on voting for Biden in November. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be honest, I\u2019m not a huge Kennedy fan but I think it\u2019s important to have options for third-party candidates even if they\u2019re not your favorite. It sets a good precedent for the future,\u201d Novak said. But for some voters, the opportunity to potentially cast a ballot for a high-profile third-party candidate is an exciting prospect. Doniella Pliss, a 52-year-old from Springfield, New Jersey, said she\u2019s planning to vote for Kennedy if he qualifies in her state. She\u2019s voted for third-party candidates previously but typically supports Democrats. She said she hopes to be able to vote for Kennedy because he aligns with her values. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not a rich person. I cannot buy influence.\u00a0 All I can offer is my vote. I value it very highly. My vote is never wasted,\u201d Pliss said. \u201cDo I see a path to victory? In an ideal world, maybe. In practical terms, maybe not. But for me personally, this vote is more of my choice, and my action and my civic duty. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to use it for.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/rfk-jr-ballot-access/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_report-looms-biden-israel-international-law", "text": "The Biden administration is rushing to finish a high-stakes report\u00a0due\u00a0to Congress this week on whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law during its war in Gaza \u2014 a determination that\u00a0could\u00a0lead to significant\u00a0repercussions\u00a0and further inflame divisions at home and abroad. The report has been the subject of intense debate for months across the administration and has already led to deep divisions inside the State Department, where\u00a0some offices\u00a0have expressed doubt over Israel\u2019s assurances that it has used US weapons without violating international law during its 7-month war in Gaza. The report, which\u00a0will also weigh in on whether Israel has impeded the delivery of US humanitarian assistance, comes at a pivotal moment in the war. Israel appears on the precipice of an incursion into the southern city of Rafah, something President Joe Biden has warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against. Meanwhile Hamas and Israel remain unable to reach a ceasefire\u00a0and hostage release\u00a0agreement as numerous American universities cancel graduation ceremonies after pro-Palestinian protests erupted on campuses over the past few weeks. Under pressure from Democrats in Congress, Biden agreed in February to\u00a0issue a new national security memorandum that would\u00a0examine Israel\u2019s conduct and use of US weapons in its war against Hamas.\u00a0That memorandum requires\u00a0all countries using US weapons to attest that they are doing so consistent with\u00a0international human rights law,\u00a0with an expedited timeline for those in an active conflict. Secretary of State Antony Blinken faced an initial deadline of Wednesday May 8 to report to Congress whether the administration finds those assurances to be \u201ccredible and reliable.\u201d\u00a0On Wednesday, the State Department said it would not deliver the report on time. \u201cWe expect to deliver it in the very near future, in the coming days,\u201d State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a briefing, adding that the department is still finishing the report. \u201cWe are trying very hard to meet that deadline,\u201d Miller said on Tuesday, noting that it\u2019s the first time the department has written a report of this nature. \u201cIt\u2019s possible it slips just a little bit.\u201d The State Department has remained\u00a0largely quiet on\u00a0the production of the report,\u00a0only saying that \u201ca broad spectrum of the department will contribute to this report.\u201d\u00a0Insight has been limited from Capitol Hill, where congressional sources said the expectation is that the report will cover\u00a0the time period from January 2023 to present. Congressional sources told CNN it was their understanding that the report was drafted by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs with input from other parts of the agency, and with the involvement of the Defense Department and National Security Council. Though the report does not mandate a change in US policy, it could be used to trigger one. Israeli officials, deeply wary that its findings could increase pressure on Biden to condition US military aid to Israel, have been in close touch with the administration as the report has developed,\u00a0congressional\u00a0sources said. If the report were to find that Israel is not in compliance with international law, it would likely trigger a firestorm within the Netanyahu government. The Israeli prime minister and other top members of his government recently railed against potential restrictions in military aid to an Israeli military unit found to have committed gross violations of human rights prior to the war in Gaza. Although Biden administration officials have become increasingly outspoken about the humanitarian catastrophe resulting from the war, they\u00a0have largely avoided\u00a0punitive measures\u00a0against Israel. Administration officials on Tuesday night acknowledged the first-known hold to\u00a0military assistance to Israel. Last month, Biden warned Netanyahu that Israel had to do more to address the humanitarian situation or there would be a change in US policy. Late last month Amnesty International assessed that US-supplied weapons to Israel have been used \u201cin serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and in a manner that is inconsistent with US law and policy.\u201d An independent task force led by a former State Department official who quit over US support for Israel and\u00a0a human rights attorney\u00a0who is also a Palestinian American activist\u00a0also concluded\u00a0that\u00a0Israeli forces operated in a way that showed a \u201csystemic disregard for fundamental principles of international law\u201d while using US weapons. The report cites seven\u00a0specific examples of such violations, including an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) attack on\u00a0Jabalya refugee camp on October 9\u00a0which left 39 people dead and for which the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights found no specific military objective. Democrats amp up pressure on Biden Democrats in both the House and the Senate have urged the Biden administration not to take Israel\u2019s assurances at face value. Last month, more than two dozen House Democrats wrote a blistering letter to administration officials saying that \u201ca failure to question, at a minimum, the Netanyahu government\u2019s assurances\u201d\u00a0is antithetical to the national security memorandum\u2019s purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to take at face value an explanation that you receive. We need to see evidence,\u201d said\u00a0Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who helped craft the memo Biden signed in February. Though he voted for the recent aid package that included $15 billion in military aid for Israel, Van Hollen said he believes that the Biden administration needs to pause any transfers of offensive weapons to Israel until Biden\u2019s demands of Israel have been met. One Republican congressional aide\u00a0predicted\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019ll be some fratricide within the Democratic Party on this.\u201d Top Republican lawmakers on the foreign affairs committees in the House and Senate\u00a0have decried\u00a0the national security memorandum as \u201ca redundant requirement that adds unnecessary bureaucracy and contributes to frustration from the partners and allies that count on U.S. security assistance.\u201d As of Monday, the report was still being worked on, according to Miller, the State Department spokesperson. \u201cIt is something that we take incredibly seriously and there\u2019s a lot of work going on at the Department to make sure we fulfill that obligation and we fulfill it thoroughly,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making our own assessments not just based on what those governments have told us, but based on what we have seen in our review here at the State Department,\u201d he added, saying that Israel provided its assurances to the US at the end of March. Numerous humanitarian officials from around the world have made clear that they believe there have been violations of international law and have said they have shared their views on the memorandum with USAID,\u00a0the US\u2019 lead humanitarian agency. They told CNN that accepting Israel\u2019s assurances that they are in compliance with the law would undermine US credibility. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there have been violations,\u201d one humanitarian official said. \u201cFrankly, why are people starving and why did you finally decide to drop aid from the sky or build a very expensive port if you yourself had not determined that aid is being blocked?\u201d This story has been updated with news that the State Department will not meet the May 8 deadline to deliver its report to Congress.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/report-looms-biden-israel-international-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_louisiana-supreme-court-congressional-map", "text": "Civil rights groups urged the US Supreme Court to step into Louisiana\u2019s fraught and potentially far-reaching redistricting battle on Wednesday, asking the justices to rule against some White voters who claim the state legislature violated the Constitution when it drew a second majority-Black district in its congressional map. The emergency appeal has once again thrust race onto the high court\u2019s docket \u2013 and yet again with a short fuse. Louisiana officials say they want a decision by May 15 to have time to administer this year\u2019s elections. Because the case raises fundamental questions about how mapmakers consider race when they redraw congressional boundaries every decade, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision could have national implications. It could also affect control of the US House, given the narrow majority Republicans currently hold in that chamber. At issue is a map drawn by state lawmakers that included a second majority African American district in Louisiana\u2019s six-district congressional plan. A conservative leaning lower court ruled against that map last week, which, according to civil rights groups, has left \u201cLouisiana without a congressional map just months away from the 2024 elections.\u201d Black voters, the civil rights groups noted, \u201chave already been compelled\u201d to vote on a map that lower courts ruled violated the law, with the groups pointing to a separate court\u2019s ruling that said a congressional map that had only one majority-Black district \u2013 the map that was ultimately used in 2022 \u2013 likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, the groups argued Wednesday, \u201cis needed to ensure that harm is not repeated.\u201d The Supreme Court could allow the newly drawn congressional districts to be used in this year\u2019s election. Or it could deny the emergency appeal, an outcome that could put the onus on either the state\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature or a conservative-leaning lower court to redraw the map. The lawsuit was filed in January by a dozen voters who identified themselves as \u201cnon-African American\u201d and claimed the state violated the equal protection clause when lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district \u2013 in other words that the new map discriminated against them. The map Louisiana initially drew after the 2020 census made only one of the six congressional districts a majority-Black district, even though African Americans make up nearly a third of the state\u2019s population. A group of Black voters sued over that map in 2022 and secured a preliminary order from a judge declaring the map a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act, before the case went up to the Supreme Court. The court froze the litigation \u2013 and allowed the contested maps to be used in the 2022 midterm election \u2013 while it considered a similar redistricting appeal from Alabama, Allen v. Milligan. A year later, in mid-2023, the Supreme Court handed down an unexpected 5-4 ruling in the Alabama case, finding that the state\u2019s map diluted Black voting power in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It then returned Louisiana\u2019s litigation to a lower court and the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature ultimately wound up drawing a new map. Within a matter of days, lawmakers created a new 6th District that stretched about 250 miles across the state, from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, in which roughly 54% of the voters are Black. Throughout the process, Republican lawmakers suggested in public statements that a primary motivation was to adhere to court orders and draw a second majority Black district. However, much of the discussion around reworking the congressional plan also focused on protecting certain congressional incumbents and particularly the incumbents in House GOP leadership, Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise. The new lawsuit raises a question that has come up repeatedly at the Supreme Court in recent months: How deeply may policymakers consider race as they try to address historic and systemic racism. The Supreme Court has broadly allowed states to consider race as they draw political boundaries as long as race doesn\u2019t become a \u201cpredominant factor.\u201d Defenders of the map with two majority Black districts also argue that the state has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in complying with the Voting Rights Act that allows lawmakers to consider race in a limited way. A federal court last week ruled that Louisiana lawmakers went too far, creating a racial gerrymander as they reshaped the 6th District. A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the new maps cannot be used in this year\u2019s election. The two judges in the majority were both nominees of former President Donald Trump and a third judge, who dissented, was nominated by former President Bill Clinton. Days later, the lower court gave the state legislature until early June to redraw the map. If lawmakers fail to meet that deadline, the court said it would draw its own. The Supreme Court is already weighing a separate equal protection challenge over South Carolina\u2019s congressional maps. The South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and a Black voter named Taiwan Scott claimed the use of race dominated the decision-making and that the state intentionally diluted the power of Black voters. A federal court agreed last year, referring to the revised map as a \u201cbleaching of African American voters.\u201d The justices heard arguments about the South Carolina map in October and are expected to issue a decision before July. Given the delay in the Supreme Court issuing its decision, the lower court has ruled that the 2024 elections can proceed under the map it previously deemed unconstitutional.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/louisiana-supreme-court-congressional-map/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Scott Perry of Pennsylvania said in a closed door briefing with lawmakers on Tuesday that the\u00a0Ku\u00a0Klux Klan is the \u201cthe military wing of the Democratic party\u201d and that migrants coming to the US \u201chave no interest in being Americans,\u201d according to audio of Perry\u2019s comments shared with CNN. Perry, a right-wing Republican who has\u00a0repeated\u00a0elements of the anti-immigrant and antisemitic replacement theory before, said this during the House Oversight Committee\u2019s member briefing entitled \u201cthe Origins and Implications of Rising Antisemitism in Higher Education.\u201d The briefing comes ahead of the Oversight panel\u2019s hearing on Wednesday about the District of Columbia\u2019s response to the pro-Palestinian protests and encampments occurring on college campuses, as House Republicans attempt to crack down on the demonstrations making waves across the country and\u00a0attempt\u00a0to unify around a firm position against antisemitism.\u00a0That hearing was canceled Wednesday morning\u00a0after the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC, cleared out a pro-Palestinian encampment on George Washington University\u2019s campus early Wednesday and arrested 30 protesters there and three others in a separate altercation, Metro Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said. \u201cThe KKK in modern times, a lot of young people think somehow it\u2019s a right-wing organization when it is the military wing of the Democratic Party. Decidedly, unabashedly, racist and antisemitic,\u201d Perry said according to the recording. The KKK is not affiliated in any way with the modern Democratic Party. Perry then defended replacement theory, which is the idea that white people are being slowly and intentionally replaced by minorities and immigrants. \u201cReplacement theory is real\u201d Perry said according to the recording shared with CNN.\u00a0\u201cThey added white to it to stop everybody from talking about it.\u201d While Perry said he is happy to accept people \u201cthat are here legally,\u201d pointing to his ancestors who migrated to the US, he has an issue with migrants that are \u201cun-American.\u201d \u201cWhat is happening now is we\u2019re importing people into the country that want to be in America \u2026 but have no interest in being Americans, and that\u2019s very different and to disparage the comments is to chill the conversation so that we can continue to bring in more people that we never met that are un-American,\u201d Perry said,\u00a0according to the recording. Perry claimed his words were twisted when presented with his closed-door remarks. \u201cOnce again, the radical Left twists facts in order to silence conversation about its own crimes and Biden\u2019s intentional failures to enforce laws and close or regulate our borders. My point is proven yet again: when the Left loses an argument, it debases and smears instead of engaging in debate on merits,\u201d Perry said in a statement provided to CNN. Replacement theory is\u00a0the idea that white people are being slowly and intentionally replaced by minorities and immigrants.\u00a0The xenophobic and racist rhetoric\u00a0associated with the theory\u00a0has found its way into the mainstream of American politics and elements of it\u00a0appear\u00a0to have motivated some of the most heinous recent mass murders in the US and around the world.\u00a0There are specific antisemitic elements of the unfounded theory as well, that Jews specifically are organizing a flood of non-white immigrants.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/scott-perry-closed-door-comments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_05_politics_fact-check-trumps-false-courthouse-claims-last-week", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to make false claims about his New York trial. Trump frequently speaks to media cameras before entering and after exiting the Manhattan courtroom where he is facing charges of falsifying business records.He has peppered his hallway remarks with inaccurate assertions about a variety of subjects \u2014 most frequently about the trial itself. Here\u2019s a fact check of four false claims and one misleading claim he made about the trial in his courthouse comments last week. (And here\u2019s a link to our fact check of his courthouse falsehoods from the week prior.) Trump\u2019s right to testify Trump falsely claimed after leaving the courtroom Thursday afternoon that he is not allowed to testify in his own defense \u2013 then acknowledged Friday morning that he is indeed allowed to testify. Trump\u00a0told\u00a0reporters Thursday, \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to testify. I\u2019m under a gag order. I guess, right?\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to testify, because this judge, who\u2019s totally conflicted, has me under an unconstitutional gag order.\u201d He continued by complaining that he\u2019s \u201cnot allowed to talk\u201d even when others attack him, then said again, \u201cSo I\u2019m not allowed to testify because of an unconstitutional gag order.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. As he noted the next day, he is allowed to testify at the trial; the decision is entirely up to him.\u00a0Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s gag order, which narrowly restricts his out-of-court speech, does not in any way stop him from testifying. The gag order also does not broadly prevent Trump from talking. He is permitted to speak to the media, speak at campaign events, attack President Joe Biden and other political opponents, and even attack Merchan and the Manhattan\u00a0district attorney behind the case. On Friday morning, Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0as he entered the courtroom: \u201cNo, it won\u2019t stop me from testifying. The gag order\u2019s not for testify[ing]. The gag order stops me from talking about people, and responding, when they say things about me.\u201d When court proceedings began shortly after, Merchan told Trump that he has the \u201cabsolute\u201d right to testify and that the gag order \u201cdoes not prohibit you from taking the stand and it does not limit or minimize what you can say.\u201d Rather, the gag order\u00a0forbids Trump from three specific categories of speech: 1) Speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about known or foreseeable witnesses, specifically about their participation in the case; 2) Speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about prosecutors (other than Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg), members of the district attorney\u2019s staff and the court staff, or family members of any of these people including Bragg, if those statements are made with the intent to interfere with the case; 3) Speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about jurors or prospective jurors. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0made the gag order sound far broader than it is. He\u00a0claimed\u00a0at a Wednesday campaign rally in Michigan that \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be, I would say, talking to you, because he gagged me\u201d \u2013 though the gag order actually says nothing to prevent him from making a campaign speech. Merchan wrote in the gag order: \u201cDefendant has a constitutional right to speak to the American voters freely, and to defend himself publicly.\u201d Trump\u2019s public stance on whether he will testify has varied. After declaring before the trial started\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m testifying,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a television interview last week that he would testify \u201cif it\u2019s necessary.\u201d Thursday was the first time he has publicly claimed he is not permitted to testify. Trump and bail Trump said: \u201cNew York City is a violent city; it\u2019s become violent with the cashless bail. I\u2019m the only one who has to put up bail.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. Like many other New York defendants whose alleged crimes are\u00a0non-violent, he\u00a0didn\u2019t have to put up bail. After his arraignment in 2023, he was released on his own recognizance \u2014 in other words, without having to post any cash.\u00a0 Trump did have to post\u00a0a $200,000 bond\u00a0in his separate election subversion case in Fulton County, Georgia (contributing 10% himself\u00a0and working with a bail bonds company to cover the rest), but his clear Friday suggestion was that he is being treated uniquely harshly in New York. He was released on his own recognizance in his two\u00a0federal\u00a0criminal\u00a0cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one in Washington, DC, over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and one in Florida over his post-presidency retention of classified documents. Trump\u2019s assertion that New York City is \u201ca violent city\u201d is subjective. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that violent crime in the city has\u00a0plummeted over the last two decades, that the city has long had\u00a0lower crime rates than many other big and small communities\u00a0around the country, and that the impact of New York state bail reforms on the city\u2019s recent crime levels is disputed. Trump\u2019s campaign schedule Trump continued Friday to complain that the New York trial is preventing him from being on the campaign trail. This time, he said: \u201cWe were already marked down \u2014 months ago, we were marked down to be in Georgia today, where we\u2019re doing very well at the polls, by the way. But that\u2019s where we were supposed to be. We\u2019re supposed to be in Ohio tomorrow and we\u2019re supposed to be in Florida on the next day, doing \u2014 campaigning, essentially campaigning. So now I have to go through this trial day after day.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that the trial is preventing him from having campaign events this weekend is false. The trial is not being held on weekends (or on Wednesdays), so he was free to campaign wherever he wants on Saturday and the day after \u2014 and he was planning to fly to Florida.\u00a0Trump was scheduled to headline a closed-door\u00a0Republican National Committee fundraising luncheon at his Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, and he attended the Miami Grand Prix Formula One race on Sunday.\u00a0 There is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s claim that he was supposed to be in Ohio on Saturday; he is\u00a0planning to visit the state on May 15, another court-free Wednesday. And it\u2019s unclear what his campaign internally \u201cmarked down,\u201d but he had never publicly scheduled a campaign event for Georgia on Friday. Trump\u00a0held campaign rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, and he had a rally planned for North Carolina the previous Saturday that was\u00a0called off because of severe weather. However, he has regularly declined to visit swing states or hold public events on his days without court,\u00a0opting instead\u00a0to host dinners and meetings at Trump Tower in Manhattan or to play golf at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump and the \u2018advice of counsel\u2019 Trump complained Tuesday that Merchan was not allowing him to invoke the advice he claims he was given by lawyers.\u00a0Criminal defendants sometimes employ an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense\u00a0to try to demonstrate that they had not intended to break the law. \u201cHere, I\u2019m not even allowed to say \u2018advice of counsel.\u2019 This is a new one to me, \u2018advice of counsel,\u2019\u201d Trump told reporters outside the courtroom. \u201cWhen you have a lawyer and the lawyer does something or advises you on something, you say \u2018advice of counsel.\u2019 He said you\u2019re not allowed to say that.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is misleading. He failed to mention that the reason Merchan will not allow Trump\u2019s legal team to invoke \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d during the trial is that, when Trump was asked before the trial whether he would be using an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense,\u00a0his lawyers\u00a0told Merchan he would not. An \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense\u00a0typically requires the defendant to waive attorney-client privilege. Trump\u2019s lawyers told Merchan before the trial that instead of a \u201cformal\u201d defense of \u201cadvice of counsel,\u201d Trump wanted to use a different defense in which he would not waive attorney-client privilege but would\u00a0still\u00a0\u201celicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges in the Indictment.\u201d Merchan rejected this proposal. He\u00a0wrote in March:\u00a0\u201cTo allow said defense in this matter would effectively permit Defendant to invoke the very defense he has declared he will not rely upon, without the concomitant obligations that come with it. The result would undoubtedly be to confuse and mislead the jury. This Court can not endorse such a tactic.\u201d Therefore,\u00a0Merchan ruled, Trump could not invoke or even suggest a \u201cpresence of counsel\u201d defense in the trial. Biden and the case Trump continued to declare that Biden had orchestrated the case. He said upon leaving court on Tuesday: \u201cThey have me sitting here for a Biden trial. It\u2019s a Biden trial.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that Biden has had any role in launching or running Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0-\u00a0and Bragg is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_rfk-jr-mercury-poisoning-brain-parasite", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. experienced a series of health issues in recent years, including an abnormality that he said was caused by a worm that entered his brain and then died, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. In 2010, Kennedy, now 70, experienced severe memory loss and mental fog, he said in a deposition two years later. According to the Times, he consulted top neurologists familiar with the medical history of his uncle, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, who had died of brain cancer in 2009. A New York doctor, after reviewing a scan of his brain, told him that his health issues could be \u201ccaused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,\u201d Kennedy said in the 2012 deposition, which concerned a divorce from his second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy. Robert Kennedy said at the time that his earning power had been negatively affected by the cognitive issues, the Times reported. Around the same time, the Times said, he suffered from mercury poisoning, which can lead to neurological issues such as loss of peripheral vision, muscle weakness and issues with movement, hearing and speech, as well as memory loss. Kennedy told the paper he has recovered from the memory loss and brain fogginess and that the parasite did not require treatment. In addition, he has grappled for decades with atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, an irregular heartbeat. He told the Times it has been more than a decade since he experienced the condition and said he believes he no longer suffers from it. Kennedy\u2019s campaign declined to provide his medical records to the Times. In a statement to CNN, Stefanie Spear, a spokesperson for Kennedy\u2019s campaign, said he had \u201ctraveled extensively in Africa, South America and Asia\u201d as part of his work as an environmental advocate and said he contracted a parasite in one of those trips. \u201cThe issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health. Questioning Mr. Kennedy\u2019s health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,\u201d the campaign said, referring to the advanced ages of the 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump. In his first public comments after the report published, Kennedy in a social media post offered \u201cto eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate.\u201d \u201cI feel confident of the result even with a six-worm handicap,\u201d he joked. Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert and Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told CNN that it\u2019s difficult to fully review Kennedy\u2019s claim without looking at the scans. \u201cIt\u2019s an incomplete story,\u201d as he put it. But, speaking generally, Hotez said people with pork tapeworm infections in their brains \u2014 a condition known as neurocysticercosis \u2014 more commonly experience seizures and sometimes need to be on anti-seizure medication for a long time because when the worms die, they form a calcified cyst in the brain that can cause the brain to release inflammatory chemicals called cytokines. The connection to memory problems and dementia is under study, Hotez said. Those symptoms are also associated with mercury poisoning, and Kennedy told the Times that at the time he was diagnosed with that ailment, he was consuming high quantities of tuna and perch. \u201cYeah, the worms are not feeding the brain. They are living in the brain,\u201d Dr. Hotez said.\u00a0The worms get nutrients from the body, but they are not eating the brain tissue, he said. Pork tapeworm infections can be difficult to diagnose because when the worm is alive it masks itself from detection and doesn\u2019t show up on scans.\u00a0It\u2019s more common to find the worm after it has died and left behind a calcified cyst in the brain, Hotez said. Kennedy said he changed his lifestyle following these health episodes, including getting more sleep, traveling less, reducing his fish intake and undergoing chelation therapy that seeks to expel metals in the body. On the campaign trail, Kennedy has portrayed himself as vibrant and youthful compared to Biden and Trump, engaging in strenuous activities like skiing and weightlifting. Biden\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, said in February that there were \u201cno new concerns\u201d with the president\u2019s health revealed in a physical and the White House has said no cognitive test was administered as O\u2019Connor did not find it necessary. Trump\u2019s campaign late last year released a letter that made broad statements about his health \u2014 including claims that the former president is in \u201cexcellent\u201d health\u00a0and that his cognitive exams \u201cwere exceptional\u201d \u2014\u00a0but did not include information about the types of tests that Trump took or what the results were. Kennedy\u2019s views on personal health, including his long-held skepticism of certain vaccines, have been a distinctive feature of his public image. He has disputed suggestions that he is \u201canti-vaccine,\u201d though he is the founder of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, a group that has been accused of spreading falsehoods about vaccines.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_rfk-jr-parastic-worm-brain", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday detailed the medical abnormality he experienced in 2010 that he said was caused by a worm that entered his brain and then died, marking his first public explanation of the incident. Kennedy said he recalls experiencing \u201cbrain fog\u201d and \u201chaving trouble with word retrieval and short-term memory,\u201d during that period in a podcast interview on \u201cPushing the Limits with Brian Shapiro.\u201d He was initially told by doctors that he had a tumor in his brain, and was planning to have it removed before he met with another doctor who looked at images of his brain and said it didn\u2019t look like a tumor, Kennedy said. After the doctor measured the abnormality and determined that it hadn\u2019t grown, Kennedy continued, \u201cthey said that this is almost certainly a parasite that got into your brain \u2026 it\u2019s a parasite that\u2019s very common in India where I had done a lot of environmental work.\u201d According to the New York Times, which first reported the incident on Wednesday,\u00a0Kennedy had said during a 2012 deposition, which concerned a divorce from his second wife, that a doctor had told him his health issues could be \u201ccaused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.\u201d In a statement to CNN Wednesday, Stefanie Spear, a spokesperson for Kennedy\u2019s campaign, said he had \u201ctraveled extensively in Africa, South America and Asia\u201d as part of his work as an environmental advocate and said he contracted a parasite in one of those trips. \u201cThe issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health. Questioning Mr. Kennedy\u2019s health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,\u201d the campaign said, referring to the advanced ages of the 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump.

Kennedy on Wednesday also detailed his experience with a bout of mercury poisoning, which he\u00a0said occurred around the same time he was diagnosed with a parasite in his brain. Kennedy said tests showed his blood containing \u201csky high\u201d levels of mercury, and said he underwent chelation therapy to remove the metals from the body. \u201cAt the same time, I was having my mercury tested, and I was getting all kinds of tests, and my mercury test came back sky high. So, ten times what, you know, the EPA levels were for blood mercury, I think it was,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThey were over ten times what\u2013 what anybody considered safe. And I had that chelated out and all of that brain fog went away.\u201d Kennedy said he has made a full recovery from both health incidents. CNN\u2019s Michelle Shen contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_bidens-rafah-warning-is-turning-point-in-us-israel-relations-and-a-belated-but-inevitable-rupture-with-netanyahu", "text": "US-Israel relations have reached a critical crossroads that shows that even President Joe Biden\u2019s staunch support can reach its limits when it starts to conflict with wider American national security and moral interests \u2014 and his own dicey political position. Biden\u2019s warning in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that he\u2019d halt some weapons shipments to Israel if it invades the Gazan city of Rafah marks the most direct US attempt to rein in its ally in a national security crisis since the Reagan administration, and the first significant conditioning of American military assistance since the start of the war. Biden\u2019s statement of his ultimate red line takes his trial of strength with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to its most intense level yet and sent immediate shockwaves through US and Israeli politics and around the world. Washington fears a full-scale Israeli incursion into densely populated Rafah would cause civilian casualties on a level even greater than the 34,000 Palestinians the Gaza Health Ministry reports have already been killed in the Israeli war on Hamas. The city is already \u201changing on the edge of a precipice,\u201d a senior United Nations official told CNN Thursday. Hospitals are overstretched as Palestinians die in Israeli attacks on the suburbs and tens of thousands of people have already fled. The civilian carnage in the Gaza war has caused outrage globally and generated extreme pressure on Biden at home that threatens to splinter his Democratic coalition as he wages a neck-and-neck reelection campaign against Donald Trump. Republicans are already accusing the president of appeasing terrorists following his comments. Despite US concerns, Netanyahu\u2019s government says it has no choice but to finish its assault on Hamas, which embeds itself in civilian areas \u2014 including in Rafah \u2014 where key leaders are hunkered down in tunnels. For Netanyahu, the eradication of the group that carried out the October 7 attacks may be a matter of political survival. The major questions now after this tectonic shift in the US-Israel relationship are: \u2022 Will Biden\u2019s move affect Israel\u2019s decision-making as it stages air and ground operations in Rafah that could be seen as the precursor to a full offensive? \u2022 Can Israel \u2014 as Netanyahu vows \u2014 go ahead alone in an operation even the US has disowned? \u2022 Longer-term, will Biden\u2019s move be a temporary blip in his relations with the Jewish state\u2019s hard-right government or a full-scale rupture between Israel and the US? \u2022 How would a full-scale offensive in Rafah further hamper already faltering attempts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas? Would it rupture US hopes of a regional compact between Israel and Arab states? And could an operation that kills hundreds of civilians set the regional temperature boiling again and raise fresh fears of a regional war? \u2022 In the US, will Biden\u2019s belated attempt to impose direct pressure on Netanyahu over his defiance towards US concerns do anything to alleviate the president\u2019s vulnerable political stranding in his own party as Republicans pummel him with exaggerated claims that he\u2019s turning his back on Israel? Biden\u2019s comments send political reverberations around the world Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that the public estrangement between Biden and Netanyahu over Rafah represented one of the difficult moments ever in US-Israel relations. \u201cI do think this is a very low point \u2014 could the relationship survive this? Yes. Could it do so while Netanyahu is in power? No,\u201d Pinkas said. Initially, Biden\u2019s warning, delivered in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett in the swing state of Wisconsin on Wednesday, looks like a case of political whiplash. On Tuesday, during a speech memorializing the Holocaust, Biden said that his \u201ccommitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree.\u201d Yet a day later, the president seemed to be sending a contradictory message. The two statements however need to be considered together, and the key phrase is \u201ceven when we disagree.\u201d The president is apparently seeking to create political space where he can alleviate fierce electoral pressure within his party and internationally, satisfy moral aspirations to shield civilians, head off a wider Middle East war while also honoring his long-term commitment to Israeli security. But given the treacherous entanglement of the worst attack on Israel\u2019s security in decades and international and domestic politics, many of these goals may be irreconcilable. Biden\u2019s biggest break with Netanyahu is a moment that was always coming \u2014 even if it took months to arrive and was engineered reluctantly on the US president\u2019s part. The critical political interests of the US and Israeli leaders \u2014 both of whose hold on office is threatened by the war \u2014 are diverging. The president and top officials repeatedly warned his counterpart against a Rafah offensive. And his authority and credibility as a global leader depends on Biden standing behind his warnings after Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored US calls to temper the intensity of the Gaza war. Biden\u2019s statement also implies a judgement that US national interests now depend on not being seen as an accessory to the worsening of an already epochal humanitarian disaster in Gaza that has put the United States at odds with many allies in Europe and the Middle East and erode its pretension to global leadership. The president also has massive political problems. While the Israel-Gaza war is far from the top issue preoccupying American voters, the likely tight race with Trump means that the race could be decided by a few thousands votes in the pivotal swing states among tens of millions cast nationally. And the demographic groups most exercised by the civilian cost of the war and the plight of Palestinians are young, progressive and Arab Americans voters in Michigan \u2014 a state that could decide the election. These are exactly the people that the president can least afford to lose. Biden has already been called \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d at campaign events that are frequently interrupted by protests. The wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at college campuses are playing into Trump\u2019s claims that the US is beset by left-wing extremism and chaos that Biden can\u2019t control. And any mass protests at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August would conjure painful omens for Biden, even if the unrest and anti-Vietnam war fury around the same event in the same venue in 1968 that helped propel a Republican to the White House that year aren\u2019t an exact historical analogy. Israel\u2019s next move Israel\u2019s war cabinet was due to meet Thursday in a session that will offer members of Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition an opportunity to vent over Biden\u2019s decision. Militarily, and given its reserves of weaponry and ammunition, the government may have all the materiel that it needs to go into Rafah. Even so, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said Thursday that the US move could impair his country\u2019s moves to reach its objectives. Israel must also consider whether an invasion of Rafah absent US cover would further fracture the global sympathy it received after the October 7 terror attacks. Such a step could shatter already long-shot negotiations for a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of remaining Israeli hostages and its wider geopolitical aspirations. But Netanyahu\u2019s mindset has long been that the Hamas attacks represent an attempt to wipe Israel off the map and he sees an existential threat to Judaism, even if the rest of the world does not share his view. Israel has so far given no indication that it will change its plans. For instance, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned Thursday: \u201cI turn to Israel\u2019s enemies as well as to our best of friends and say \u2013 the state of Israel cannot be subdued, not the IDF, not the defense establishment.\u201d But if any large-scale invasion of Rafah creates the humanitarian catastrophe that the United States fears, Israel will be left on its own to take the heat after ignoring concerns of the administration and publicly and repeatedly dissing Biden. A GOP backlash reflects Netanyahu\u2019s politicking The immediate and angry reaction to Biden\u2019s comments to CNN from Republicans underscored Netanyahu\u2019s years of playing politics in Washington and his allying of his Likud Party with fellow travelers in the GOP. House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Biden on CNBC of defying the will of Congress by threatening to halt weapons shipments and of \u201ctrying to dictate \u2026 and micromanage the war, the defense effort in Israel, as a condition of supplying the weapons that we all know that they desperately need.\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, charged Biden in a Truth Social post of \u201ctaking the side of these terrorists, just like he has sided with the Radical Mobs taking over our college campuses, because his donors are funding them.\u201d As he arrived for another day of his hush money trial in New York, Trump added that any American Jews who voted for Biden should be ashamed, repeating a trope that is offensive to many in the community who have deep bonds with Israel but do not support Netanyahu\u2019s hardline government. The charge that Biden is harming Israeli security is tough to stand up, given his half century of support for the Jewish state and his forbearance of Netanyahu\u2019s frequent public rebukes and attempts to undermine him \u2014 and previous Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Washington. Just last month, Biden ordered a massive US and allied air operation to shield Israel from a wave of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles sent from Iran in response to its assassination of senior Iranian military intelligence officers in a diplomatic compound in Damascus. And Biden recently signed a multi-billion-dollar arms and ammunition package for Israel that he requested from Congress. Some observers are pointing to parallels between Republican President Ronald Reagan\u2019s delay of shipments of weapons and warplanes to Israel to protest its conduct of its war in Lebanon in the early 1980s. But that showdown took place at a time when US-Israeli relations were far less politicized in Israel or the United States and came with far less political harm to the former president than the current one. Among progressive Democrats, the initial reaction to Biden\u2019s move was positive but not effusive. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leader of the progressive movement, said that the threat of withholding arms was \u201can important step in the right direction by President Biden to halt the shipment of bombs to Israel.\u201d But the political consequences of the president\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war may be so profound that it could be too late to change them. For many voters, the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza is a searing moral issue that will not be erased by the president\u2019s belated pressure on Netanyahu. The crisis is one of the most intractable international political dramas to afflict any president in his reelection year in recent memory. And it hands Biden a set of unpalatable choices from which it will be almost impossible for him to emerge politically unscathed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/bidens-rafah-warning-is-turning-point-in-us-israel-relations-and-a-belated-but-inevitable-rupture-with-netanyahu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
