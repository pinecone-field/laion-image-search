{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_border-encounters-may", "text": "The number of people entering the US illegally has fallen sharply, with encounters at ports of entry falling by 25% since the White House announced controversial asylum restrictions earlier this month, according to new monthly statistics released Thursday by US Customs and Border Protection. The announcement is a welcome development for President Joe Biden, whose executive action on June 4 that shut off access to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally sought to address an ongoing crisis that has become a significant political challenge. According to CBP, encounters between ports of entry along the southwest border dropped to 117,900 recorded encounters in May, a 9% decrease from April. However, as CBP notes in a statement, \u201cmigration flows are dynamic.\u201d \u201cCBP continues to take strong enforcement efforts against transnational criminal organizations at our borders and beyond,\u201d CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller said in a\u00a0statement. \u201cOur enforcement efforts are continuing to reduce southwest border encounters. But the fact remains that our immigration system is not resourced for what we are seeing,\u201d Miller added. Earlier this month, the Biden administration invoked an authority to shut off access\u00a0to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally,\u00a0a significant attempt to address one of the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN. It was the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border and used the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. Biden\u2019s executive action followed an unsuccessful attempt by US lawmakers earlier this year to reach a bipartisan agreement that would have changed asylum laws and secured greater funding for agencies to vet migrants seeking asylum in the US. The deal ultimately failed after Trump and House Republicans raised objections.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/border-encounters-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_secret-service-rnc-security-perimeter", "text": "The US Secret Service on Friday laid out the security measures for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next month, including a perimeter that will prevent protesters from gathering at a large park near the venue. Pere Marquette Park \u2013 which is a few blocks from the Fiserv Forum, where the convention will be held \u2013 now falls under the \u201chard\u201d security perimeter, which will permit only credentialed attendees and volunteers and\u00a0will not allow weapons inside, Audrey Gibson-Cicchino, US Secret Service RNC coordinator,\u00a0said at a news conference. The park had been the subject of security\u00a0discussions\u00a0between the Secret Service and the RNC as recently as last week, with a Donald Trump campaign adviser praising the proposed expansion of the hard perimeter to include the\u00a0park,\u00a0CNN previously reported. The security plans\u00a0include two stages on\u00a0either side of the hard perimeter that will be reserved for protest speeches, said Nick DeSiato, chief of staff at the Milwaukee\u00a0mayor\u2019s office. Friday\u2019s announcement\u00a0comes\u00a0after a\u00a0monthslong dispute between the Secret Service and the GOP\u00a0over security measures around the convention, which will take place from July 15 to 18. The party had accused the agency of ignoring its concerns, while the Secret Service said Republicans were undermining efforts to keep the event safe. In April, Republican National Committee counsel Todd Steggerda\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0asking the Secret Service to keep protesters farther back from the convention\u00a0than what had been planned at the time. He wrote that the city\u2019s proposal \u201ccreates an elevated and untenable safety risk to the attending public\u201d and would place demonstrators in a one-block park that\u00a0\u201cwill\u00a0force thousands of peaceful attendees and demonstrators \u2026 to be in extremely close, consistent and unavoidable proximity.\u201d The RNC letter came during a peak in\u00a0pro-Palestinian rallies at major universities\u00a0across the US. The committee said in the letter that\u00a0\u201crecent\u00a0college and university campus clashes\u201d have shown that forced proximity causes heightened tensions and increases the risk of confrontations and law enforcement intervention. US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, responding to a question from CNN on Friday regarding recent comments from Trump ally Steve Bannon calling for\u00a0\u201cvictory or death\u201d\u00a0this election year, said the remark, as well as \u201ccomments that are made across the board,\u201d are considered but have not yet resulted in any changes to convention security. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s had a great impact at this point; we\u2019re still continuing forward with the plans as we\u2019ve designed them,\u201d Cheatle said.

Trump\u2019s attorneys said if Judge Arthur Engoron would not recuse from the case they are seeking an evidentiary hearing to delve into the judge\u2019s reported conversation with New York real estate lawyer Adam Bailey. In a\u00a0series of filings with the court on Thursday, Trump\u2019s attorneys\u00a0cite an interview Bailey gave to NBC New York the day the verdict was rendered, in which Bailey said, he \u201chad the ability to speak to [this Court] three weeks ago \u2026 I saw him in the corner [at the courthouse] and I told my client, \u2018I need to go.\u2019 And I walked over and we started talking \u2026 I wanted him to know what I think [about the case] and why \u2026 I really want him to get it right.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers say that is a reason why the judge should recuse himself from the case, which has since been appealed. The judge is still overseeing a monitor who he put in place to oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s finances. \u201cSpecifically, this Court has been publicly accused of engaging in prohibited communications regarding the merits of this case, in clear violation of the Code and this Court\u2019s solemn oath,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote, adding, \u201cWhere, as here, this Court\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned under the circumstances, it must recuse. Indeed, there is no other means of dispelling the shadow that now looms over this Court\u2019s impartiality, fairness, and ability to adhere to the Code.\u201d \u201cAccording to Mr. Bailey, this Court was an active participant in a conversation concerning the merits of the case, wherein this Court asked Mr. Bailey a \u2018lot of questions,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers, who also\u00a0subpoenaed the real estate lawyer, wrote. Bailey told CNN that he only spoke with Engoron about his September summary judgment decision \u201cbecause that\u2019s the only thing I discussed with reporters.\u201d Bailey said they \u201cwere discussing the law and how he got the law wrong,\u201d adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t even follow the trial.\u201d He went on to say he didn\u2019t think speaking with Engoron about his personal views on the judge\u2019s published decision \u201cwas wrong in any way.\u201d \u201cI was tricked, I was duped and I\u2019m devastated that any of this is happening, it\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Bailey said.\u00a0\u201cI am devastated and I am hurt that even though Judge Engoron is retiring very soon that he still has to deal with this, because of a statement I gave off-the-record.\u201d A\u00a0WNBC\u00a0spokesperson said\u00a0Thursday: \u201cWe stand by our story and our several months of reporting.\u201d Bailey declined to comment on whether he would move to quash the subpoena.

And then you have the champion of your league \u2014 these are the greatest fighters in the world \u2014 fight the champion of the migrants. I think the migrants\u2019 guy might win, that\u2019s how tough they are,\u201d the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said at a gathering of Christian conservatives in Washington. Trump added, \u201cHe didn\u2019t like that idea too much, but actually, it\u2019s not the worst idea I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d The former president repeated the comments at a campaign rally in Philadelphia later Saturday. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign swiftly denounced the comments Saturday afternoon. \u201cFitting that convicted felon Donald Trump spent his time at a religious conference threatening to round up Latinos, bragging about ripping away Americans\u2019 freedoms, and promising to be even more extreme if he regains power,\u201d spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said. \u201cTrump\u2019s incoherent, unhinged tirade showed voters in his own words that he is a threat to our freedoms and is too dangerous to be let anywhere near the White House again.\u201d The former president has repeatedly used dehumanizing and inflammatory rhetoric when referring to immigrants and has made stoking fears about undocumented immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border a central part of reelection campaign. He said at a campaign rally in Ohio in March that he thought some undocumented migrants were\u00a0\u201cnot people,\u201d and weeks later said he thought undocumented migrants who commit violent crimes are\u00a0\u201cnot humans\u201d and instead \u201canimals.\u201d Trump used language often employed by White supremacists and nativists when he claimed in an interview last year that undocumented immigrants were \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d The Biden campaign drew a link between the comments and Adolf Hitler, who wrote about the \u201ccontamination of the blood\u201d or \u201cblood poisoning\u201d in \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d The former president regularly claims without evidence that other countries are sending \u201cprisoners, murderers, drug dealers, mental patients and terrorists\u201d to the US. At his campaign rallies, he spotlights violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants as he bashes Biden\u2019s handling of security at the border. As president, Trump took steps to curb both illegal and legal immigration, targeting visa programs and seeking to restrict refugee resettlements. He also temporarily banned travel from seven Muslim-majority countries while in office. During his 2024 campaign, Trump has vowed to carry out the\u00a0\u201clargest domestic deportation operation in American history\u201d to combat what he claims is an \u201cinvasion of our country.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/trump-migrants-ufc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_bob-good-virginia-primary-trump-gop", "text": "It\u2019s a primary election that took an MRI of the modern Republican Party \u2014 revealing toxic backstabbing, desperate lunges for Donald Trump\u2019s favor and the former president\u2019s always festering sense of betrayal. And no one knows how it will end. Rep. Bob Good \u2013 an arch conservative whom Trump is trying to bump out of Congress for disloyalty \u2013 trails his GOP challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, by just over 340 votes after Tuesday\u2019s election in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District, with about 96% of votes in. The fate of Trump\u2019s quest for revenge could ironically partly hang on mail-in ballots \u2013 a category of votes the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has often decried with his false claims of 2020 election fraud. Trump is angry at Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, because he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential race. Kevin McCarthy also showed that Virginia is for vengeance by seeking his own bounty on Good, who helped to oust the California Republican as speaker last year. Good could become the first Republican incumbent to lose a House primary to a nonincumbent this year despite his frantic efforts to win back Trump\u2019s support, which included a trip to support the former president at his hush money trial in New York. McGuire told supporters Tuesday night, \u201cI\u2019m your Republican nominee,\u201d and thanked Trump for his help, even though the race could be heading for a recount if the margin between the two candidates remains so tight and the losing candidate requests one. Good said on social media that he\u2019d held off the \u201cWashington swamp\u201d and declared the race \u201ctoo close to call.\u201d CNN has not made a projection. Defeat for Good would strangle a fast-rising congressional career born when he won a drive-thru GOP convention in a Lynchburg church parking lot during the pandemic. The staunch conservative was elected to chair the powerful Freedom Caucus in only his second term. But he authored his own demise by getting crosswise with two key forces in the riotous Republican House majority \u2014 the ex-president and McCarthy, whose still potent financial machine is on a revenge tour. But the significance of the drama in this district \u2013 an area that produced presidents James Madison and James Monroe \u2013 goes far beyond a single, thwarted political arc. It shows that the real dividing line in the GOP is no longer a question of ideology. In more normal times, it would have been hard to imagine a conservative challenger getting to the right of Good. But in the modern GOP, the true acid test of political viability is total fealty to the presumptive nominee. And this race, which was the most expensive House GOP primary of the 2024 cycle so far, will also serve as the perfect emblem of a chaotic House majority that will be remembered far more for vicious internal fights and members trampling over one another to prove their devotion to Trump than for its legislative record. Trump\u2019s intervention The ex-president has plenty of weightier worries amid a staggering confluence of legal crises following his first criminal conviction and three other indictments and with a potential second presidency to plan. But he also has a sensitive political radar that picks out even the merest hint of disloyalty. It was therefore not surprising that Trump conducted a tele-rally for McGuire on primary eve and left his supporters with no doubt about who he favored and why. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. He was against things that everybody would have wanted and always made it difficult,\u201d Trump told supporters on the call. \u201cHe just let us down, he let us down very big. \u2026 As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years and then after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that\u2019s not good enough, because those are the people that \u2013 they tend to leave you very quickly.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to drive Good out of Congress sprung from the same reflex to exert power that he showed last week. In his first visit to Capitol Hill since his mob beat up police officers and smashed their way into the House and Senate on January 6, 2021, the ex-president gathered Republican lawmakers around him in a show of homage. The image of the day was a handshake offered by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn\u2019t hidden his disdain for the former president but who has never shirked from what needs to be done for the GOP to win and retain power. While he was estranged from Trump, Good campaigned as though he and the former president were on the same side. He used signs that said: \u201cTrump, Bob Good: Keeping America Great\u201d \u2013 as he appeared alongside the former president\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, himself a former Freedom Caucus chairman. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju in March, Good dismissed questions about his backing of DeSantis, whose primary bid ended in January after a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get with the present? This is a time to rally behind President Trump,\u201d Good said. \u201cMy opponent wants to continue to divide people based on the past. We\u2019re all behind President Trump. He must win. The country can\u2019t handle four more years of Joe Biden.\u201d The passport to power in Trump\u2019s GOP McGuire displayed the behavior required of anyone who wants a future in the Trump-era GOP in an interview with \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday just before polls opened in Virginia. He attacked Good for not being loyal to the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. \u201cObviously, he bagged Trump for an endorsement in 2022. And less than a year later, when the chips were down \u2026 he endorsed a different candidate.\u201d The retired Navy SEAL also upheld the former president\u2019s claims of election fraud in 2020 by arguing that Trump was doomed by changes to voting arrangements that were introduced during the Covid-19 emergency. \u201cI would say changing the rules in the middle of the game is cheating. And I think that that Trump was robbed,\u201d McGuire said. A new law allowing no-excuse absentee voting was passed by Virginia\u2019s legislature and approved by the governor in April 2020, seven months before the election. McGuire also voiced Trump\u2019s claims that the former president is a victim of a weaponized justice system following his conviction for falsifying business records to hide a payment to a former adult film star in 2016. Trump has made similar claims about his indictments over his attempt to overturn the election in 2020 and for alleged mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but I think all Americans, we go back to trust. You know, if we don\u2019t have trust in our institutions, our country is going to fall apart. And there is evidence everywhere of a two-tiered justice system. Rules for thee, not for me,\u201d McGuire said. The candidate\u2019s willingness to submit to the modern GOP\u2019s trifecta \u2014 unflinching loyalty to Trump and acceptance of his election fraud conspiracies and legal persecution narrative could yet see him emerge as the district\u2019s GOP nominee. Good could only manage two of the three \u2014 and it could cost him his career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/bob-good-virginia-primary-trump-gop/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_campaign-biden-trump-supreme-court-race-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is directly trying to exploit Donald Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in a significant new campaign gambit ahead of their pivotal debate clash next week. The Biden campaign on Monday debuted a new ad that will air in battleground states that blasts the presumptive Republican nominee as a felon who only cares about himself. The strategy appears to resolve a debate among Democrats about how overtly they should highlight the ex-president\u2019s legal woes in a neck and neck White House race. The new front in the 2024 campaign opened up after Trump sought to win votes among Black Americans, a traditional Democratic power base where the ex-president is\u00a0trying to make inroads\u00a0despite\u00a0his\u00a0tarnished\u00a0personal history\u00a0on\u00a0race. This comes as Republicans embrace their presumptive nominee despite his\u00a0conviction and bid to overturn the 2020 election result, going all in on Trump as they seek to win back the White House and the Senate and keep the House. Biden\u2019s new ad zeroes in directly on the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial and his huge loss in a civil fraud case to strike a sharp contrast with Biden\u2019s character.\u00a0As the ex-president\u2019s mug shot flashes on screen, a narrator says: \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who\u2019s only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The ad marks the Biden campaign\u2019s most explicit strategic use so far of Trump\u2019s legal woes in a campaign message. Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu explained the thinking on CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d: \u201cWhat this ad is about is about showing the American people about the issue that\u2019s going to decide this campaign: wisdom, courage, character.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign responded by blasting the hush money trial as \u201celection interference\u201d and highlighted polls showing the former president\u2019s strength in swing states. \u201cThe contrast between President Trump\u2019s strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson, wrote on X. Biden, who flew directly from his second trip to Europe within a week to a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday, argued there that one of the \u201cscariest\u201d parts of a second Trump term would be a possibility that his rival could appoint more hardline conservative Supreme Court justices. Former President Barack Obama, who joined his former vice president at the fundraiser, meanwhile bemoaned the fact that Republicans are set to nominate a candidate who was \u201cconvicted by a jury of his peers on 34 counts.\u201d Candidates position themselves for first presidential debate The campaign is intensifying ahead of 2024\u2019s first presidential debate, on CNN on June 27, a potentially defining moment of a campaign that could see an ex-president beat the sitting president who ousted him from office for only the second time in history. The showdown in Atlanta will take place with 81-year-old Biden under extreme pressure to show he\u2019s up to another four-year term amid pervasive voter concerns about his advanced years and following Trump\u2019s incessant mockery of the visibly aging president\u2019s mental acuity and physical state. The ex-president\u2019s constant ridiculing of Biden\u2019s faculties may, however, be lowering expectations for Biden\u2019s performance, raising the prospect that an energetic showing from the president could have a similar impact to his barnstorming State of the Union address this year, which temporarily quieted concerns over his age. The ex-president\u2019s volatile behavior in recent days, including after he marked his 78th birthday on Friday, is prompting the Biden campaign to argue that Trump\u2019s state of mind \u2014 as well as his attempt to crush American democracy four years ago \u2014\u00a0means he\u2019s unfit for a return to office. Last week, the campaign described Trump as \u201cmore unhinged than ever before\u201d after he returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since the January 6, 2021, mob attack to be embraced by House and Senate GOP lawmakers. The first presidential debate of this campaign is unusually early, meaning it could give the president a chance to jolt a toss-up White House race that has been largely stable for months. Trump is polling strongly in key swing states. Biden is apparently clinging to a narrowing path through the countrywide electoral map to the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. The president is being hampered by the pain felt by many Americans over high prices and elevated interest rates that have made it hard to afford new homes and car loans \u2014 giving Trump an opening to conjure nostalgia about the pre-pandemic economy during his term in office. CNN on Saturday announced new details for the debate, agreed to by both campaigns. The event will take place in a television studio rather than in front of a live audience. It will include two commercial breaks, during which campaign staff will be barred from interacting with their candidate. Both men agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their positions will be determined by a coin flip. Microphones will be muted except when it\u2019s a candidate\u2019s turn to speak. Biden is expected to head to Camp David later this week for an intense debate camp that will involve his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, who has been schooling Democratic candidates ahead of debates for decades. Trump held a policy forum with a group of advisers and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri when he was in Washington last week. His aides insisted that the ex-president would not necessarily engage in traditional debate prep but rely on interviews and rallies to hone his approach. However, Trump\u2019s interviews, mostly with conservative media, are often full of softball questions. And he skipped all the GOP primary debates, so he might not be fully prepared when Biden gets in his grille. Trump seeks to fracture Biden\u2019s support among Black voters In a race that will turn on a handful of swing states that could be decided by mere thousands of votes, any chunks either candidate can take from the other\u2019s core constituency could be crucial. This is why Trump spent Saturday in Michigan, seeking to take advantage of signs of waning enthusiasm for Biden among Black voters. The former president unveiled his \u201cBlack Americans for Trump\u201d coalition, which has the support of prominent Black Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. In a Friday interview with Semafor, Trump declared, \u201cI\u2019m not racist.\u201d He added: \u201cI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldn\u2019t be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,\u201d he said. Speaking at a predominately Black church in Detroit on Saturday, Trump falsely claimed that Black workers did far better in his first term than under Biden in an effort to leverage the cornerstone of his campaign \u2014 immigration \u2014 into an appeal to minorities he claims are losing their jobs to undocumented migrants. He is also highlighting Biden\u2019s role as a senator in passing a 1990s crime bill that resulted in high rates of incarceration among Black citizens. According to CNN exit polls in 2020, Trump won about 1 in 10 Black voters. But a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found the ex-president winning more than 20% of Black voters in battleground states. If he can depress Biden\u2019s advantage among the key demographic in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, Trump could improve his chances of winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, states that form Biden\u2019s best path to keep the White House. The Biden campaign hit back at Trump\u2019s appeal to a reliable core constituency that helped lift Biden to the presidency, highlighting controversies, including Trump\u2019s demand for the death penalty against five youths who were wrongly convicted of an assault and rape in Central Park in the 1980s and his racist campaign over Obama\u2019s birthplace. \u201cWe sure haven\u2019t forgotten Trump repeatedly cozying up to white supremacists and demonizing Black communities to his political benefit \u2014 because that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019ll do if he wins a second term,\u201d said Jasmine Harris, the director of Black media for the Biden campaign. Obama also took a shot at the presumptive GOP nominee when asked by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel at the Los Angeles fundraiser what he thought about Trump\u2019s claims that he\u2019d done more for Black people than any president in history. The former commander in chief replied: \u201cOne thing he did, for example, was make them feel even better about the first Black president.\u201d Biden slams \u2018out of kilter\u2019 Supreme Court majority Political fundraisers are often closed. But the Biden campaign seemed keen to show the president in an informal setting with Obama and stars including Julia Roberts and George Clooney. The president stopped in Washington only to refuel Air Force One on the way home from the G7 summit in Italy before the event, which came days after his surviving son, Hunter Biden, was found guilty on gun charges following a trial in Delaware. The president\u2019s campaign on Sunday released a video from the fundraiser in which Biden referenced the controversy surrounding flags raised by Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s wife that critics have warned are politically provocative. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019s going to appoint two more flying flags upside down,\u201d Biden said. Asked by Kimmel whether he considered this the scariest part of a second Trump term, Biden responded, \u201cIt is one of the scariest parts.\u201d The president added: \u201cThe Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today, I mean never.\u201d For years before the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, Republicans put the destiny of the nation\u2019s top court at the center of their presidential election campaigns. Biden gave the clearest indication yet this weekend that Democrats are now desperate to play on the same turf.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_supreme-court-guns-rahimi", "text": "The Supreme Court upheld a federal law Friday that bars guns for domestic abusers, rejecting an argument pressed by gun rights groups that the prohibition violated the Second Amendment. The 8-1 decision in one of the court\u2019s most closely watched cases limited the scope of a blockbuster ruling the justices handed down just two years ago that prompted a flood of legal challenges to other gun laws across the nation. The decision, which placed most of the court\u2019s conservatives and liberals on the same side, could help shore up similar federal gun regulations that have been challenged since the Supreme Court vastly expanded gun rights in 2022, at least in situations where a criminal defendant is considered dangerous. That court\u2019s 2022 ruling caused substantial confusion for lower court judges reviewing Second Amendment lawsuits. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said the court had \u201cno trouble\u201d coalescing around the idea that an individual who poses a threat can be denied access to weapons. \u201cOur tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others,\u201d Roberts wrote. The chief justice pushed back on the idea that its decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen had hemmed locked lower courts into striking down any gun law that didn\u2019t have a direct historic analogue. Roberts said that some lower courts had \u201cmisunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases.\u201d \u201cThe court\u2019s ruling today leaves intact a specific federal criminal prohibition on gun possession by those subject to domestic violence-related restraining orders,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cBut there are dozens of other federal and state gun regulations that have been challenged since the court\u2019s 2022 ruling in the Bruen case. The harder cases, like whether Congress can prohibit all felons, or all drug offenders, from possessing firearms, are still to come.\u201d Several of those cases are already pending at the Supreme Court and could be granted in coming days. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion in Bruen, authored a lone dissent on Friday. \u201cThe court and government do not point to a single historical law revoking a citizen\u2019s Second Amendment right based on possible interpersonal violence,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cYet, in the interest of ensuring the Government can regulate one subset of society, today\u2019s decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more.\u201d Challenge from Texas man arrested after series of shootings At issue in the case was a 1994 law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was convicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend\u2019s credit card was declined. Rahimi\u2019s lawyers claimed that the Supreme Court\u2019s blockbuster decision two years ago meant that the law on domestic violence orders could not be squared with the Constitution. A 6-3 majority in Bruen, in the opinion by Thomas, ruled that gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d The defense attorneys argued that the founding generation never responded to domestic violence by banning the possession of weapons and, because of that, the government couldn\u2019t do so now. The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals embraced that argument, concluding that a gun ban for people involved in domestic disputes was an \u201coutlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.\u201d But the Biden administration and domestic violence victims groups noted there were founding-era laws that prohibited dangerous Americans from possessing guns. In other words, they said, when viewed more generally, there were laws that could meet the court\u2019s new history-based test. Women who are subject to domestic abuse are five times more likely to die at the hands of their abuser if there is a gun in the home, victims groups told the Supreme Court. President Joe Biden applauded the decision Friday. \u201cAs a result of today\u2019s ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades,\u201d Biden said in a statement. Douglas Letter, chief legal office of the gun control group Brady, said that the decision was an \u201cimportant victory for gun violence and domestic violence prevention.\u201d Randy Kozuch, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, downplayed the significance of Friday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s narrow opinion offers no endorsement of red flag laws or of the dozens of other unconstitutional laws that the NRA is challenging across the country that burden the right of peaceable Americans to keep and bear arms,\u201d Kozuch said in a statement. \u201cThis\u00a0decision holds only that an individual who poses a clear threat of violence may be temporarily disarmed after a judicial finding of dangerousness.\u201d During oral arguments in November, a majority of the court appeared poised to uphold the law \u2013 but several conservative justices had signaled they might be willing to do so only on narrow grounds. That may be in part because a series of related legal challenges are already queued up for the court, including a question of whether non-violent felons can be denied access to firearms. One of the prohibitions in question has ties to President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was convicted on June 11 of violating a law that bars possession of a gun by a person who is an \u201cunlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance.\u201d Biden is expected to appeal. In one sense, by upholding the law, the decision was a win for prosecutors in that matter. But the majority also avoided weighing into a legal debate over whether other federal gun prohibitions \u2013 such as for non-violence felons \u2013 would also be upheld.  The 5th Circuit last year, in a separate case, ruled that the prohibition on drug users is unconstitutional. Domestic violence victims groups, gun control advocates express relief Gun-control advocates praised the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis is a huge victory for survivors and it WILL save lives,\u201d March for Our Lives posted on X. Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, said the case shouldn\u2019t have been heard by the high court in the first place and its decision to take it up \u201cshows just how extreme this court has become.\u201d Advocates for domestic violence survivors have pointed to\u00a0research\u00a0that shows the risk of homicide increases by 500% if a gun is present in a domestic violence situation. Amy S\u00e1nchez, CEO of the Battered Women\u2019s Justice Project, said in a statement that the group was \u201cencouraged by the court\u2019s decision. \u201cUpholding the restriction on firearm access for abusers ensures that these protective measures remain effective and that survivors are not placed at greater risk,\u201d she said. Ruth Glenn, the president of Survivor Justice Action, an organization that advocates for survivors of domestic violence, told CNN Friday that \u201ctoday\u2019s ruling only really solidifies that we have more work to do.\u201d \u201cWe need to strengthen protection orders and ensure that they\u2019re enforced as they should be across municipalities, states,\u201d Glenn, who is a survivor of domestic violence, explained. When asked if she was concerned about attempts in the future to challenge protections for domestic violence victims, Glenn said, \u201cWe must vote. From my perspective and the perspective of this organization, elections matter. The survivors block is strong.\u201d Advocates told CNN prior to Friday\u2019s ruling that even if the high court rules in favor of the federal law, it could possibly set up future challenges, especially in the post-Bruen landscape. Nel-Sylvia Guzman, the deputy director of Safe Sisters Circle, a nonprofit servicing victims of domestic violence, said proponents of gun rights have looked at the Bruen decision \u201cas a blanket pass for removing any restrictions to, you know, gun rights and gun holders.\u201d Alito absent from bench again Justice Samuel Alito was not present for a second day in row as the justices handed down opinions in the Supreme Court\u2019s courtroom. The court has not responded to questions about his absence. CNN\u2019s Owen Dahlkamp, Kaanita Iyer and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed to this report.

Trump\u00a0continued, \u201cTHIS MAY BE, IN FACT, THE FIRST MAJOR STEP IN THE REVIVAL OF RELIGION, WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED, IN OUR COUNTRY. BRING BACK TTC!!! MAGA2024.\u201d Trump has courted religious voters ahead of November\u2019s election, and Friday\u2019s post was made the day before he is set to speak to a gathering\u00a0of\u00a0Christian conservative voters in Washington, DC. The controversial new law, signed by\u00a0Gov. Jeff Landry on Wednesday,\u00a0mandates that a poster-size display of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be in every classroom at schools from kindergarten through the university level that receive state funding.

Opponents of the mandate point to the establishment clause of the US Constitution that says\u00a0Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d The\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation have said they plan to file a lawsuit to challenge the new law. Supporters of the mandate cite the 2022 US Supreme Court decision that gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The ruling in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District said the coach\u2019s prayers amounted to private speech protected by the First Amendment and could not be restricted by the school district and essentially\u00a0lowered the bar between church and state.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_appeals-court-aca-no-cost-preventive-care", "text": "A conservative appeals court on Friday reversed aspects of a ruling that would have blocked nationwide Affordable Care Act requirements that certain preventive services be covered by insurers at no cost, including several cancer screenings and a popular heart medication. However, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a trial judge\u2019s conclusions that some of the no-cost coverage mandates were unlawful because the federal task force that recommended what preventive services should be covered under the mandates violated the Constitution. The case centers on the recommendations for no-cost coverage mandates that have been issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force, as well as those issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and by the Health Resources and Services Administration. US District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Texas had previously struck down the recommendations issued by the US Preventive Services Task Force that were not already in place at the time the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, agreeing with the challengers\u2019 argument that the task force violated the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause. Had his ruling gone into effect nationwide, it would have invalidated the no-cost coverage mandates for some cancer screenings, the use of statins to prevent cardiovascular disease, and counseling referrals for pregnant and postpartum women at increased risk of depression, as well as for the HIV-prevention measures known as PrEP. (O\u2019Connor also stuck down the PrEP mandate on the claim that it violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.) With its new ruling, the 5th Circuit \u2013 which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi \u2013 set a precedent that will control for any other case brought in those states where the challengers are also seeking exemption from the mandates under the same appointments clause claim. That means that although the 5th Circuit significantly narrowed the scope of the current case, it could still have a major impact on the law\u2019s reach for millions of Americans. Friday\u2019s ruling also sets up what could be the next Supreme Court clash over the Affordable Care Act, which has been under relentless legal attack by the right since it was enacted in 2010. The Justice Department declined to comment. The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. A lawyer for the challengers also has not offered comment on the case. The 5th Circuit sent parts of the case back to the lower court for more proceedings concerning the constitutionality of the other two entitles targeted in the lawsuit, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and by the Health Resources and Services Administration \u2013 which, respectively, issue recommendations for no-cost vaccine coverage and for preventive services for women and children. In its Friday ruling, the 5th Circuit said it was inappropriate for the trial judge to issue the sweeping order \u2013 which had already been paused for appeal \u2013 that would have halted for the entire country some of the mandates from the task force, given that the individuals and businesses that brought the lawsuit were already being shielded any from enforcement action being brought against them under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cAlthough all the services remain nationwide, the battle is far from over.

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-jobs-biden-immigration", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, who has promised to conduct mass deportations if he is elected to a second term in November, continued his angry rhetoric about illegal immigration at a campaign rally in Nevada in early June. \u201cVirtually 100% of the new jobs under Biden have also gone to illegal aliens,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim\u00a0that nearly all the new jobs under Biden have gone to immigrants, whether or not they are allowed to legally work in the US\u00a0is false. The number of US-born workers increased about 3.5% between May 2021, just after Biden took office, and last month, though it did decline 0.2% over the past year,\u00a0according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u00a0 It\u2019s true that the number of foreign-born workers has increased at a much faster rate \u2013 20% \u2013 than the rate for native-born workers during Biden\u2019s presidency, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the native-born are not getting jobs. Also, many economists credit the influx of immigrant workers as a main reason the US labor market has remained strong, and the unemployment rates for both\u00a0immigrants and US-born workers remain low by historical standards. First, two caveats: We don\u2019t know how Trump is defining illegal aliens, specifically whether he\u2019s including people who may have entered the country illegally but now have work permits. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on foreign-born workers, which it defines as people who were born outside the US and neither of whose parents was a US citizen. The category covers legally-admitted immigrants including those who have become naturalized citizens, undocumented immigrants, refugees and temporary residents such as students and temporary workers, but the data doesn\u2019t specify the groups into which people fall. Getting back to the claim: One of the major themes of Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns has been that undocumented immigrants are destroying America. Here\u2019s what the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show: Some 130.4 million native-born people were employed in May. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 4.5 million since May 2021, shortly after Biden took office, though it\u2019s down nearly 300,000 from May 2023. (The data is not seasonally adjusted, so we must look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, about 123 million native-born people were employed.) Roughly 30.9 million foreign-born people held jobs in May, up 5.1 million from May 2021 and 637,000 since May 2023. (In January 2021, 25.3 million of the foreign-born were employed.) There is no comprehensive data on how many immigrants without work permits are employed, but economists at Standard Chartered Bank in May looked into what share of the recent job growth went to immigrants such as asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees and refugees who received authorization to work legally in the US. While none of these groups are working illegally in the US, as Trump referenced in his speech, the analysis provides useful insight into how many jobs these immigrants may have landed in recent years. Standard Chartered estimated that about half the jobs added in fiscal year 2024, which began October 1, went to these immigrants. On average, more than 170,000 of these immigrants a month received initial employment authorization documents from US Citizenship and Immigration Services in the current fiscal year, according to Standard Chartered\u2019s analysis. On average, about 64% of the foreign-born population are working, so that would translate into about 109,000 asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees and refugees finding jobs each month. The economy has added about 230,000 jobs a month this fiscal year, so these immigrant workers would account for just under half of that growth, according to the analysis, which was conducted by Steve Englander, head of North American Macro Strategy, and Dan Pan, economist, at Standard Chartered Bank. In fiscal year 2023, these immigrants likely held more than 800,000 of the 3.1 million jobs added, or more than 25%, the analysis estimated. Recent surges of immigration account for the increase in the share of immigrant workers\u00a0in the current fiscal year, the analysts said. The analysts note that they could be underestimating the number of such immigrants that landed jobs because they are often \u201cheavily motivated\u201d to work since they have limited access to public benefits. Trump could have fairly said, as some right-leaning commentators have suggested, that the number of native-born workers has declined in the past year, while the number of foreign-born workers has increased. But that\u2019s not true when looking over Biden\u2019s entire term in office. Moreover, some economists say it\u2019s better to look at the share of people working, rather than the number, because the former takes into account population and demographic changes, such as Baby Boomers aging out of the labor force. Some 59.3% of the native born were working last month, compared to 57.7% in May 2021, and some 64% of the foreign born had jobs last month, compared to 60.2% in May 2021. The economy was still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic shock early in Biden\u2019s term. Both groups had even lower rates of employment in January 2021. Still, the share of employed foreign-born men has been higher than the share of working native-born men since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 2007. Overall, the share of men who are working has been declining for decades \u2013 a trend that has puzzled labor economists and led to many theories as to the causes, such as the decline in factory jobs, increases in technology and globalization and the rise in the number of men with criminal convictions. All these can make it more difficult for men, particularly those with fewer skills or less education, to find work. \u201cForeign-born men come to this country, and they want to work,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen declining labor force participation rates among native-born men for decades.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-jobs-biden-immigration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history", "text": "Former President Donald Trump made\u00a0more than two dozen false claims\u00a0at his Tuesday campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin, including two significant attempts to rewrite Wisconsin history. The\u00a0first\u00a0was a slightly vaguer than usual version of his\u00a0familiar\u00a0lie that he won Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. He lost the state\u00a0by\u00a020,682\u00a0votes. The second was a version of a false claim Trump\u00a0delivered\u00a0in 2020 and again in 2022: his\u00a0assertion\u00a0that he had saved the Wisconsin city of Kenosha from destruction in 2020 when Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, refused to take action to deal with the civil unrest that followed the police shooting of a Black man. \u201cBy the way, you know, Kenosha: I saved Kenosha, do you know that? When I was president. Right? Right? I saved it,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cKenosha was \u2014 Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes and the governor wouldn\u2019t move, he just wouldn\u2019t move, and I moved. You know, I\u2019m not supposed to; it\u2019s supposed to be the governor, is supposed to do it, the mayor and the governor.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that Evers \u201cwouldn\u2019t move\u201d and that Trump was the person who \u201csaved Kenosha\u201d are false, as numerous fact-checkers\u00a0pointed out\u00a0when he made similar claims\u00a0in\u00a02020. Evers, not Trump, deployed the Wisconsin National Guard during the rioting in Kenosha \u2014 and Evers first deployed the\u00a0Guard the day before Trump publicly demanded that Evers do so. In other words, Trump insisted that Evers do something that he was already doing. Trump has repeatedly made a near-identical false claim about another state, Minnesota, that had a Democratic governor and civil unrest in 2020. Though Trump has asserted that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis over the objection of Gov. Tim Walz,\u00a0it was Walz who deployed the\u00a0Guard to Minneapolis hours before Trump demanded that he do so. The 2020\u00a0unrest in Kenosha, which involved both peaceful protests and acts of violence and vandalism, followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake by a White police officer who was\u00a0responding to a domestic disturbance call on August 23, 2020. (State and federal law enforcement later\u00a0decided\u00a0not to file charges against the officer.) On Tuesday, after Trump repeated his false claim, the governor\u2019s office provided CNN with the same\u00a0timeline it had sent to reporters when Trump had made the claim in 2020. The timeline, which is corroborated by public evidence, conclusively debunks Trump\u2019s narrative. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on the night of August 25, 2020, that the\u00a0\u201cgovernor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin.\u201d But the governor had already done so by then.\u00a0Evers authorized the deployment of 125 Wisconsin National Guard troops\u00a0just after 3 a.m.\u00a0the\u00a0day prior to the tweet, then\u00a0doubled\u00a0the deployment to 250 troops on the afternoon of the tweet \u2013 more than four hours before Trump weighed in. Evers continued to deploy more Wisconsin National Guard troops in the coming days, and he also\u00a0accepted\u00a0National Guard troops from three other states; they were never federalized. Evers did accept limited federal assistance from the\u00a0US Marshals Service\u00a0and the FBI, his office said, but that\u2019s no basis for Trump\u2019s claims that he saved the city when Evers wouldn\u2019t. The idea that the city\u2019s very existence was ever threatened is also\u00a0questionable, but we\u2019ll leave that aside here. Other Trump false claims Trump made lots of other false claims during the Racine rally. Here\u2019s a quick fact check on 12 of them: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cthe world was at peace\u201d when he was president in 2020, though there\u00a0were\u00a0numerous ongoing armed conflicts. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Democrats rigged the 2020 election, which did not happen. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0people\u2019s votes \u201ctend to disappear\u201d after they are cast, which is just not true. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0the country is \u201cin the middle of the worst crime wave in modern history,\u201d though preliminary statistics show crime\u00a0declined sharply in 2023 and the\u00a0first quarter of 2024. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he has been indicted more times than notorious gangster Al Capone, who was\u00a0indicted at least six times to Trump\u2019s four. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0somebody left cocaine at the White House \u201cabout a month ago,\u201d though that\u00a0happened about 11 months ago, and\u00a0said\u00a0it was \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine,\u201d though photos show the cocaine was in a\u00a0small bag\u00a0worth nothing even remotely close to that amount. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he went to Washington, DC, the other day for one of his trials, though the trip\u00a0was actually for meetings with congressional Republicans. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down his offer of 10,000 soldiers at the Capitol January 6, 2021; there is\u00a0no evidence she ever received such an offer, and she wouldn\u2019t have had the power to reject it if she did. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0no previous president had taken even 10 cents \u201cout of China\u201d from tariffs; the US\u00a0has had tariffs on China since the 1700s\u00a0and generated billions per year from them under predecessor President Barack Obama \u2014 and study after study has shown that Americans pay the tariffs, not China. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Syria and Turkey have been fighting over their border \u201cfor 2,000 years,\u201d though\u00a0historians have said this is nonsense:\u00a0Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire, and the modern border between them is less than 100 years old. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he thinks cumulative inflation under Biden is \u201c40 or 50 percent\u201d; it\u2019s\u00a0actually about 19%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl", "text": "When people ask me how good of a player Willie Mays was, I give them a perhaps odd answer. The San Francisco Giants basically gave Mays to the New York Mets for practically nothing in 1972, and a well past his prime 41-year-old Mays was the best overall hitter \u2013 as measured by his ability to get on base and hit for power \u2013 on that solid Mets squad. Of course, the more normal way to know how good Mays was is that he remains, statistically, the best player who played his entire career in the last century and is in the Hall of Fame. But if you truly want to know how great Mays was? You had to watch him play. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of my Father when I learned of Mays\u2019 passing last night on \u201cThe Source.\u201d I mentioned him almost immediately. You see, my Father watched Mays play when he came up as a rookie for the New York Giants in 1951. He considered Mays the best player he ever saw from the moment he laid eyes on him in that inaugural year. Mays supercharged that \u201851 Giants squad and helped them overcome a 13.5-game deficit in mid-August to win the NL pennant over their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, thanks to the Shot Heard \u2018Round the World. It remains, in my opinion, the greatest comeback in baseball history. Mays won Rookie of the Year that season. It was three years later, however, when Mays became a baseball legend. After serving in the military for over a season, the man nicknamed the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d \u2013 who had a great song written about him playing on that name \u2013 dominated the National League. He led the league in batting average, slugging percentage (a measure of power), triples (one of the ultimate measures of speed and power) and on-base plus slugging (OBPS), which combines all of it into one metric. And yet, I don\u2019t think most remember Mays\u2019 1954 MVP season for his offensive exploits; people like my Father remember him for a play he made during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. Let me set the scene: the game is tied 2-2 in the eighth inning. The Cleveland Indians have runners on first and second with no one out. Cleveland power hitter Vic Wertz is at the plate, and he hits a long fly ball into the truly cavernous center field at the Polo Grounds in New York. Mays, who roamed center field for over 20 seasons, went back more than 400 feet and made a difficult, over-the-shoulder catch seem easy. He then fired the ball back into the infield to ensure that no runs would score. The Giants would go on to win the game and sweep the series in four games. It was their swan song in New York, as they moved to the West Coast after the 1957 season. Mays never understood why people thought that catch was amazing. For him, it was relatively routine. What was unique about this catch, beyond being in the World Series, was that video cameras captured it in an era from which we don\u2019t have many recordings. That short splice of film is our version of getting to see Mays play. It\u2019s our rare glimpse into a man whose defensive prowess was far more than that one catch. Mays was the best defensive player at any position that entire season in the National League, according to advanced statistics. He is, by those same metrics, a top-five defensive outfielder of all time, and those statistics \u2013 given we don\u2019t have a lot of video from the era \u2013 don\u2019t even really take into account his obviously great arm. The fact that I\u2019m talking about the defense of a man who for a long period of time was third all-time in home runs \u2013 and remains sixth \u2013 tells you everything you need to know. Mays wasn\u2019t just defense, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about hitting for power, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just hitting for average, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about speed, even though he excelled at that and led the league in stolen bases four times. Mays was everything \u2013 and he was so for over 20 years. Mays was, as my friend and esteemed sports columnist Neil Paine calculated, the most complete ballplayer in history. Baseball fans talk about finding five-tool players \u2013 those who hit for power and average, have speed and defensive abilities in terms of range and arm \u2013 like a miner trying to find gold. Well, we found our gold in Mays. But again, Mays is more than just numbers. He was one of our last links to multiple eras of baseball history. Mays oversaw the expansion of baseball to the West Coast in 1958, when it had previously been played on the Major League level only east of the Mississippi River. He was the first superstar on the West Coast. Mays was also the last superstar with us who made his name playing in New York during the 1950s. It was baseball\u2019s golden era; a time when America came out of World War II with a booming economy and during which baseball continued to outrank football as America\u2019s favorite sport and pastime. And if Mays wasn\u2019t good enough, he actually added a few hits to his storied, record-book career a few weeks ago when Negro League statistics were integrated into the MLB record books. Mays was one of the last living stars who started his career in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for Birmingham Black Barons. I like to joke that Mays was so great that he was still compiling hits at the age of 93. Indeed, he remained a hit with anyone who saw him play. Long after his career was over, Mays \u2013 when he would come back to New York \u2013 lived down the street from us in the Bronx. My Father would see him on walks and knew he had to get his autograph. Mays gave my Dad that autograph, and he kept it in his office until he passed. Mays is a big reason why my Father was one of the few people who wore a New York Giants baseball cap throughout his later years. I bought at least three of them for my Dad because he had one on his head all the time and literally wore them out. It\u2019s a connection I try to carry on to this day whether it\u2019s by wearing a New York Giants baseball hat on television or by answering \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d when asked what baseball team I root for. Now, excuse me as I go try and find that Mays autograph to honor the greatest player anyone I know saw play.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_trump-faith-and-freedom-philadelphia-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, in keeping with his preference for shunning traditional debate prep, spent his last Saturday before his first one-on-one showdown with President Joe Biden on the campaign trail. Trump addressed a gathering of Christian conservatives Saturday afternoon in Washington, DC, touching upon his familiar campaign messages while emphasizing his efforts to undo the federal right to an abortion by nominating the justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. Later Saturday, he traveled to Philadelphia for a more traditional campaign rally in a key battleground state. The back-to-back public appearances stand in stark contrast to Biden\u2019s approach to the first of two presidential debates, hosted by CNN on Thursday. The president and his team are spending the weekend before the debate at Camp David, poring over briefing binders and holding mock debate sessions as he crams for his high-stakes meeting with Trump. While Trump has held informal briefing sessions with advisers and allies, he has also kept up an active campaign schedule. He held a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, on Tuesday and attended a fundraiser Thursday night in Ohio. Trump\u2019s campaign is relishing the juxtaposition of the two candidates\u2019 preparation styles. \u201cWhile Joe Biden\u2019s advisors force him to hide away at Camp David for some much-needed rest, President Trump is keeping up with his busy campaign schedule,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Speaking to reporters at a Philadelphia sandwich shop Saturday, Trump said, \u201cI look forward to Thursday. I know he\u2019s locked up in a log cabin someplace. You can imagine what he\u2019s doing,\u201d referring to Biden. Earlier Saturday, the former president attended the annual \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d conference hosted by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group founded by leading evangelical voice Ralph Reed. Trump has addressed the conference nine times over the years, though his appearance Saturday came as he has tried to distance himself from the strident anti-abortion positions of Christian groups \u2013 like Faith & Freedom. After arguing for a federal abortion ban and leading the charge to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump now says future fights over access to the procedure should be left to the states. His reversal on abortion comes after Trump blamed the issue for the GOP\u2019s underwhelming midterm performance in 2022 and before his party will vote on its first platform since the fall of Roe at its convention next month. Reed told CNN he doesn\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s position is at odds with faith voters. \u201cThe president\u2019s position simply reflects the short-term political reality for both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither side has the votes to pass federal legislation that reflects their values and aspirations.\u201d Reed added: \u201cThe long-term political reality is whoever wins that battle at the state level will build the momentum and gain the votes to achieve what they want at the federal level.\u201d Democrats have campaigned aggressively and spent millions of dollars reminding voters of Trump\u2019s role in eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. The Biden campaign slammed Trump\u2019s appearance at the Washington\u00a0event as proof of where he stands on the issue. \u201cYou are the company you keep,\u201d Biden campaign spokeswoman Sarafina Chitika said, \u201cand Donald Trump\u2019s position is clear: he \u2018proudly\u2019 worked alongside extremists to overturn Roe, he promised to work \u2018side by side\u2019 with a group promising to \u2018eradicate\u2019 abortion, and this Saturday, he\u2019ll deliver the keynote address to fellow extremists committed to banning abortion nationwide.\u201d Trump\u2019s rally in Philadelphia on Saturday evening marked his fourth appearance in Pennsylvania this year as the race for one of the top battlegrounds heats up. The Trump campaign has sought to drive a wedge between Biden and his birth state by hammering the president over inflation and crime. Trump homed in on crime in his remarks Saturday, saying Philadelphia was being \u201cravaged by bloodshed\u201d and highlighting the attendance of family members of slain Maryland mother Rachel Morin, whose suspected killer authorities say illegally crossed the US-Mexico border last year. Southeast Pennsylvania has become a hotbed of activity from both presidential campaigns. Trump held a rally in Lehigh Valley in April, and in February, he released a gym shoe at SneakerCon in Philadelphia as part of his outreach to minority communities. Biden won 92% of Black voters in Pennsylvania four years ago en route to capturing the state \u2013 key to his overall victory. But a recent poll from the The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College found his support in the state among Black voters had fallen to 50%. Ahead of Trump\u2019s Saturday rally, the Democratic National Committee unveiled new ads it said were aimed at highlighting \u201cTrump\u2019s history of failing Black Americans and how he\u2019s left the Black community behind.\u201d The counter-messaging push comes as polls show that Black men are more open to supporting the Republican nominee in this year\u2019s election than they have historically been. Along with a billboard in Philadelphia, the DNC planned to deploy at the former president\u2019s rally a mobile billboard that highlighted the higher unemployment rates for Black Americans under the Trump administration compared with the Biden administration. The committee planned \u201cpro-Biden kiosks\u201d around Temple University, where Trump\u2019s rally was held, that highlighted the student loan debt relief and increase in public education funding delivered under the Biden administration. \u201cDonald Trump was a disaster for minority communities \u2013 particularly Black Americans. He says he\u2019s not racist, but his record says differently. Over and over again, he has insulted cities with significant Black communities, and during his time in office, jobs disappeared, unemployment more than doubled for Black Americans during the pandemic, and his tax scam widened the racial wealth gap,\u201d DNC spokesperson Abhi Rahman said in a statement. Trump, meanwhile, pledged at the rally to \u201cwork to lift up Black, Hispanic and other communities in Philadelphia and all across the United States.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_trump-gag-order", "text": "Manhattan prosecutors are urging the judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money case to keep the gag order that stops the former president from making statements about jurors, prosecutors and their family members in place, arguing threats against prosecutors have increased since the start of the trial. Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said in a new court filing that they do not oppose lifting the portion of the gag order that blocked Trump from making statements about witnesses, but they suggest they could prosecute Trump if his conduct is illegal under harassment or other laws. \u201cThis change of circumstance does not mean that defendant has carte blanche to resume his reprehensible practice of publicly attacking individuals involved in litigation against him. But protections against such attacks will now derive from separate criminal-law protections against harassment or similar misconduct,\u201d they wrote. Trump\u2019s attorneys asked Judge Juan Merchan to lift the gag order now that the trial is over. Last month, Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. Prosecutors argued the gag order itself is narrow and does not prevent Trump from discussing the case \u2014 even at the first presidential debate set for June 27 on CNN. \u201cThe relevant question is not whether the orders prevent defendant from speaking freely about this case \u2014 they never have \u2014 but instead whether there is reason to preserve the orders\u2019 narrowly tailored protections on specific participants in this criminal proceeding,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Trump\u2019s lawyers told the judge that he would refrain from making statements about jurors, but prosecutors challenged that, writing, \u201cThere is good reason to question whether, absent judicial oversight, defendant will adhere to his counsel\u2019s representation that he will not attack the jurors in this case.\u201d Restricting Trump\u2019s comments on prosecutors, they argued, is still necessary and may continue to be after his sentencing since Trump said he will appeal the verdict. Prosecutors, citing an affidavit from NYPD Sgt. Nicholas Pistilli, said that in 2024, the department\u2019s threat unit identified 61 threats against District Attorney Alvin Bragg, his family and staff, with 25 of them coming in April, when the trial started, 24 in May, and seven in June. In addition, they wrote, the office has received nearly 500 threatening emails and phone calls since April 2024. \u201cThe justification for this provision may well continue after sentencing because the counsel and staff members of the District Attorney\u2019s Office who participated in this trial will continue to be engaged in any appeal, along with additional appellate staff; and this criminal proceeding will continue through the appeal that defendant has already announced he intends to pursue.\u201d This story has been updated with additional background information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/trump-gag-order/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_depape-verdict-guilty-state-charges", "text": "David\u00a0DePape, the man convicted in federal court for violently attacking House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, has been convicted of five\u00a0charges in state court. A California jury found\u00a0DePape\u00a0guilty\u00a0of\u00a0first-degree burglary, false imprisonment, threatening a family member of a public official, aggravated kidnapping and preventing or dissuading a witness by force or threat. The verdict comes as DePape already faces a 30-year sentence from his conviction last year in connection with the October 2022 attack. In court, DePape showed no visible reaction as the verdict was read, and his lawyer later said they intend to appeal the case. He is facing a sen\ufefftence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said at a news conference Friday. Before the trial, Judge Harry M. Dorfman dismissed three of the charges\u00a0DePape\u00a0was facing, including attempted murder, assault of an elder and assault with a deadly weapon, because DePape\u2019s\u00a0defense team argued that would amount to double jeopardy.\u00a0DePape\u00a0was convicted in federal court last November for assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and attempted kidnapping of a federal official in connection with the attack. Defense\u00a0attorney Adam Lipson said\u00a0DePape was\u00a0disappointed with the Friday\u00a0verdict,\u00a0which the jury deliberated for nearly 12 hours over three days. \u201cHe\u2019s lived a very isolated and lonely life when he kind of just got wrapped up in lot of conspiracy theory-type situations,\u201d Lipson said.\u00a0\u201cAnd, you know, he has some mental illness too, so he\u2019s just dealing with that right now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate he was charged this way. It was sort of a textbook vindictive prosecution,\u201d Lipson said. Jenkins said at the news conference that her office charged DePape \u201cwith what he was guilty of,\u201d and the jury agreed \u201cas clear by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d \u201cSo there is no need for any accusations of vindictive prosecution,\u201d Jenkins told reporters. \u201cWe are simply trying to do our jobs to make sure he was held accountable for every act that occurred that night that was criminal.\u201d Aaron Bennett, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement Friday that the family is \u201cgrateful for the kind thoughts and prayers they continue to receive,\u201d adding, \u201cSpeaker Pelosi and her family will refrain from further substantive comment until sentencing is complete.\u201d A sentencing hearing has not yet been scheduled. Federal prosecutors claimed last year that DePape broke into the Pelosis\u2019 home with \u201ca violent plan to kidnap Nancy Pelosi\u201d and \u201cto hold her hostage.\u201d While DePape\u2019s attorney at the time conceded that DePape had attacked Paul Pelosi, she argued that his motivation for the assault did not match the federal charges against him. DePape\u00a0testified in his own defense\u00a0at the trial, telling the jury that he had been looking for Nancy Pelosi and that her husband was not on his list of targets. He was \u201csurprised and confused,\u201d he said, when he found out the congresswoman was not home. \u201cI\u2019m telling him, \u2018I have other targets, but if you stop me, I\u2019ll go through you,\u2019\u201d DePape said, recounting a conversation with Paul Pelosi. \u201cI reacted. I hit him in the head,\u201d he continued, \u201cI reacted because my plan was basically ruined.\u201d The morning before the jury in the state case started deliberating, Gypsy Taub, DePape\u2019s ex-wife, was escorted out of the courtroom. She was ordered excluded from the courtroom and the second floor of the courthouse for the remainder of the trial after a judge said she attempted to tamper with members of the jury. According to the AP, on Tuesday, graffiti from a website Taub runs that promotes conspiracy theories was discovered in a women\u2019s bathroom near the courtroom.\u00a0CNN observed her outside the courtroom on Monday handing out pieces of paper with a\u00a0website address\u00a0that also promoted conspiracy theories.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_us-resumes-aid-delivery-into-gaza", "text": "The US restarted delivering aid into Gaza using its temporary pier on Thursday, according to US Central Command. The US dismantled the pier temporarily on June 14 for the second time since the pier was originally anchored on May 17. The pier was dismantled to avoid damages due to the anticipation of heavy seas, CENTOM said. As CNN reported earlier, the pier was reattached on Wednesday. The assistance delivered on Thursday included 1.4 million pounds of aid, the largest single-day delivery of aid to date, according to CENTCOM. Crucially, though, the aid being delivered across the pier is not yet being distributed inside Gaza. The distribution partner, the UN World Food Programme, paused distribution\u00a0pending a comprehensive security review following\u00a0an Israeli military operation to recover four hostage that killed scores of Palestinians. Rumors circulated about the use of the humanitarian pier for the military operation \u2013 which have been thoroughly denied \u2013 but the perception around its use increased the already stark risks to the humanitarian workers. The United Nations has laid out to the COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for aid in Gaza, a series of risk mitigation steps that must be taken before they assess it is safe to resume operations, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. One of the sources said those steps were laid out to COGAT in a letter this week. The other said there were intensive efforts underway to see the conditions, which they did not detail, are met. \u201cA thorough security assessment is being conducted by our Department of Safety and Security to ensure the safety of UN staff and partners. If that assessment can conclude that the UN can resume operations, then\u00a0the World Food Programme stands ready to do so based on its core humanitarian principles,\u201d UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Thursday. \u201cThe basic problem is one of a\u00a0lack of public order and that is creating a situation on the ground that is very difficult for the provision of aid.\u201d World Food Programme chief Cindy McCain said on Thursday\u00a0that they were awaiting clearance from the UN\u2019s Department of Safety and Security to resume operations on the pier. \u201cWe have not gotten that clearance from them yet, so I\u2019m guessing that they\u2019re still in discussions with the Israelis on this. Our hands are bound right now, because we simply can\u2019t go in. But let\u2019s be very clear: We are ready, we are able, and we can operate at full scale when we get the go-ahead, but I\u2019ve got to keep our people safe,\u201d she said in an interview with al-Monitor. To date, more than 9.1 million pounds of humanitarian aid have been delivered from the pier to the marshaling area where it can be collected by humanitarian organizations for onward delivery, the command said. The first time the pier was reattached to the beach was after it was damaged in heavy seas. The damage to the pier was a\u00a0major blow\u00a0to the American-led effort to create a maritime corridor for humanitarian supplies into the war-torn enclave. The\u00a0pier is the result\u00a0of months of work by US officials trying to come up with a way to get aid into Gaza in addition to dropping it out of planes or trucking it through border checkpoints. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore\u00a0(JLOTS),\u00a0requires very good sea conditions to operate. The US\u00a0began constructing\u00a0the pier and causeway in April, and it began operating on May 17. The JLOTS system consists of two parts: the floating pier where shipments are offloaded and the causeway to transfer the shipments to the distribution point in Gaza. The pier\u2019s construction came as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated and the death toll from Israel\u2019s bombardment climbed. In Gaza, the entire population has faced food insecurity. US officials previously told CNN the US military is\u00a0likely to operate\u00a0the pier for at least three months, but the ultimate goal is to turn it into a full-time commercial operation that can be used by other countries and non-governmental organizations.

The coin landed on the Biden campaign\u2019s pick \u2014 tails \u2014 which meant his campaign got to choose whether it wanted to select the president\u2019s podium position or the order of closing statements. Biden\u2019s campaign chose to select the right podium position, which means the Democratic president will be on the right side of television viewers\u2019 screens and his Republican rival will be on viewers\u2019 left. Trump\u2019s campaign then chose for the former president to deliver the last closing statement, which means Biden will go first at the conclusion of the debate. Biden and Trump are set to make history on June 27 in the first presidential debate between an incumbent and a former president. It will also be the first debate since 2020 featuring either Biden, who did not face a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination, or Trump, who skipped those held during the Republican primary race.

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_immigration-policy-biden-what-matters", "text": "In two weeks, the White House has swerved from taking tough action against asylum-seekers trying to enter the country illegally to taking strong action to show empathy for people who have lived for years in the US immigration shadows. It was in early June that President Joe Biden pulled from former President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook to severely limit protections for asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally, effectively trying to seal the border to them, and addressing a changing mood in the country with regard to asylum-seekers. That move angered many progressives and immigration advocates and drew a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. But those groups will now cheer Biden\u2019s move Tuesday, offering new protection to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants \u2013 specifically some spouses of US citizens and their children \u2013 who are already in the US. The move could grant legal status to about 500,000 American families, according to the White House. Biden promises empathy; Trump promises mass deportation The new executive action offers a major contrast with Trump, who is promising to deport more than 10 million people from the US if he\u2019s elected to a second term. At the White House, Biden argued Trump\u2019s deportation policy would \u201crip spouses and children from their families, homes and communities and place them in detention camps.\u201d From CNN\u2019s report by Michael Williams: Under current federal law, an undocumented person who enters the United States and marries a US citizen must first request parole before applying for legal residency. That process requires them to leave the country if they were there illegally, upending their careers and families and creating uncertainty about whether they would be authorized to reenter.  Tuesday\u2019s action allows those spouses to apply for residency without needing to leave the United States \u2013 a key change that the Biden administration argues will keep families intact. Read Williams\u2019 full report. Undocumented immigrants eligible for the program will have to apply, but they can stay in the US as the process unfolds. The must have been married by June 17, before the new action was announced, and they must have been in the US for at least 10 years. Is this necessary? One Biden critic argued the new policy is unnecessary since few long-standing undocumented immigrants who are married to a US citizen would ever be deported. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the problem that the Biden administration is trying to solve here, and I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d Chad Wolf, an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said on CNN. He did not address Trump\u2019s deportation pledge during the interview. Seeking \u2018balance\u2019 Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who is the first former undocumented immigrant elected to Congress, told CNN\u2019s Brianna \ufeffKeilar that while he does not support the asylum action announced earlier this month, the addition of protection for undocumented spouses and their children \u201cbalances that out in a real smart way.\u201d He argued the immigration debate is too large for one single fix. \u201cJust to do (border) enforcement or just to do what we\u2019re doing today alone is not an answer to the vast majority of the American people that are concerned about this,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cThe immigration debate is very broad,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and these are very specific items within that broader debate that are being addressed.\u201d Legal limbo Biden\u2019s move could also lack permanence. An important caveat to any immigration action is that since Congress continually fails to address the immigration issue, anything a president does with executive power might be reversed by the next administration or invalidated by courts. Look no further than the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program enacted by the Obama administration in June 2012, another strong executive action positioned for effect in an election year. Still proud of that policy, Biden announced his new program in conjunction with the 12th anniversary of DACA. Obama enacted DACA; Trump tried to end it The DACA policy was enacted after bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform efforts failed for the umpteenth time. It was meant to bring people brought to the US illegally as children, frequently referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d out of the shadows and allow them to build lives in the country where they grew up. Nearly 600,000 people have sought protected status under the program, which defers but does not necessarily end any immigration action against them. The Trump administration tried to end the DACA program in 2017, but the effort eventually failed at the Supreme Court in 2020. Instead, Trump hit pause on new applications, something the Biden administration then reversed. Would today\u2019s Supreme Court protect DACA? After the Biden administration tried to formalize the DACA process, a federal judge in 2021 agreed with Texas and other states that the program must be ended, again halting new DACA applications. That case is now under appeal and could land the DACA issue back at the Supreme Court. When a divided 5-4 court prevented the Trump administration from ending DACA in 2020,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal justice, was still on the court. She has been replaced by a conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In 2020, Chief Justice John Roberts infuriated conservatives by joining the liberal block of justices to rule against Trump on technical grounds. The new case and the new makeup of the court mean DACA is far from safe. Congress could, of course, fix all of this with action, but it has failed to pass comprehensive reform despite attempts that go back decades.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_judge-dismisses-charges-nevada-fake-electors", "text": "A Nevada judge dismissed an indictment Friday against six Republicans\u00a0accused of submitting certificates\u00a0to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election, potentially cutting from four to three the number of states with criminal charges pending against so-called fake electors. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said he\u2019ll take the issue to the state Supreme Court after Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus ruled that Las Vegas was the wrong venue for the case. \u201cThe judge got it wrong, and we\u2019ll be appealing immediately,\u201d Ford, a Democrat, told reporters afterward. He declined additional comment. Defense attorneys bluntly declared the case dead, saying that to bring it now before another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada\u2019s capital of Carson City would violate a three-year statute of limitations on filing charges that expired in December. \u201cThey\u2019re done,\u201d said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County Republican Party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants in the case. The judge called off the trial, which had been\u00a0scheduled for January, for defendants that also included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; Storey County clerk Jim Hindle; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was accused of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument \u2013 felonies that carry penalties of up to four or five years in prison. Defense attorneys led by McDonald\u2019s lawyer, Richard Wright, contended that Ford improperly brought the case before a grand jury in Las Vegas \u2014 Nevada\u2019s largest and most Democratic-leaning city \u2014 instead of Carson City or Reno, northern Nevada cities in a more Republican region where the alleged crimes occurred. They also accused prosecutors of failing to present to the grand jury evidence that would have exonerated their clients, who they said had no intent to commit a crime. \u201cCrimes are tried and venue lies in the venue in which the offense was committed,\u201d Wright told the judge on Friday. \u201cSigning the document occurred in Carson City.\u201d Challenged by Holthus to respond, Deputy State Attorney General Matthew Rashbrook argued that \u201cno one county contains the entirety of these crimes.\u201d \u201cSociety is the victim of these crimes,\u201d the prosecutor said. \u201cVoters who would have been disenfranchised by these acts \u2026 would have been victims of these crimes.\u201d But the judge decided that even though McDonald and Law live in Las Vegas, \u201ceverything took place up north.\u201d After the court hearing, Hindle\u2019s attorney, Brian Hardy, declined to comment on calls from advocacy groups for his client to resign from his elected position as overseer of elections in northern Nevada\u2019s Storey County, a jurisdiction with a few more than 4,100 residents. Those calls included a news conference Friday outside the courthouse by leaders of three organizations. The state Republican Party issued a statement welcoming the court decision, pointing to Ford\u2019s vow to appeal and asking for contributions to continue the court fight. Meehan is the only defendant not to have been named by the state party as a Nevada delegate to the\u00a02024 Republican National Convention\u00a0next month in Milwaukee. His defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her client chose not to seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in 2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford by just under 8% of the vote. Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won\u00a0in 2020, not Democrat Joe Biden. Others are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Nevada\u2019s case, filed last December, focused on the actions of six defendants. Criminal cases in three other states focus on many more \u2014 16 in\u00a0Michigan, 19 in\u00a0Georgia\u00a0and 18 in\u00a0Arizona. Kenneth Chesebro, a lawyer who\u00a0pleaded guilty in Georgia\u00a0last October to helping orchestrate the Trump campaign fake elector scheme in 2020, cooperated with prosecutors in the\u00a0Nevada criminal investigation\u00a0and was not charged. In testimony before the grand jury that met in Las Vegas in November, Chesebro said he provided the state GOP with an \u201corganized step-by-step explanation of what they would have to do\u201d to sign and submit certificates falsely stating that Trump, not Biden, won in Nevada. He also called\u00a0Nevada \u201cextremely problematic\u201d\u00a0to the fake elector plot, compared with other states, because the meeting of electors was overseen by the secretary of state. Also, unlike other states, Nevada did not have a legal challenge pending in courts at the time. Trump\u00a0lost Nevada in 2020\u00a0by more than 30,000 votes to Biden, and the state\u2019s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican. Her defense of the results as reliable and accurate led the state GOP to\u00a0censure her, but Cegavske later conducted an investigation that found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_donald-trump-vice-president-contenders", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has been busy in recent weeks. He was found guilty in his hush money trial in New York, is embroiled in three other legal cases and has continued his campaign to win back the White House. But Trump has another task: Choosing a running mate. With just weeks until the Republican National Convention, where the former president is expected to announce his pick for vice president, sources have told CNN that these are the possible contenders on Trump\u2019s mind. Doug Burgum North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum challenged Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before suspending his campaign in December. A former Microsoft executive, Burgum is a second-term governor with a conservative track record. He signed a bill last year that bans gender-affirming care for most minors and enacted a near-total ban on abortions in the state. Late last month, Burgum \u2014\u00a0who was among the candidates that received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign \u2014 told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins that \u201cthe whole discussion about the veepstakes \u2026 is kind of a giant distraction.\u201d \u201c(Trump) can win this election on his own,\u201d Burgum said, adding that the \u201cpeople of this country\u201d are \u201cfocused on the issues\u201d and \u201cnot on who\u2019s going to be the VP.\u201d Marco Rubio With several Trump insiders encouraging the former president to consider a Hispanic running mate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 the son of Cuban immigrants \u2014 could be an appealing choice. Rubio ran against Trump in 2016, positioning himself at the time as the only person who could stop Trump. But since then, Rubio has adopted Trumpism and regularly defends the former president. The senator, who was first elected to his office in 2010, is among the candidates who received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign, and if chosen, Rubio would be the first Hispanic running mate on a major party ticket. The senator helped the former president gear up for the June debate against President Joe Biden by participating in a policy discussion. But he faces a potential hurdle. Rubio and Trump are both Florida residents and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0the Constitution prevents electors\u00a0from voting for two people from the same state. This could be detrimental if the election is close \u2014\u00a0and the Trump campaign expects it to be so, according to multiple Trump advisers. Rubio has not ruled out changing his residence. J.D. Vance Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a freshman, entered Congress with the help of the former president, whose endorsement helped him win a contentious race in 2022. Vance was critical of Trump in 2016, and, six year later, Trump publicly humiliated Vance even after endorsing him in the 2022 election. Still, Vance is an outspoken supporter of Trump in Congress, and often votes in allegiance with the former president\u2019s interests. He opposed a Ukraine aid bill\u00a0earlier this year, adopting Trump\u2019s criticism of providing more aid. He is also close with Donald Trump Jr. Vance, a former venture capitalist, veteran and author, is among the candidates who received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign. When asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins if he has any pause to be Trump\u2019s running mate given Trump\u2019s treatment of his former vice president, Vance said he is \u201cextremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger\u201d on January 6, 2021, the day of the riot at the US Capitol. Tim Scott Trump has said Tim Scott is \u201ca guy I look at\u201d when asked on a radio show earlier this year if the South Carolina senator was a front-runner to be his potential running mate. While Scott challenged Trump for the Republican nomination this election cycle, he ran a campaign that avoided being overly critical of the former president and often expressed support for policies enacted during the Trump administration, positioning himself to be considered as a running mate. Since he suspended his campaign in November, he has aligned himself closely with Trump, and he is among the candidates who were sent various levels of paperwork in the vice-presidential vetting process. Scott was appointed to the Senate in 2013 by then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. He retained the seat in a 2014 special election, was reelected to a full term in 2016 and won a second full term in 2022. He has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress and rarely broke with Trump during the latter\u2019s presidency. Elise Stefanik House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik was once a Trump skeptic during the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency. She has since emerged as one of the former president\u2019s most ardent supporters in Congress. Stefanik delivered a strong defense of Trump during his 2019 impeachment trial, which positioned her as a \u201cRepublican star,\u201d\u00a0as the then-president said at the time. She then objected to Biden\u2019s 2020 win in the House and promoted election lies. Trump has at various times asked donors and allies what they think about Stefanik as a potential vice president, though her perceived\u00a0zeal for the job turned off some of the former president\u2019s advisers, one person close to Trump previously told CNN. Stefanik\u00a0\u2014 who was among the candidates who were sent various levels of paperwork in the vice-presidential vetting process \u2014\u00a0has publicly expressed interest in becoming Trump\u2019s running mate or for a Cabinet position if he wins. The congresswoman, who was first elected in 2014, told CNN earlier this year that she\u2019s \u201cproud to be a top surrogate\u201d and \u201cwould proudly serve in a future Trump administration.\u201d Ben Carson Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson challenged Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016. And while Carson \u2014 who didn\u2019t win a single primary contest \u2014 didn\u2019t immediately endorse Trump, he did offer a strong defense of the man who would eventually become president. \u201cPeople who think Donald Trump would be the worst thing that ever happened \u2026 you make a really big mistake by trying to thwart the will of the people,\u201d Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said while suspending his campaign. Once Trump was elected, Carson turned down the then-president-elect\u2019s offer to be his health and human services secretary. But he eventually led the Department of Housing and Urban Development, despite criticism that he was not qualified to do so. Carson \u2014\u00a0who is among the candidates who received various levels of paperwork in the vice-presidential vetting process \u2014 disagrees with Trump\u2019s stance on one key issue: Abortion. In his new book, \u201cThe Perilous Fight,\u201d Carson argued in favor of a legislation that \u201cguarantees the right to life for all American citizens, including those still in the womb.\u201d Trump has said that he would not sign a federal abortion ban if he\u2019s back in office. Byron Donalds Florida Rep. Byron Donalds is a Trump loyalist and one of the former president\u2019s most trusted surrogates. He rose to prominence in Trump world last year when he\u00a0endorsed Trump\u00a0over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, and he has received routine praise and public support from the former president. He was part of\u00a0a launch\u00a0of the\u00a0\u201cBlack\u00a0Americans for Trump\u201d group meant to target Black voters as the Trump campaign seeks to win over voters from the traditionally Democratic bloc. Donalds has been outspoken on related issues, including controversial\u00a0comments he made\u00a0earlier this month suggesting that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d\u00a0during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Donalds has been confident that if selected as Trump\u2019s vice president, he would be able to assume the role of commander in chief, if necessary, and said he will support Trump however he decides. \u201cI think that I have the ability to step in,\u201d Donalds said in June on NBC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cMeet\u00a0the Press.\u201d\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u00a0actually pretty intelligent.\u201d Nikki Haley Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was the last Trump opponent to stay in the GOP presidential race and on the trail, she tried to distinguish herself from the former president as the better alternative to reel in moderate and independent voters in a general election against Biden. When asked if he would consider Haley as his running mate, Trump said earlier this month that he \u201cwas very disappointed in her because she stayed too long.\u201d Haley, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said on the trail\u00a0that she feels \u201cno need to kiss the ring.\u201d Even after suspending her campaign, she didn\u2019t immediately endorse the former president and instead urged him to \u201cearn\u201d the support of voters who backed her. But she ultimately said last month that she\u2019d be voting for her former boss. Even after Haley suspended her campaign, tens of thousands of voters continued to vote for her in Republican primaries across the country. Her selection could help Trump win over GOP voters who are seeking an alternative to the former president. Still, Trump himself said on Truth Social that she is not under consideration. Haley was elected as governor of South Carolina in 2011, making history as\u00a0the first woman\u00a0and the first person of an ethnic minority to hold governorship in the state. In the Trump administration, she was initially considered for secretary of state before being offered the UN ambassadorship \u2014 a role she said she accepted on conditions that she be a Cabinet member, be on the National Security Council and have the ability to speak her mind. She resigned as ambassador in October 2018. Tom Cotton Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton spent months exploring a 2024 presidential run, but eventually decided after the 2022 midterms that he would not join the race. First elected to the US House in 2012 and then to the US Senate in 2014, the Afghanistan and Iraq War veteran has established himself as a conservative security hawk. He also put a long-standing hold on US attorney and US marshal nominations. Cotton announced earlier this year that he would run for Senate Republican conference chair, the third-ranking leadership position in GOP leadership. However, he told NBC earlier this month that \u201cany great patriot, if offered a chance to serve our country by the president, would have to consider it seriously.\u201d However, he said he has not talked to Trump or his campaign about the role \u201cor any position in his administration.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ran as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, but left the party to become an independent in 2022, alleging that her former party is \u201cunder the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness.\u201d Gabbard, a veteran, was first elected to Congress in 2012, making history as the first American Samoan woman and first practicing\u00a0Hindu\u00a0member in Congress. She also served as the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. She left Congress in 2021. As a congresswoman, she voted \u201cpresent\u201d on both articles of impeachment against Trump in 2019. And in recent months, she has ramped up her praise and defense of the former president, alleging at a Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year that \u201cthe Democrat elite and cronies\u201d are \u201cusing our criminal system to prosecute\u201d Trump and \u201cundermine his support.\u201d Gabbard has publicly expressed interest in joining the ticket, telling an audience in response to a question at a book event, \u201cIf asked to serve in that way, I would be honored to do so,\u201d\u00a0according to the New York Times. In 2016, Gabbard was considered by Trump for jobs at the Defense Department, State Department and the United Nations, a source then told CNN.

Trump was responding to another one of the podcast hosts, investor\u00a0Jason Calacanis, who asked the former president, \u201cCan you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest from around the world to America?\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that graduates would be screened \u201cto exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges.\u201d \u201cHe believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America. This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers,\u201d Leavitt said in a statement to CNN. Trump has made immigration a central focus of his 2024 bid for the White House, promising to carry out \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history\u201d and using the issue to attack President Joe Biden\u2019s leadership. His latest comments come after Biden earlier this week announced an executive action allowing certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country. The election-year move from the president, intended to appeal to key Latino voters in battleground states, followed a more restrictive action earlier this month to limit asylum processing at the US southern border. Trump on the podcast complained that some foreign graduates of top US colleges cannot start companies in the US and instead found their companies in other countries like India or China. \u201cYou need a pool of people to work for your companies and they have to be smart people. \u2026 You need brilliant people and we force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges. You have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people,\u201d the former president said. Trump\u2019s remarks are at odds with his efforts to limit immigration when he was in the White House, including targeting visa programs that tech companies use to bring in thousands of skilled workers and directing federal agencies to employ what he called a \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d strategy to promote the hiring of American workers.\u00a0Trump also tried to restrict refugee resettlement and temporarily banned travel from seven Muslim majority countries while in office. In his third presidential run, Trump regularly stokes fears about undocumented migrants, claiming without evidence the vast majority are violent criminals as he rails against Biden\u2019s immigration policies. His language \u2013 including saying that undocumented immigrants were \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d \u2013 has often drawn rebuke from his opponent\u2019s campaign. When Trump ran for president in 2015, he expressed support for some foreign nationals graduating from US colleges having a pathway to citizenship. \u201cI also want people of great talent to come to this country, to Silicon Valley for engineers. If you go to Harvard and you graduate No. 1 in your class, and you\u2019re from China, they send you home, you can\u2019t get back into the country. So you end up working for companies in China and fighting us,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Time magazine.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_bloomberg-donate-biden-election", "text": "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has donated nearly $20 million to efforts to reelect President Joe Biden, people familiar with the matter told CNN, a significant cash infusion at a time when the president\u2019s fundraising operation is lagging behind that of his rival, Donald Trump. Bloomberg, a former Republican-turned-independent who later faced off against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary, gave the max donation of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising entity of the Biden campaign and Democratic Party Committees, a campaign official said. He has also donated $19 million to the FF PAC, the main super PAC working to promote Biden\u2019s reelection bid that is also known as Future Forward, a source familiar with the donation said. Future Forward, which is acting with the blessing of the president\u2019s top aides, has reserved $250 million in television and digital advertising in battleground states between the Democratic Convention in August through Election Day. The Washington Post was first to report on Bloomberg\u2019s donations. In the 2020 campaign, Bloomberg heavily spent to support Biden in Florida, a state Biden ultimately lost to Trump. Meanwhile, Trump also received a huge fundraising boost from a billionaire in May with a $50 million cash infusion to a super PAC backing his campaign from Timothy Mellon, an heir to a banking fortune who has emerged as one of the single largest donors in this year\u2019s presidential election. The $50 million donation from Mellon to the Trump-aligned MAGA Inc. super PAC last month accounted for the lion\u2019s share of the $68.8 million that the group reported raising in May, new filings show. The donation, recorded a day after Trump\u2019s conviction in New York, is helping to fuel the super PAC\u2019s planned $100 million advertising blitz over the summer. In all, Mellon has donated $100 million to super PACs associated with presidential candidates \u2013 making him one of the biggest financial figures of the 2024 campaign. Before last month, the Wyoming-based investor had donated $25 million apiece to the pro-Trump super PAC and to one supporting the long-shot independent campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Bloomberg, who made a late entry into the\u00a02020 Democratic race, offered a more moderate vision for the country and cast himself as a problem solver in his efforts. He is the co-founder of Bloomberg L.P., a privately-held financial, software, data, and media company. When Bloomberg, who spent hundreds of millions of his own money to fund his late entry bid,\u00a0ended his presidential campaign, he endorsed Biden. The former New York mayor said at the time that he got into the race\u00a0\u201cto\u00a0defeat Donald Trump\u201d and was\u00a0\u201cleaving\u00a0for the same reason.\u201d Biden, who held a financial advantage over Trump for much of the 2024 campaign cycle, has seen his fundraising trail his rival for the past two months. On Thursday night, Biden and the Democratic Party announced that they raised $85 million in May, a figure that is well short of the staggering $141 million that Trump and his political operation said it collected last month. Trump\u2019s fundraising was significantly boosted by tens of millions of dollars collected in the immediate aftermath of his\u00a0May 30 conviction\u00a0in a New York criminal case for falsifying business records. Biden\u2019s campaign said Thursday that his committees entered June with a massive $212 million cash stockpile. The Trump campaign has not yet disclosed cash-on-hand figures for all of its committees. Campaigns don\u2019t have to do so until next month, but Federal Election Commission filings late Thursday offered a partial picture, showing Trump\u2019s main committee with more than $116.5 million in cash reserves at May 31 while Biden\u2019s main campaign account held $91.6 million \u2014\u00a0a stark reversal of fortune from just a month earlier, when Biden had a $35 million cash edge.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked at a press conference in Italy last week about whether China was selling Russia arms for use in the war. Biden, who was standing beside him, waited for Zelensky to say President Xi Jinping told him he would not do so, before delivering a parting shot and ending the event. \u201cBy the way, China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it.\u00a0So, it is, in fact, helping Russia.\u201d The comment appeared to signal a hardening tone toward Beijing following months of US warnings that it shouldn\u2019t help its friends in Moscow over the war. NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg reinforced the tough new line during a visit to Washington Monday that included Oval Office talks with Biden. \u201cPublicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he\u2019s taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China\u2019s fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\u201d Stoltenberg said at The Wilson Center. \u201cAt the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\u201d Concerns that America\u2019s enemies are aiding Russia\u2019s war effort are sure to grow with the impending trip by Putin to North Korea, which the Kremlin said would have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d list of events, including with the isolated Stalinist state\u2019s tyrannical leader Kim Jong Un. The idea of an anti-US front among Russia, China, North Korea and Iran has long preoccupied foreign policy experts in Washington. Up until recently, US intelligence agencies have assessed that differences between the uneasy partners make formal alliances unlikely. But all those powers have one big thing in common: a desire to thwart American goals and power. Each is also subject to a brutal autocratic regime that is threatened by the democracy that unites the US and its European and Asian allies. The announcement that Putin is headed to Pyongyang raised the state of alert in Washington and caused expressions of concern from across the government. In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress that Russia\u2019s need to replenish its military supplies had forced it to grant \u201clong-sought concessions\u201d to North Korea. She did not specify the extent of the cooperation, but her comment sparked speculation that Moscow was offering nuclear or missile expertise. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell added to the intrigue last week when he said at a Stimson Center event that the North Koreans have embarked on a series of \u201cprovocative\u201d actions including by supplying Russia with artillery and missiles. And he added: \u201cWe have a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia and they have had a substantial impact on the battlefield.\u201d But the US doesn\u2019t seem to know what Kim will get in return. \u201cWhat is Russia going to provide in exchange to North Korea,\u00a0hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know but we are concerned by that and are watching carefully.\u201d He added: \u201cThe entire scope of the Russia/North Korea relationship is something we follow carefully and are concerned about.\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Monday that North Korea had unlawfully transferred dozens of ballistic missiles and over 11,000 containers of munitions to aid Russia\u2019s war effort. \u201cWe have seen those munitions show up on the battlefield in Ukraine. So, we know that they are using DPRK ammunition to threaten Ukraine and kill Ukrainians,\u201d he said. And White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said that while the US wasn\u2019t concerned about Putin\u2019s trip, it was looking to see whether it worsened security conditions in Ukraine and in Northeast Asia. \u201cWhat we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries not just because of the impacts it\u2019s going to have on the Ukrainian people, because we know North Korean ballistic missiles are still being used to hit Ukrainian targets, but because there could be some reciprocity here that could affect security on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Kirby added: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to be watching that very, very closely.\u201d Putin and Kim clearly know Washington is watching. In an article in North Korea\u2019s official\u00a0Rodong Sinmun newspaper,\u00a0the Russian leader wrote: \u201cWe highly appreciate the DPRK\u2019s unwavering support for Russia\u2019s special military operation in Ukraine.\u201d And he called the isolated state Russia\u2019s \u201ccommitted and like-minded supporter, ready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_election-age-what-matters", "text": "A truism of American politics is that older voters prefer the Republican and younger voters prefer the Democrat. That\u2019s what happened in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won voters under 50 and Republican Donald Trump won voters over 50, according to exit polls. Biden\u2019s margin among younger voters \u2014 he got 65% of voters ages 18-24 \u2014 helped him overcome the fact that Trump got 52% of older voters, who accounted for more than half the electorate. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College even though she got more votes than him, but the pattern of younger voters supporting the Democrat held. Clinton got more votes among voters ages 18-44, and Trump got more votes among voters ages 45 and older, according to exit polls. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney lost the election, but he did better than Democrat Barack Obama among voters 45 and older. Voters under 30 haven\u2019t preferred the Republican since 1988, when George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in a landslide. Voters over the age of 65 haven\u2019t preferred the Democrat since 2000, when Al Gore lost the election despite getting more votes than Republican George W. Bush. But the old rules don\u2019t seem to apply in this year\u2019s presidential election, where both candidates are old men and their fitness to serve is a top issue. Older voters are gravitating to Biden, and younger voters are taking a look at Trump. A new Marist poll in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, for instance, showed a tight race overall with Trump at 47% and Biden at 45%, a within-the-margin-of-error difference. Trump is making inroads with voters of color and is nearly even with Biden among voters under 45 in that poll. But older voters have gone in the opposite direction, and instead of favoring Trump, are nearly split in the Marist poll. It\u2019s a trend that extends to other states. In a nationwide Quinnipiac University poll released in May, Biden and Trump split younger voters, but Biden has an edge among voters 65 and older. Not\u00a0every poll shows the same\u00a0level of shift,\u00a0but\u00a0the general movement among both younger and older voters is\u00a0a departure from past results. Biden is now leaning into questions about his age that have dogged his reelection campaign and worry voters in opinion polls. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d first lady Jill Biden said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin this week, part of a three-day swing designed to boost his support among older voters. Older voters are essentially Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s peers. Both men were born in the 1940s. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Eric Bradner note that older voters were \u201calive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy.\u201d They also write that \u201cin 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country.\u201d In Michigan, Zeleny and Bradner talked to Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who only got active in politics after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen,\u201d she said. Despite the shift of older voters in the direction of Biden (and younger voters away from him), I was surprised to see older voters still have reservations about Biden\u2019s age. In a February New York Times/Siena College poll, nearly three-quarters of registered voters ages 65 and older said Biden was too old to be effective as president compared with less than half who said the same about Trump. Those figures tracked with the population at large. CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein noted last year that older voters were more likely to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance and argued that some of his policy wins, like pushing for lowering drug costs in Medicare, appeal directly to seniors. Whatever the reason, if Biden is to overcome questions about his age to keep his job, it will be with help from people his own age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/election-age-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-elections-what-matters", "text": "With Democrats divided over the Israel-Hamas war, uninspired by their presidential nominee in Joe Biden and planning a convention in Chicago, there have been multiple comparisons to 1968, when Democrat Hubert Humphrey lost the White House to Republican Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War divided Democrats that year. Humphrey was uninspiring to younger voters opposed to the war. There was violence outside their convention in Chicago. Democrats today should hope that a better comparison is to 1948, when then-President Harry Truman, an unpopular incumbent, pulled off a surprise reelection versus Thomas Dewey, then the Republican governor of New York. That year, 1948, was also a much better year for Humphrey, then the young and inspiring Minneapolis mayor who helped push Democrats on the road to embracing civil rights legislation that would ultimately remake both political parties over the coming decades. I talked to Samuel Freedman, a Columbia Journalism School professor, about his recent book about Humphrey and the 1948 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. The book\u2019s title, \u201cInto the Bright Sunshine,\u201d is taken from a line in Humphrey\u2019s rousing speech on civil rights. The crackling audio does not hide the competing jeers and applause when Humphrey says: My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on states\u2019 rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states\u2019 rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. It is a particularly important time to remember right now, when there is an effort on the American political right to reinterpret the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Here\u2019s my conversation with Freedman, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity: Lessons for 2024 Biden from 1948 Truman WOLF: The fulcrum of the book is this 1948 Democratic convention and Humphrey\u2019s civil rights speech there. Until 2016, 1948 was probably the biggest presidential election upset in US history. What could 2024 Joe Biden, who trails Donald Trump in much of the polling, learn from 1948 Harry Truman, who trailed Thomas Dewey right to the end? FREEDMAN: They are very comparable experiences, even with the fact that Truman had not one third party, but two third parties also to worry about \u2013 Henry Wallace to his left and Strom Thurmond to his right. We don\u2019t know about the effect in the tight election of RFK Jr., and even for that matter, of (the Green Party\u2019s) Jill Stein. So Biden has a complicated course to run. Truman went back and forth on civil rights \u2013 he was very bold, amazingly so in 1946 and \u201947, then he backed away out of fear it would cost him the election in \u201848. Really what Humphrey\u2019s triumph with the civil rights plank at the \u201848 convention did is it forced Truman to run as a civil rights candidate, which ended up being the reason he won the race. He really starts it in July, Truman, by desegregating the military and the federal workforce, and he culminates it the last weekend before Election Day, having a rally and giving a campaign speech in Harlem, which no major party presidential candidate had ever done. So I think part of the lesson of what Truman did, for Biden, is to try to be bold, to be assertive, to take some of the risks that need to be taken. Humphrey went from heroic to ridiculed WOLF: Today, we look at Hubert Humphrey as an also-ran of American politics. What were you trying to accomplish writing a book that leads up to this single speech at the \u201948 convention? FREEDMAN: I wanted to fill two gaps. I wanted to, first of all, fill a biographical gap about Humphrey, because if people know him at all today, it\u2019s from a largely disparaged and ridiculed latter part of his career supporting the Vietnam War as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s vice president, getting the presidential nomination in 1968 amid the police riot in Chicago, and then really fecklessly, almost pathetically, running as the establishment candidate against George McGovern for the Democratic nomination in 1972. And yet, there was this amazing chapter in his earlier life when he had been out there in a way few White Americans of the time were, really putting his entire career at risk to fight the fight for civil rights. People who felt betrayed by Humphrey in the \u201960s because he was no longer being a liberal hero forgot why they thought he was a liberal hero in the first place. And what he did in the 1948 convention is the epitome of it, to get the Democratic Party to endorse the civil rights agenda for the first time ever, and to accomplish something that FDR hadn\u2019t been willing to do, which was to defy and ultimately oust the Southern segregationist wing of the party. The other gap I wanted to fill was a historical gap, because a lot of the great writing that\u2019s been done about the Civil Rights Movement tends to position its origins in the 1950s with the Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Ed decision, and so forth. And yet, there was all this activity in the \u201940s, very much catalyzed by Black GIs and the Double V movement (victory in the war and victory over oppression at home). You know, very much affected by the global war against fascism, and that activity really anticipates and makes possible everything that happens in the \u201950s and \u201860s, and yet has gotten much less attention, comparatively speaking. So those were the two gaps I was aiming to address. 2024 vs. 1968 WOLF: Humphrey is certainly more associated with that \u201968 convention. This year, there\u2019s obviously a fractured Democratic Party, as there was in 1968, and the convention is again in Chicago. What are the similarities you see between this year and \u201868? FREEDMAN:  There are a couple of takeaways from Humphrey\u2019s campaign in \u201968. One is you\u2019ve got to really hit the right tone. The speech that he made in April of 1968 to announce his campaign was so tone-deaf. It talked about the politics of happiness, the politics of joy, and it was completely out of tune with the tenor of the times. This is like three and a half weeks after Martin Luther King had been killed. It\u2019s just about as long as after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There was a massive anti-war movement. It just felt like Humphrey, who usually had such a keen sense of retail politics, totally misread the mood of the country. He struggled, really for the rest of the campaign, to come back to finding a way to stick to things he wanted to stick to about hope and unity and possibility, while trying to find the words, and I think never really quite succeeding, to acknowledge the hurt, the anxiety, the division within the country. It\u2019s also a lesson about the importance of optics, and this is even before the 24-hour news cycle. Humphrey is giving his speech at the \u201968 convention, where in the middle of his speech, the live TV coverage cuts away to show the Chicago police beating demonstrators and journalists on the streets of Chicago. It\u2019s the most catastrophic optic you could imagine. Another similarity is that although Joe Biden has run essentially unopposed in primaries, it\u2019s almost as if he didn\u2019t really have to face the Democratic voting public this year, the way he definitely did in 2020, and comes in as feeling more coordinated and less chosen. In 1968, the Democratic Party was operating under old rules in which primary voters actually had relatively little direct effect on delegates. Humphrey enters late, after Bobby Kennedy had been in, after Eugene McCarthy had been in, and won most of his delegates by going through the party apparatus. So it looked like he had this nomination kind of handed to him by the machine, over and against the passions of the voters, who had turned out in large numbers for Bobby Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. That also presents a problem of how do you build up the requisite passion? At the end of the day, he did something in late September that almost saved his campaign, which was finally to break away from Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and to stake out a much bolder peace plank on Vietnam. In fact, it was a peace plank that was defeated at the convention where Humphrey\u2019s forces opposed it. Had Humphrey done that sooner would he have won? Good question. The other important thing Humphrey said, that I think Biden really has to find a way to express, came from the speech accepting the nomination. I\u2019m going to read you this paragraph, because I think it\u2019s so prescient. He says: I say to those who\u2019ve differed with their neighbor or with those who\u2019ve differed with their fellow Democrat, may I say to you that all of your goals, all of your high hopes, all of your dreams, all them will come to naught if we lose this election, and many of them can be realized with the victory that can come to us. That is so exactly right, and it\u2019s something that Joe Biden has to communicate. Just like for people, particularly young liberals, who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humphrey in \u201968, what they got was Nixon. What they got was, instead of peace talks and a bombing halt, and an internationally supervised ceasefire, which was Humphrey\u2019s stance by the end of the campaign, they got the war going on for seven more years, with tens of thousands more American deaths and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Vietnamese deaths. They got Watergate. They got the race-baiting that Nixon engaged in. They got the proto-Trump pseudo populism of Spiro Agnew as vice president. So there\u2019s a real price to pay there for hanging on to your purity of not being able to vote for Hubert Humphrey and forgive him even the egregious mistake on Vietnam because of everything else he brought to the table that was absolutely consistent with the liberal agenda. Correcting the counterfactual about Republicans and civil rights WOLF: As I was reading the climax of this book, there was an interview on CNN with Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican from Florida, who was arguing this counterfactual \u2013 and you can find many other instances of it \u2013 that a lot of present-day Republicans are pushing that they deserve credit for the Civil Rights Movement, because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, because there were Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act. This comes up in your descriptions of the \u201948 convention, particularly with Strom Thurmond (the South Carolina Democrat turned Republican). I was hoping to get your historical analysis of that idea. FREEDMAN: It\u2019s preposterous for the Republicans to make that argument in 2024 or at any time in the last 60 years, to be honest. When Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948, that\u2019s the beginning of the vast majority of the White South becoming Republicans, stepping away from the Democratic Party. Even though (Adlai) Stevenson in \u201952 and \u201856 and JFK in 1960 tried to lure them back in, it was still the beginning of a process by which \u2013 with Barry Goldwater in \u201964, who opposed civil rights legislation; Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in \u201868 and \u201872; (Ronald) Reagan\u2019s appeals to racial resentment in \u201880 and \u201884; the Willie Horton ad in \u201888; and then to Trump in all of his races \u2013 that all began in \u201848. Those people who walked out with Strom Thurmond and the voters who voted for them never really went back to the Democratic Party again. While the party labels have remained the same \u2013 there is still the Democratic Party and there is still the Republican Party \u2013 the people who are voting have totally exchanged places, because the parties exchanged places on the issue of civil rights. It\u2019s true that, going back to Lincoln, the Republicans were seen as the party of emancipation and the amendments that created, at least on paper, racial equality. On that basis, until 1948 really with Truman, and then in even larger numbers in 1964 with LBJ and consistently since then, the White Southern vote that used to go to the Democrats, because the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow, has become the solid White vote for the Republican Party. Show me a major Republican politician in the MAGA movement who is a fervent supporter of civil rights legislation. In any kind of iteration, you don\u2019t have (Republicans) now like Mitt Romney\u2019s father, (former Michigan Gov.) George Romney, or (former Pennsylvania Gov.) William Scranton, or Edward Brooke, a Black senator from Massachusetts \u2026 You don\u2019t even have people like Nixon, before he went bad on civil rights, who was a really active member of the NAACP. That doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican Party anymore, and it\u2019s just absurd to say that because 80 years ago to 100, 120 years ago, the Democrats were indeed the party of segregation, that that\u2019s somehow still the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-elections-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The president and his campaign are blasting the presumptive Republican nominee as a criminal and a racist who was found liable for sexual assault and who is now being driven so \u201ccrazy\u201d by his loss in 2020 that he\u2019s been left \u201cunhinged.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most\u00a0searing portrayals in the modern age by an incumbent president of his challenger and is designed to define the 45th president as flagrantly unfit for a return to the office he left in disgrace in 2021. With his two impeachments, a criminal conviction and an attempt to overturn the last election, Trump gave Biden plenty to work with. But Biden\u2019s strategy may also tell the story of a reelection campaign that is going nowhere near as well as the president must have hoped, as he battles diminished standing across swathes of the electorate and faces a dauntingly narrow path to the 270 electoral voters needed to win in November. New fundraising figures announced by Biden and the Democratic Party on Thursday reveal that Trump and his team outraised the president for the second month in a row, largely erasing what was a financial advantage held by Biden for much of the campaign cycle. For months, Biden\u2019s team has argued that when the choice between the president and his predecessor became clear to voters, the stakes of the election would shift the political equation in his favor. The theory was that voters were slow to tune into the race and that they may need reminding about the chaos and the discord of Trump\u2019s first term that ended in the worst assault on democracy in generations. But it\u2019s now midsummer, and the election is less than five months away. There\u2019s every sign the race is still shaping up as much as a referendum on Biden \u2013 and a weary populace\u2019s lost sense of economic security \u2013 as it is on the threat to the rule of law that Trump is making clear a second term would entail. The president\u2019s campaign is therefore intensifying an effort to highlight the perceived consequences of a new White House mandate for Trump, who has pledged to use presidential power to exact personal retribution, while conservative groups polish blueprints for an overhaul of the bureaucracy, energy, and economic policy. Biden\u2019s best chance to reset the choice comes in his first debate with Trump on CNN in six days \u2014 a confrontation that the Biden campaign is trying to shape with daily attacks on Trump, looking to appeal to demographic groups the president hopes will return him to the White House. Some small shifts toward the president have emerged in some polling since Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in his hush money in New York last month. But the race has been mostly stable with no clear leader for months, which should be troubling to a president who is asking voters to reward him with a new term. Biden\u2019s best chance for a reset Thursday\u2019s debate will also represent the president\u2019s opportunity before tens of millions of television viewers to counter the bleak character sketch Trump is conjuring of him. The ex-president portrays his rival as a doddering incompetent who can\u2019t make it to the end of a sentence. This picture is exaggerated. But polls show that most Americans worry about the age and capacity of a president who has noticeably slowed physically in recent years and who would be 86 by the end of a second term. Trump isn\u2019t much younger, and if he wins, he\u2019d be the oldest president, at 78, to begin a second term. Biden has been road testing his character attacks on Trump for weeks in fundraising events and they\u2019re now increasingly being parroted by campaign officials. At a fundraiser attended by former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in northern Virginia on Tuesday, Biden laid out a stark scenario that included a warning that his rival was waging an all-out assault on the legal system. \u201cThe threat Trump poses would be greater in a second term than it was in his first term.\u00a0You know \u2026 I think he\u00a0snapped\u00a0when he lost in 2020.\u00a0He can\u2019t accept he lost.\u00a0(It\u2019s) literally driving him crazy. \u2026 He\u2019s not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he\u2019s clearly a little bit unhinged right now.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has been seizing the initiative all week as it lays the groundwork for the message it clearly hopes Americans will take away from the debate. On Monday, it debuted a hard-hitting new ad. \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself,\u201d the narrator says as the former president\u2019s mug shot splashes across the screen. \u201cAnd a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The gambit erased any doubt over how Biden will seek to exploit a guilty verdict against Trump and his three other criminal indictments to which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty. The ex-president\u2019s campaign will respond by claiming Biden\u2019s strategy is proof of an attempt to weaponize the justice system against him. But since Trump\u2019s campaign is already spinning that narrative anyway, Biden may have little to lose. The ad, part of a $50 million ad buy in June online, on battleground state TV channels and on national cable, references the hush money trial and Trump\u2019s losses in a defamation suit to the writer E. Jean Carroll and a civil fraud trial. Captions laid over dark, monochrome photos of Trump at court read \u201cConvicted \u2014 34 Felonies\u201d; \u201cLiable for Sexual Assault\u201d; \u201cCommitted Financial Fraud.\u201d Then, the video flips into full color with a shot of a beaming Biden surrounded by workers while it touts his efforts to cut health care costs and take on corporations. The contrast could not be more striking, and the Biden campaign must hope that it at last begins to take root in voters\u2019 minds. \u201cThe people of America are going to very soon have a choice between Donald Trump, who wakes up every day thinking about himself, thinking about his billionaire friends and then thinks about how he\u2019s going to hurt people that he thinks have hurt him,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d on Thursday. \u201cJoe Biden wakes up every day fighting for the American people, making sure that we\u2019re going to protect people\u2019s freedoms, protect democracy and lower costs,\u201d Landrieu told Manu Raju. Biden seeks to move the goalposts with ads during soccer tournament The Biden campaign is now making daily pitches to a significant corner of his coalition showing signs of stress. Wednesday, the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the US, saw a stinging attack on Trump, designed to thwart his attempt to make inroads with Black voters \u2013 a vital Democratic voting block. \u201cAfter a lifetime of racism and in honor of the holiday, the least Trump could do is give Black America a day off from his campaign\u2019s racist, empty pandering,\u201d Jasmine Harris, the campaign\u2019s director of Black media, said in a statement. \u201cBlack voters have had enough \u2013 and they\u2019re ready to put an end to Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d The campaign also sent around a list of the many race controversies precipitated by Trump during his lifetime, including his call for the execution of five Black youths over the sexual assault of a woman in Central Park, New York, who were later found to be wrongly convicted, and his long-running racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. During the 2020 election, CNN exit polls showed that Trump got around 12% of the votes of Black Americans. But some recent opinion polls suggest he\u2019s currently getting around 20%. That kind of performance in 2024 could squeeze Biden\u2019s margins in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where he needs strong Black turnout in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee to counter Trump\u2019s strong advantage in more rural areas. On Thursday, the Biden campaign turned to Hispanic voters \u2014 another key voting bloc where polls suggest he is underperforming. His campaign laid a seven-figure bet on the Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2014 the international soccer tournament featuring Western hemisphere men\u2019s teams that Lionel Messi and his World Cup-winning Argentina team kicked off in Atlanta on Thursday night. A new ad featuring the president and slamming Trump will air during games over the next few weeks as Biden\u2019s campaign seeks to remind Latino voters about Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cFour years ago, we were shut down. Stadiums were empty. Trump failed us,\u201d a narrator says over images of empty stadiums, arguing that Biden reopened the country and created 15.6 million jobs. The ad then cuts to a shot of Biden in what looks like a sports bar as the soundtrack plays the \u201cGoalllllllllllllll!\u201d cry that South American commentators use when the ball hits the back of the net. According to an NBC News poll in February, Biden and Trump are tied among Latinos, a constituency that has traditionally voted for Democrats. But Biden won the critical demographic 65% to 32% in 2020, according to exit polls. Unless he can get somewhere near that percentage again, key swing states in the West like Arizona and Nevada could be out of his reach and even competitive states further east that he also won four years ago, like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where there are smaller Hispanic populations, could be at risk. Biden\u2019s character attacks on Trump represent his best attempt to remind Americans of the fateful nature of the choice they will face in November. Those hits would be remarkable enough if the presumptive GOP nominee were a neophyte candidate who could be easily defined by negative advertising. But most voters already know exactly who Trump is. So, the finely balanced contest poses a question with which Democrats might prefer not to wrestle: What if enough persuadable voters are fully familiar with Trump\u2019s past and remember the mayhem and division of his White House term \u2013 but still aren\u2019t ready to support Biden?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/biden-trump-character-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_bannon-trump-election-what-matters", "text": "Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist in the White House, used the language of war to fire up a conservative gathering over the weekend, promising to remake the US government and completely deconstruct the FBI. Comparing the presidential campaign to the D-Day invasion, Bannon encouraged a cheering crowd at the Turning Point Action convention in Detroit to see themselves as filling the positions of fallen soldiers in an assault. \u2018War to the knife\u2019 \u201cAre we at war?\u201d he asked the crowd. \u201cIs this a political war to the knife?\u201d I was not familiar with that term \u2013 \u201cwar to the knife\u201d \u2013 but Bannon also recently used it in an interview with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. A Google search yielded a 1998 book by that name about the Bleeding Kansas skirmishes in the years before the Civil War when pro- and anti-slavery settlers flooded into Kansas and feuded over whether Kansas should enter the union as a free or slave state. The book, according to its description, attributes the term to the Atchison Squatter Sovereign, which the Library of Congress describes as a pro-slavery newspaper of the era. It\u2019s not clear where Bannon got the term. \u201cAre you prepared to leave it all on the battlefield in 2024?\u201d he asked of Turning Point activists. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple: victory or death!\u201d he later added. The Trump campaign, which has spent large portions of fundraising on the former president\u2019s legal bills, has indicated it will rely on organizations like Turning Point Action to mobilize young activists, get out the vote in November and also to challenge votes of their opponents. Read more about the campaign\u2019s strategy from CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene. Previously pardoned, now facing prison The use of such violent imagery is important when considering it came from Bannon, a Trump true-believer who worked for a time in Trump\u2019s White House and has continued to try to influence Trump ever since. The stakes of the election must be extremely high from Bannon\u2019s perspective. Already pardoned by Trump for his role in a scheme to allegedly defraud donors of contributions intended to help build a border wall, Bannon was subsequently convicted by a jury in 2022 of the rarely prosecuted crime of contempt of Congress. Bannon refused to cooperate with subpoenas from the committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection when Democrats controlled Congress. After delays, Bannon must begin serving a four-month prison sentence starting next month. While Bannon was not part of Trump\u2019s official world for most of his presidential term, he is influential on the far right. Appearing later at the Turning Point Action event, Trump described Bannon as a \u201csmart cookie\u201d and told the crowd he tries to watch Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d broadcast whenever he can. Ousted from White House role in 2017 Bannon\u2019s tenure in Trump\u2019s White House was relatively short; he was fired in August 2017, part of a major reorganization under then-chief of staff John Kelly, who was brought in to control a chaotic atmosphere. In the years since, Bannon has continued to advocate for Trump \u2013 and Kelly, a retired general, has sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s possible reelection. Bannon, meanwhile, now sounds like a more militant version of Trump, such as when he emphatically accuses Trump\u2019s opponents of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. There\u2019s no evidence for any kind of mass voter fraud, but that will not end this conspiracy theory. \u201cIf they steal this election \u2013 and they fully intend to steal it \u2013 this republic ends,\u201d Bannon said, before going on a riff about how top Department of Justice officials in President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, like Attorney General Merrick Garland, should be prosecuted; the FBI should be completely deconstructed; and anyone convicted in connection to the storming of the Capitol building would be set free. \u2018Purge\u2019 the DOJ, end the FBI \u201cWe are going to purge DOJ. We are going to take apart the FBI. The FBI, the American Gestapo \u2026 there\u2019s not going to be an FBI,\u201d he said. While Trump has only said he would be justified in going after political opponents, Bannon is committed to targeting anyone he views as having opposed Trump. \u201cWe are going to get every single receipt, and to the fullest extension of the law, you are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d he said. Preparing for a second term It is clear Bannon is looking well past Election Day as he rattled off a list of priorities for the MAGA movement. These included cutting off funding to Ukraine, massive cuts to government spending, beginning the process of ending the Federal Reserve, sealing the southern border, deporting 10 million to 15 million people and taking apart the administrative state. As chief strategist at the White House, Bannon was known for large whiteboards full of lists of priorities \u2013 things that still ring true in the priorities he outlined over the weekend. Courts, Congress and mismanagement kept Bannon and Trump from achieving many of these goals in Trump\u2019s first term. Clearly, Bannon is hoping for more success in a round two, particularly since the moderating forces of people like Kelly are unlikely to be involved in the administration. Bannon is not alone in planning for drastic changes if Trump wins in November. Anticipating the potential for a second Trump term, there are any number of supporters who are mapping out how to make the most of it. The conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, for instance, has written up its Project 2025 road map to remaking the civil service by firing large numbers of career servants and replacing them with more political voices. For a good, in-depth look at what Project 2025 would and would not do, listen this recent \u201cIn the Room\u201d podcast from Peter Bergen, CNN\u2019s national security analyst. Bergen talks to one of the authors of the State Department portion of Project 2025. Those plans from groups like Heritage, while plenty scary to an entire class of civil servants, sound relatively anodyne compared with Bannon\u2019s language. \u201cAre you prepared to fight? Are you prepared to give it all?\u201d he asked of young activists, telling them they would have to follow in the footsteps of \u201cthe team around President Trump\u201d \u2013 who he views as Roger Stone, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Alex Jones, people whose fidelity to conspiracy theories has gotten them into legal and financial trouble, but who in Bannon\u2019s mind are political freedom fighters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/bannon-trump-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-legal-challenges-rfk-jr-ballot", "text": "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushes to gain ballot access in all 50 states, Democrats are ramping up their efforts to block\u00a0the independent presidential candidate by filing legal challenges\u00a0seeking to get his ballot petitions thrown out\u00a0in several states. The Democratic National Committee and Clear Choice PAC, a super PAC backing President Joe Biden that is focused on countering third party candidates, have objected to Kennedy\u2019s ballot access in four states in the last month. Some of those challenges have been filed in key battleground states such as North Carolina and Nevada, while others are focused on his petitions in traditionally Democratic strongholds. Each of the filings claims Kennedy violated state laws that stipulate how independent candidates\u00a0assemble the paperwork needed to qualify for a state\u2019s ballot. Democrats are alleging Kennedy\u2019s campaign misled voters to sign their petitions, improperly formed a minor party to ease ballot qualification and committed procedural errors in its petitions across five states. The challenges mark an escalation of a broader strategy launched by Democrats earlier this year to combat Kennedy\u2019s campaign in hopes of keeping the support of voters who backed Biden in 2020 but may consider Kennedy in November, potentially tilting the outcome of an election that\u2019s expected to be decided by narrow margins. \u201cThese challenges are important because they\u2019re part of a twofold strategy. One is educating voters about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,\u201d\u00a0DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said.\u00a0\u201cAnd the second part is making sure that everyone\u2019s playing by the rules.\u201d Following an event in Albuquerque, New Mexico, last week, Kennedy dismissed the claims made by Democrats and projected confidence he\u2019d overcome the challenges. \u201cThe objections are frivolous, and every case that we brought to court we\u2019ve won easily and will continue to,\u201d Kennedy told CNN. Ramsey Reid, the campaign manager for the DNC\u2019s third-party team, said the DNC is working with lawyers across the country to review\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s petitions in every state and search\u00a0for violations of local petition filing laws. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic review of the filings to make sure that they\u2019re following the rules, the rules that everyone else has to play by. It\u2019s very simple, nitty gritty, election law work to look at the dates, look at the details, look at the actual signatures and make sure that they meet the requirements that state laws set out,\u201d Reid said. The DNC formed its team to combat third-party candidates earlier this year, around the same time a team of Biden allies formed Clear Choice. Until recently, both groups have primarily focused on messaging against third party candidates, particularly Kennedy. The DNC has frequently launched billboards outside Kennedy campaign events labeling him a \u201cspoiler.\u201d But the legal challenges raise the stakes of the Democrats\u2019 campaign to block Kennedy as they seek to solidify Biden\u2019s coalition heading into November, with more objections expected as the independent candidate\u00a0submits petitions in additional states. \u201cAnywhere he\u2019s not following the rules, we\u2019re going to be in a position to hold him accountable to it,\u201d Reid said. The Kennedy campaign has strategically timed submitting signatures in some states to reduce the possibility of legal challenges, which could jeopardize his ballot access if successful. Kennedy \u2014\u00a0who first launched a primary challenge to Biden last year before dropping that bid and starting his independent campaign \u2013 has been harshly critical of the Democrats\u2019 opposition to his candidacy, suggesting the effort to keep him off the ballot makes the election less fair. \u201cThe Democratic Party is doing everything it can to disenfranchise people and make sure that people can vote for who they want to using litigation,\u201d Kennedy said in a Fox News interview in March. But Democrats defend their filings against Kennedy\u2019s ballot qualification as a function of the political system working as intended. Matt Bennett, executive vice president at Third Way, a Biden-allied group opposing third-party candidates, argued Democrats have as much of a right to challenge Kennedy as he does to run for office. \u201cThe first mission of a third-party campaign is to get your candidate on the ballot. If he thinks he can do that, well, go ahead and try. But Democrats and our allies are fully within our rights to challenge that,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cAnd if he wins, then he\u2019s on the ballot, and if he loses, he\u2019s not. That is the American system. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d Both the DNC and Clear Choice have filed legal challenges this year to ballot access petitions from other third-party candidates such as independent candidate Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. But Kennedy holds a uniquely significant amount of public support for a third-party candidate. In a Fox News national poll of registered voters released Wednesday, Kennedy received 10%, outpacing both West and Stein, who earned 2% support each. In that same poll, Biden earned 43% support, while Trump earned 42%. In a head-to-head matchup between Biden and Trump, the same Fox News poll found Biden with 50% support and Trump with 48%. The margin of error for the Fox News survey is 3%. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in seven states: Michigan, California, Utah, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Delaware and Tennessee. He\u2019s repeatedly pledged to qualify for the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, DC. Ballot access is viewed as a major hurdle for most independent candidates because of the time and resources required to track deadlines, follow state laws and properly file paperwork with each state. Last month, Kennedy\u2019s campaign brought in\u00a0$2.6 million\u00a0but spent $6.3 million, more than double what it raised, according to federal campaign finance records. The campaign paid approximately $2.7 million to one ballot access consulting firm, Accelevate 2020 LLC. Legal battles with the DNC could put additional pressure on the Kennedy campaign\u2019s resources. Legal challenges The Democrats\u2019 latest challenge was filed in Delaware, a blue state where Kennedy qualified for the ballot earlier this year after being nominated by the Independent Party. The objection, previously unreported, centers on discrepancies in the timing of the party nominating Kennedy and filing paperwork with the state. The Independent Party stated it nominated Kennedy and his running mate Nicole Shanahan on January 23, according to a copy of the nominating paperwork reviewed by CNN, approximately two months before Shanahan was announced as Kennedy\u2019s vice presidential pick. In a letter obtained by CNN, an attorney representing the Delaware Democratic Party asked Delaware Election Commissioner Anthony Albence to block the certification of Kennedy and Shanahan or any Independent Party candidate in the state. On Friday, Democrats also organized a lawsuit in Nevada, a crucial battleground state, arguing that because Kennedy accepted nominations of minor parties in some states where he\u2019s gained ballot access, he is ineligible to run as an independent candidate in Nevada. Earlier this month, the DNC helped two New York voters file objections with the New York State Board of Election and a separate lawsuit seeking to\u00a0void Kennedy\u2019s ballot access petition, claiming Kennedy\u2019s petition is \u201cpermeated with fraud.\u201d Some of the objections claim procedural violations, including missing dates, improperly numbered pages, and forms completed not in blue or black ink. But Democrats are also alleging signature gatherers working for Kennedy\u2019s campaign \u201cknowingly and intentionally misrepresented and/or concealed\u201d his\u00a0and Shanahan\u2019s names on ballot petitions. The allegations of misleading voters appear to have some standing. In a separate lawsuit filed by the Kennedy campaign\u00a0challenging ballot access requirements\u00a0in New York,\u00a0the independent candidate\u2019s team acknowledged hiring two petitioning firms in New York who then folded over the tops of Kennedy\u2019s petitions to hide Kennedy and Shanahan\u2019s names. Kennedy\u2019s campaign did not submit any signatures collected by the two firms, according to the lawsuit. Jeffrey Wice, a New York University professor specializing in election law, said some of\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s petition signatures could get thrown out because of New York\u2019s unique ballot access laws that pose obstacles especially for third-party candidates. \u201cIt could very well be a legitimate claim because New York has very specific requirements on what goes on the petitions in terms of the signature and the address of the voter,\u201d Wice said. \u201cNew York has a very complicated election system. These laws were designed, essentially, decades back to help incumbents stay in office,\u201d he added. The DNC\u2019s efforts to block Kennedy\u2019s ballot access are aided by Clear Choice.\u00a0The PAC\u00a0has also filed an objection in New York that home in on questions around Kennedy\u2019s listed residence.\u00a0His New York petitions listed an address in Katonah, New York, as his residence, despite being based primarily in Los Angeles. Kennedy has previously denied reports that he doesn\u2019t live at the Katonah\u00a0residence. Clear Choice has also filed an objection to Kennedy\u2019s ballot petition in battleground North Carolina earlier this month, arguing that the We The People party,\u00a0which was formed by Kennedy\u2019s campaign, wrongly circumvents state laws governing political parties by being tied to Kennedy\u2019s campaign. Clear Choice also argues an incorrect residence listed by a We The People party official could potentially invalidate several pages of Kennedy\u2019s signatures. The Kennedy campaign has shown some success in fighting for ballot access in the courtroom already. After Democrats objected to the Kennedy campaign\u2019s formation of the We The People party in Hawaii, Kennedy campaign staffers successfully defended the formation of the\u00a0party in a state elections office hearing, ensuring ballot access in the state. Kennedy\u2019s lawyers have used lawsuits in multiple states to successfully push back petition deadlines, including in Utah, where Kennedy has qualified for the ballot. But Democrats insist they will continue to fight Kennedy\u2019s petitions in court, further complicating Kennedy\u2019s path to nationwide ballot access.\u00a0The lawsuits, Democrats acknowledge, are an indication of the potential impact Kennedy could have on the race in states where he does make the ballot. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit on our hands and leave opponents unchecked, though. We\u2019ve seen in past elections what happens when you don\u2019t take threats seriously,\u201d Corridoni said. \u201cWe view Robert F. Kennedy on the ballot as a threat to stopping President Biden winning reelection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-legal-challenges-rfk-jr-ballot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_trump-gag-order-prosecutors-classified-documents", "text": "Prosecutors on the federal classified documents case, in stark and terse terms, put forward once again their case for a new gag order against Donald Trump in an effort to limit what he can say about agents involved in a search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022. On Monday, the federal judge overseeing the case will hold a hearing for both parties to present their arguments over the proposed gag order, and tensions between the two sides could quickly rise. Citing Trump\u2019s continued mischaracterization of the FBI\u2019s\u00a0policy in place around the\u00a0use of deadly force during the search, prosecutors say Trump\u2019s false claims that he nearly escaped death from federal agents could lead to threats and harassment against them. Trump was in New York when agents searched the Florida estate. To support this concern, prosecutors, in a filing Friday evening, cited two examples of the type of threats and violence they believe could result from Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cShortly after the execution of the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, one of Trump\u2019s supporters carried out an armed attack on an FBI office in the wake of Trump\u2019s Truth Social statements regarding the search,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cAnd just last week, a supporter of Trump called an FBI agent associated with the Hunter Biden case and claimed that, if Trump wins reelection, FBI agents will be thrown in jail; and if he does not win, the agents will be \u2018hunt[ed] down\u2019 and \u2018slaughter[ed]\u2019 In their own homes, after which \u2018[w]e\u2019re going to slaughter your whole f****** family.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys have called the proposed gag order a direct attack on Trump\u2019s First Amendment rights and say prosecutors have not given an example of agents being harassed as a result of his recent comments. In their response on Friday, prosecutors wrote that \u201cwhile Trump boastfully acknowledges the impact that his words have on his listeners, he will just as predictably decline any responsibility for their actions should any further violence take place. Neither the Government nor the Court has that luxury.\u201d Prosecutors also addressed a defense attorney\u2019s claim that special counsel Jack Smith was trying to thwart Trump\u2019s ability to campaign in the lead up to the November election. \u201c(T)he Government has absolutely no interest in those matters. None,\u201d prosecutors wrote. They added: \u201cIndeed, Trump has released a torrent of criticisms of the Biden Administration and the Department of Justice, and the Government has made no motion to this Court to limit or address such comments in any way. Trump is welcome to make such comments to his heart\u2019s content \u2014 they are simply not the Government\u2019s concern.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/trump-gag-order-prosecutors-classified-documents/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Andrew Miller\u00a0who currently runs\u00a0the Israeli and Palestinian portfolio at the department\u00a0is leaving his role for personal reasons, sources familiar with his departure told CNN. His departure comes as the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration is growing considerably more frustrated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and how Israel is conducting the war, while also continuing to defend\u00a0the country\u00a0on the international stage. Miller has told State Department leadership he plans to leave at the end of June because he feels burned out and would like to spend more time with his wife and young daughter,\u00a0sources said. \u201cAndrew brought deep experience and sharp perspective to the table every day. Everyone here is sorry to see him go, but we wish him well in his next endeavors,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. The Washington Post first reported Miller\u2019s departure. Miller has deep expertise on the region,\u00a0included having served as the Director for Egypt and Israel Military Issues at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. There\u00a0have been\u00a0about a dozen\u00a0US government employees who\u00a0have\u00a0publicly\u00a0resigned\u00a0in protest over how the war is being handled\u00a0but Miller is not believed to be leaving because he is unhappy with the administration\u2019s approach. Most recently Stacy\u00a0Gilbert, a career diplomat at the State Department with more than two decades of experience, told CNN she resigned in protest of the administration\u2019s report that said Israel was not impeding the delivery of humanitarian support to Gaza. She had been working on the highly anticipated report and said that \u201cat some point, the subject matter experts who were working on that report were removed, it was moved up to a higher level.\u201d Miller brought\u00a0extensive experience to a role that became exponentially more sensitive and complex after Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. He played a central role in the Biden administration\u2019s executive order issued in February that has resulted in sanctions imposed against individuals and groups involved in settler violence in the West Bank. He led efforts for equal treatment for Palestinian-Americans in the visa waiver program for Israelis. Miller also played a key role helping the mother and uncle of an American service member escape from Gaza during the war. Miller joined the Biden administration from the start, first at the US mission at the United Nations and then as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. He advised Biden\u2019s transition team on Middle East affairs and during that time had a mild heart attack.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_takeaways-supreme-court-rahimi-guns-domestic-violence", "text": "The Supreme Court handed down its most significant gun control ruling in two years on Friday, upholding a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from owning weapons. With conservatives and liberals joining the 8-1 majority, the decision was a major win for gun safety groups and victims of domestic violence. It limited a controversial standard the high court\u2019s\u00a0conservatives had set down in 2022 that required gun prohibitions to have a connection to history to survive constitutional scrutiny. But the majority opinion from Chief Justice John Roberts also left unanswered key questions about when the government may disarm non-violent criminals. The case centered on a 1994 law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was convicted for violating that law following a series of shootings. Here\u2019s a look at some key takeaways from the decision. Looking to history with guns Two years ago, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court said that to survive a challenge, gun laws must have some connection to the nation\u2019s history and tradition. That sent lower courts scurrying into historical analyses to figure out if modern gun laws had some connection to the 18th Century. But Friday, the majority said that lower courts don\u2019t have to identify exact replicas of a historic law in order to uphold modern gun restrictions. It\u2019s enough to be in the ballpark. \u201cWhen an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed,\u201d Roberts wrote. The law at issue in the case \u201cis by no means identical to these founding era regimes, but it does not need to be. Its prohibition on the possession of firearms by those found by a court to present a threat to others fits neatly within the tradition\u201d of historic laws. Conservatives tinkering with test While the decision was 8-1, the fact that there were five concurrences \u2013 three by conservative Donald Trump-appointed justices who had previously signed on to the Bruen opinion \u2013 shows that the court\u2019s conservative wing is still tinkering with the test that was laid out in two years ago. Roberts\u2019 opinion said that lower courts were misunderstanding what the majority had said in that ruling. But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, suggested it was the high court\u2019s fault for not providing clarity for lower courts to follow. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were nominated by\u00a0Trump, were defensive of Bruen, with each emphasizing that a historical approach is preferable to what they described as a \u201cpolicy\u201d-based approach that lower courts had been taking to gun laws in the past. Prior to Bruen, courts often engaged in a test that balanced a government\u2019s public safety goals against the claimed infringement\u00a0on the Second Amendment right. Kavanaugh spent several pages laying out how courts should weigh historical examples of gun laws from the pre-founding era to ones that were passed after the Constitution was ratified, while asserting that the \u201cfirst stop\u201d should be looking at the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative who has been raising concerns about the Supreme Court\u2019s approach on history in recent cases, penned a brief concurrence criticizing how some lower courts were looking for near-identical historical gun laws when examining modern regulations. \u201cImposing a test that demands overly specific analogues has serious problems,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cIt forces 21st-century regulations to follow late-18th-century policy choices, giving us \u2018a law trapped in amber.\u2019\u201d Thomas\u2019 lone dissent As the court\u2019s majority sought to rein in some of the confusion created by\u00a0Bruen, Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of that opinion, was left by himself to deliver a forceful defense of the court\u2019s ruling in 2022. The history and tradition test Thomas put forth in that opinion paved the way for Rahimi\u2019s victory at a lower court while also perplexing some jurists who saw it as an unworkable framework for examining the nation\u2019s gun laws. The conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that Bruen required a similar law in the nation\u2019s history and that, without it, the prohibition must fall. But on Friday, Thomas said the \u201ccourt\u2019s directive was clear\u201d in Bruen: Gun laws need to be \u201cconsistent with the nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation\u201d to withstand legal scrutiny. The law Rahimi\u2019s case, he wrote, would fall under that framework. Thomas\u00a0said that the government had failed to point to \u201claws before, during, and after our nation\u2019s founding\u201d that were similar to the one the court upheld Friday. Rahimi, Thomas said, \u201cis a member of the political community, (who) falls within the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee.\u201d \u201cThe question is whether the government can strip the Second Amendment right of anyone subject to a protective order \u2013 even if he has never been accused or convicted of a crime,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cIt cannot.\u201d How the decision affects Hunter Biden By focusing on Rahimi\u2019s \u201cdangerous\u201d conduct, the high court did not foreclose a series of other challenges to federal disarmament laws already pending at the Supreme Court, including one related to Hunter Biden\u2019s felony gun case. One of those cases that has been appealed to the justices centers on a Mississippi man who is challenging\u00a0a federal law that makes it a crime to own a weapon while being an \u201cunlawful user of or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs. The 5th Circuit sided with the man last August, saying the nation\u2019s history and tradition did not support that restriction. What the high court ultimately does with that case will be closely watched because it is the same law at issue in\u00a0Biden\u2019s gun case in Delaware. Biden has already raised the 5th Circuit case, US v. Daniels, in an attempt to throw out his own case. The judge who oversaw his trial denied that effort and Biden was later convicted of violating that law and two other federal firearms laws. His lawyers are expected to mount another challenge to the constitutionality of the law in a post-conviction appeal. Friday\u2019s opinion did not \u201cdoom\u201d Biden\u2019s challenge, said Steve Vladeck,\u00a0CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, but it did not appear to \u201cmaterially assist\u201d the arguments that the president\u2019s son is making. The fact that the ruling was an 8-1 decision shows that, in some ways, it was the easiest kind of case the Roberts court could encounter under the Bruen test handed down two years ago. The justices were convinced that the federal ban on alleged domestic abusers possessing guns survived Rahimi\u2019s challenge because there were historical analogues in Founding-era gun laws that targeted \u201cdangerous\u201d conduct. Other gun challenges on the way In addition to the Daniels case, the high court is juggling several other potentially significant Second Amendment cases. One deals with a Pennsylvania man\u2019s challenge to a federal law prohibiting felons, including those who are non-violent, from possessing firearms. The man at the center of that case was convicted of welfare fraud after he lied on a form to obtain food stamps. The majority rejected an argument raised by the Biden administration that people who are not \u201cresponsible\u201d could also be barred from owning guns. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar presented that argument with an eye toward several other challenges pending to similar federal gun prohibitions that involve non-violent criminal activity. But Roberts wrote that \u201cresponsible\u201d is a vague term and that the \u201cquestion was simply not presented.\u201d Other cases waiting in the wings at the high court deal with challenges to Illinois\u2019 ban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d and New York\u2019s regulations on carrying concealed firearms. The court may decide in the coming days if it will hear oral arguments in those cases.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/takeaways-supreme-court-rahimi-guns-domestic-violence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_student-loan-relief-federal-budget-deficit", "text": "The federal budget deficit will hit $1.9 trillion this fiscal year, according to an updated projection released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. That\u2019s 27% \u2013 or $400 billion \u2013 larger than the agency estimated in February. Looking longer term, the nation\u2019s debt will approach $57 trillion in fiscal year 2034, nearly $2.5 trillion higher than previously projected, as spending on Social Security, Medicare and interest payments soar and revenues fail to keep pace. The growing imbalance is expected to loom large over upcoming congressional budget and tax battles. Most of the spike in the fiscal 2024 deficit stems from four factors that are expected to boost projected spending. The largest is a $145 billion increase that\u2019s partly due to changes the Biden administration made to student loan repayment plans and a new, proposed forgiveness program that would waive some accrued interest for millions of borrowers. The latter has yet to be finalized but could take effect as soon as this fall. Also, the CBO increased the projected outlays for deposit insurance by about $70 billion because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is not recovering disbursements it made when resolving five bank failures from the last fiscal year and this fiscal year as quickly as anticipated. Three of the five bank failures in 2023 were among the\u00a0largest bank failures in US history. To replenish the multibillion-dollar hit\u00a0to the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund due to recent bank failures, the agency is temporarily levying higher fees on hundreds of insured banks and selling off failed banks\u2019 assets. Newly enacted legislation is increasing projected discretionary spending by $60 billion, and estimated spending on Medicaid is about $50 billion higher because actual outlays so far in fiscal year 2024 have been larger than expected. The fiscal year began on October 1. The cumulative deficit over the 2025 to 2034 period is now projected to be 10% \u2013 or $2.1 trillion \u2013 larger, the CBO said. The nation\u2019s ballooning budget deficits remain in the spotlight in this year\u2019s presidential election, as presumptive nominees President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both promise to improve the nation\u2019s fiscal status \u2013 but in very different ways. Also, the imbalance between federal spending and tax revenue will factor heavily into Congress\u2019 coming discussions on the fiscal year 2025 budget, the return of the debt ceiling in January, and the expiration of many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of next year. More than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025. Add in some corporate tax changes and interest, and the impact on the deficit swells to $4.6 trillion, according to a separate CBO analysis. Though continuing the tax cuts will increase the deficit, Congress is not expected to allow all of them to expire. Trump and Republican lawmakers have said they want to extend them all, while Biden and Democratic lawmakers are calling for raising taxes on corporations and those earning more than $400,000 a year. After adjusting to exclude timing shifts of certain payments, the CBO projects the deficit will be $2 trillion in fiscal year 2024 and grow to $2.8 trillion by fiscal year 2034. In relation to economic output, federal debt held by the public will rise from 99% this fiscal year to 122% in fiscal year 2034, surpassing its historical peak, the agency said. \u201cCBO\u2019s new report shows that the outlook for America\u2019s critical national debt challenge is worsening,\u201d Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an important time for a national conversation on these critical fiscal and economic challenges that we must address next year, and beyond.\u201d Immigration helps lower the deficit One bright spot in the CBO report is that the recent surge in immigration is expected to lower deficits by a net total of $0.9 trillion over the 2024 to 2034 period. The agency looked at an immigration category that includes people who entered the US illegally and have not obtained permanent legal status, people who entered lawfully through the use of parole authority and who may be awaiting proceedings in an immigration court and people who had temporary legal status but remained in the country after it expired. The CBO estimates that net immigration of people in this category will total 2.4 million in 2024 and decline in subsequent years. Between 2021 and 2026, the agency projects the number of these immigrants will be 8.7 million greater than it would have been had net immigration remained at its expected level. However, it warns that these projections are subject to \u201cmuch uncertainty.\u201d The surge is expected to boost revenues by about $1.2 trillion over the coming decade, mostly because the immigrants will pay income and payroll taxes on their earnings, the agency projects. It estimates that about half the immigrants in the surge will be authorized for work and notes that people without work permits will pay some taxes, though they are less likely to do so. Plus, the increase in immigration will lead to more economic activity, which will broadly boost income and tax revenues, the agency forecasts. Uninsured rate expected to rise The nation\u2019s uninsured rate hit an all-time low of 7.2% last year, but that figure is expected to rise to 8.9% in 2034, under a separate CBO analysis released Tuesday. The increase is mainly due to the end of a Covid-19 pandemic provision that barred states from disenrolling Medicaid enrollees until 2023, the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies at the end of 2025 and the surge in the number of immigrants, who are much more likely to be uninsured. The largest increase in the uninsured will be among adults ages 19 to 44, the agency estimates. Medicare enrollment is expected to swell from 61 million this year to 74 million in 2034, as the population ages. The number of people with Medicaid coverage is projected to drop from 92 million last year to about 79 million in coming years as a result of the end of the pandemic-era protection. Affordable Care Act enrollment is forecast to hit an all-time high of 23 million people next year and then fall to 16 million in 2034. Permanently extending the subsidies beyond 2025 would increase individual market coverage (both on and off the Obamacare exchanges) by 7.1 million, according to a third CBO report. The CBO\u2019s health insurance coverage projections will not be welcome news for the Biden campaign. The president has repeatedly touted the expansion of health insurance coverage during his administration. Congressional Democrats are hoping to extend the enhanced subsidies as part of negotiations over extending the 2017 tax cuts. This story has been updated with additional information.

The move uses relatively new Commerce Department authorities built on executive orders signed by Presidents\u00a0Joe Biden and Donald Trump to ban the sale and provision of software products by\u00a0Russian\u00a0firm,\u00a0Kaspersky\u00a0Lab,\u00a0inside the US. Previously installed software from the company can continue to be used but it will not be possible to download updates. Thursday\u2019s announcement comes after CNN reported in April that the Biden administration was preparing to issue an order that would\u202fprevent US companies and citizens from using Kaspersky software. \u201cWe are announcing that after an extremely thorough investigation, we are taking action \u2026 which will prohibit Kaspersky Lab and all of its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent company from providing cyber security and anti-virus software anywhere in the United States,\u201d Raimondo told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re also adding three Kaspersky entities to the Entity List, which means that they won\u2019t be able to sell or update software in the US,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u201cRussia has shown it has the capacity and even more than that, the intent, to exploit Russian companies like\u00a0Kaspersky\u00a0to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans\u00a0and that\u2019s why we are compelled to take the action that we\u2019re taking today.\u201d It\u2019s the latest move by the US government to block Americans from using popular technology that it considers a national security risk. \u201cDespite proposing a system in which the security of Kaspersky products could have been independently verified by a trusted\u00a0third party, Kaspersky believes that the Department of Commerce made its decision based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns, rather than on a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky\u2019s products and services,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said in a statement responding to the Commerce ruling. \u201cKaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten\u00a0US\u00a0national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted\u00a0US\u00a0interests and allies.\u00a0The company intends to pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.\u201d Following the Commerce Department announcement, on Friday the US Treasury imposed sanctions on 12 leaders of the firm \u201cfor operating in the technology sector of the Russian Federation economy.\u201d The Treasury Department did not impose sanctions on the company itself, \u201cits parent or subsidiary companies, or its CEO,\u201d the Treasury Department said. \u201cToday\u2019s action against the leadership of Kaspersky Lab underscores our commitment to ensure the integrity of our cyber domain and to protect our citizens against malicious cyber threats,\u201d Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe United States will take action where necessary to hold accountable those who would seek to facilitate or otherwise enable these activities.\u201d US government agencies are already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software,\u00a0but action to prevent private companies from using the software is unprecedented. US officials have for years alleged that the Russian government could force Kaspersky Lab to hand over data or use its anti-virus software\u202fto attempt to carry out\u202fhacking or surveillance of Americans \u2014\u202faccusations that Kaspersky Lab strenuously denies. Raimondo reiterated that concern during Thursday\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve been exploring every option at our disposal, we ultimately decided that given the Russian government\u2019s continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence\u00a0Kaspersky\u2019s\u00a0operations, that we have to take the significant measure of a full prohibition, if we\u2019re going to protect Americans and their personal data,\u201d she told reporters. A Commerce Department official said Thursday that the agency\u2019s final determination implementing the ban does not identify any specific instances in which the Russian government has attempted to exploit Kaspersky or used the company\u2019s software for data collection. \u201cBut we certainly believe that it is more than just a theoretical threat,\u201d the official added, noting the Commerce\u00a0Department\u2019s\u00a0new authorities allow it to act proactively, even in the absence of concrete examples. Founded in Moscow in 1997, Kaspersky Lab grew into one of the world\u2019s most successful anti-virus software companies alongside American rivals like McAfee and Symantec. Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the US and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users. Some of the speculation and suspicion from US officials about the Russian company centers around Eugene Kaspersky, a charismatic computer expert who co-founded Kaspersky Lab in Moscow in 1997. Eugene Kaspersky studied cryptography at a KGB-sponsored university\u202f\u2014 a fact that some\u202fUS lawmakers\u202flike to mention when trying to tie the company to Russian government. Kaspersky Lab has denied having \u201cany unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia.\u201d Kaspersky served as a software engineer at a Russian Ministry of Defense institute after graduation, and that is \u201cthe extent of his military experience,\u201d the\u202fcompany says. Kaspersky has\u202flamented that his company is the victim of geopolitical tensions between the West and Russia \u2014\u202ftensions that have only grown sharper since the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This story has been with updated additional details and comment from Kaspersky Lab.

{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_us-israel-hezbollah-assurances", "text": "Senior US officials reassured a delegation of top Israeli officials visiting Washington this week that if a full-out war were to break out on Israel\u2019s northern border between Israel and Hezbollah, the Biden administration is fully prepared to back its ally, according to a senior administration official. The in-person assurances came as an increase in cross-border attacks in recent weeks between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah have intensified concerns about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged conflict in the Middle East \u2013 and also as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused the US of withholding weapons and ammunition from his country, touching off a tense back-and-forth between Israeli and US officials. Top Israeli officials including\u00a0Minister of Strategic Affairs\u00a0Ron Dermer and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi participated in a series of meetings with Biden administration officials like national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House Middle East affairs coordinator Brett McGurk in Washington this week. They discussed a wide range of topics including the situation on Israel\u2019s northern border, Iran and the ceasefire and hostage negotiations, sources said. When discussing the issue of Hezbollah\u2019s provocations, US officials made clear this week that the Biden administration would offer Israel the security assistance it needs, the senior administration official said, though the US would not deploy American troops to the ground in such a scenario. Since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7, Hezbollah\u2019s provocations against Israel have continued \u2013 and escalated in recent weeks. Biden administration has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to see yet another war break out on Israel\u2019s northern front, urging diplomatic de-escalation. This week, US envoy Amos Hochstein was dispatched to the region to try to help de-escalate the conflict. Still, with Hezbollah\u2019s attacks across the border into Israel continuing in the absence of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, US officials are on heightened alert about the eruption of a full-blown conflict in the region. If Hezbollah were to significantly expand the scale of its attacks on Israel, resulting in the deaths of Israelis, US officials expect Israel to respond with full force. As CNN reported, US officials have serious concerns\u00a0that in the event of a full-blown war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defenses\u00a0in the north \u2014 including the much-vaunted\u00a0Iron Dome\u00a0air defense system. That reality would make the US\u2019 full support of Israel all the more critical. In this week\u2019s meetings, US and Israeli officials discussed possible \u201coff-ramps\u201d to try to lower the temperature along the so-called Blue Line that separates Lebanon and Israel, the senior administration official said. Those talks touched on ways of returning Israelis and Lebanese people who have been displaced from the border back to their homes, they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/us-israel-hezbollah-assurances/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_trump-running-mate-vp-rubio-vance-burgum", "text": "As former President Donald Trump narrows his focus on a handful of potential running mates, the behind-the-scenes lobbying among close advisers and donors has intensified with sharp divisions emerging over who is best suited to join the ticket. In every corner of Trump\u2019s orbit \u2013 from his family and conservative media figures to former advisers and donors \u2013 people are trying to get in the president\u2019s ear before he finalizes a pick, several people close to the former president tell CNN. His oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has made his affinity for Sen. J.D. Vance well known, hosting the Ohio Republican on his web show and pushing him in conversations with his father. Rupert Murdoch has urged Trumpworld to consider North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum while\u00a0showering the little-known Republican with friendly coverage in the conservative mogul\u2019s media empire. Meanwhile, one of Murdoch\u2019s stars, Fox News host Sean Hannity, has gone to bat for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, arguing the son of Cuban immigrants could help Trump with\u00a0Latino\u00a0voters in key battlegrounds. The shadow campaigning in the veepstakes has become increasingly urgent. There is less than a month until the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee \u2014 the deadline Trump has set to announce his nominee for vice president \u2014 and internal conversations regarding who the former president will ultimately pick have entered a new phase. Vetting of the candidates has commenced, advisers have built pros and cons lists and Trump himself has taken on a more serious and earnest approach to determining who he envisions is best fit to serve alongside him, Trump\u2019s advisers and people close to the former president say. Trump\u2019s campaign insists the former president is his own best adviser and he alone will make the call. His shortlist remains in flux, his advisers caution, noting that the former president is liable to change his mind until the moment\u00a0he\u00a0formally announces his pick. While Vance, Burgum and Rubio are currently considered the three leading choices, other Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, House GOP conference Chair Elise Stefanik, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson have all received various levels of vetting paperwork and are still under some consideration. One senior Trump adviser put it this way: \u201cTheir standing really depends on the day, who he speaks with and who he sees on TV.\u201d One bundler\u00a0for the former president suggested Trump is least likely to listen to people who have a clear bias. Indeed, Trump\u2019s top lieutenants, including\u00a0campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, have made it a point not to weigh in, multiple people told CNN. \u201cWhen Trump asks people their opinion, those folks campaigning for someone, he tunes them out,\u201d the bundler said. \u201cIf he cares about and respects your opinion, he will ask you.\u201d A person close to Trump added that Wiles in particular is wary of pushing for a single candidate \u2014 noting that her posturing has set the tone for the team. \u201cSusie has lasted this long because she provides information that will be helpful, and then lets Trump make the decision,\u201d the person said. A senior Trump adviser insisted,\u00a0\u201cNobody in this campaign is lobbying or pushing anyone above anyone else.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s been very clear about the primary focus of his choice being a person that he believes would have a great eight years of service after his next four year term,\u201d the adviser added. Dinner party straw poll win for Rubio At a dinner in New York City following his felony conviction, Trump canvassed some two dozen Wall Street financiers and high-dollar donors to get their views on who he should pick, according to two attendees. As he went one-by-one around the rectangular table, no clear consensus emerged. Trump scowled when one attendee suggested Trump pick his onetime Cabinet member and recent primary challenger,\u00a0former South Carolina Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley. The crowd was perplexed when another suggested a write-in candidate with no name recognition from academia. Vance and Burgum, according to attendees, received a few mentions. And at least two attendees supported Scott. Rubio received the most votes in the informal straw poll, with many backers citing a key reason: The 53-year-old\u2019s ability to assume the office of the presidency if something were to happen to their 78-year-old nominee. In Rubio, they said, Trump would also get a seasoned lawmaker with the ability to bolster\u00a0the former president\u2019s\u00a0Latino support \u2014 especially in Nevada, where\u00a0the senator\u00a0once lived \u2014 and provide his administration a bit of polish. Besides Hannity and Trump\u2019s dinner company, Rubio has another influential figure in his corner: Kellyanne Conway. Trump\u2019s former 2016 campaign manager played a key role in the selection of then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence eight years ago and she continues to advise the campaign on issues relating to abortion policy and debate preparations. Conway and Trump have met regularly over dinners on the patio at Mar-a-Lago over the past year, conversations in which Conway has made her case for Rubio to be considered a top contender, multiple sources familiar with the talks said. Hannity did not respond to a request for comment. Though Conway declined to affirm her preference for Rubio, she told CNN that Trump should pick someone \u201cwho can help him win, help him govern, who can be ready on day one.\u201d She has also taken her arguments more public. For months, Conway has been outwardly arguing for Trump to consider a running mate who could help him make gains with non-White voters. In an\u00a0April\u00a0interview with The Washington Post, she said, \u201cif he has a Marco Rubio or a Byron Donalds, a Ben Carson, certainly a Tim Scott on the ticket, that could obviously help in what is already happening, which is a migration away from the Democratic Party by some of its core constituents over to President Trump in some of the major polls.\u201d Conway also mentioned Rubio three times in a February op-ed for The New York Times pontificating on Trump\u2019s selection process. She namechecked\u00a0Donalds\u00a0and Scott in that piece as well. Conway has also privately told Trump and other members of his inner circle that she thinks Scott would make a good VP, but those close to Trump argue she touts Rubio more frequently. Scott on Wednesday held a summit in Washington\u00a0featuring Conway along with wealthy donors such as Marc Andreessen, Brian Hook and Bill Ackman \u2014 though not all of them are pushing Scott as VP. One of the donors, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin,\u00a0recently said\u00a0he was \u201cgoing to wait to see who\u00a0(Trump)\u00a0picks as his VP candidate\u201d before deciding whether to contribute to\u00a0the former president\u2019s\u00a0third White House bid \u2013 yet another example of how key voices are trying to influence the decision. Griffin, who owns a home in South Florida and in recent years relocated his firm Citadel to Miami, backed Rubio\u2019s unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid. A vocal Trump skeptic, he\u00a0gave\u00a0$5 million to super PACs backing\u00a0Haley\u00a0this cycle, before she exited the race. From \u2018Hillbilly Elegy\u2019 to far-right favorite While Rubio may have support within the donor class, influential voices among Trump\u2019s far-right base have gravitated toward Vance. The freshman senator is a regular on the War Room podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, the former Trump adviser headed to prison next month for contempt of Congress. Bannon\u00a0in an interview with Politico\u00a0earlier this year said Vance and his political operation were at the \u201cnerve center\u201d of Trump\u2019s movement and suggested the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d\u00a0author could be the St. Paul to Trump\u2019s Jesus. \u201cYou know, Jesus played the small rooms until St. Paul came around,\u201d Bannon told the outlet. \u201cIt took the zeal of St. Paul to turn Jesus into a headliner.\u201d Bannon has also been a fierce defender of Vance behind the scenes, and confirmed to CNN that he has privately pushed Vance to Trump\u2019s allies. Trump Jr., who helped to rally support around Vance\u2019s Senate bid\u00a0in 2022\u00a0during a contested GOP primary, has made clear his preference for his father\u2019s running mate. \u201cI\u2019d love to see a J.D. Vance,\u201d Trump Jr. told Newsmax in January. \u201cYou actually need a fighter.\u201d Tucker Carlson, the exiled Fox News commentator who now hosts his own podcast, has privately urged Trump to consider Vance as well, two sources familiar with the conversations told CNN. In an interview with Politico,\u00a0Carlson, a close friend of\u00a0Trump\u00a0Jr., called Vance\u00a0\u201cby far the smartest and the deepest of any (senator) I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Attempts by CNN to reach Carlson were unsuccessful. The lesser known governor To the surprise of some, Burgum remains in the mix, though many Trump allies often remark it\u2019s clear the wealthy North Dakota governor looks the part.\u00a0Trump\u00a0once bluntly referred to Pence as \u201cstraight out of central casting\u201d \u2014 and it appears Burgum has that going for him this time. He also has benefited from a wave of positive publicity from Murdoch\u2019s news empire, which has heaped praise on the former businessman-turned-red state executive. Burgum ran a software company and a real estate development firm in his home state of North Dakota. His wealth from his private sector success helped bankroll his failed campaign for the Republican nomination against Trump\u00a0this cycle. A June New York Post editorial ran with the headline \u201cGov. Doug Burgum is Trump\u2019s best choice for VP, but Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s a strong runner-up.\u201d In May, the Wall Street Journal editorial board argued for Trump to consider a few \u201coutside-the-Beltway\u201d options. Burgum, the board wrote, \u201cwould be an adult in White House councils.\u201d \u201cHe was a success as an entrepreneur and understands markets and global economic competition,\u201d the piece went on. \u201cHe\u2019s not flashy but Mr. Trump needs mature.\u201d Murdoch\u2019s News Corp did not respond to a request for comment. Though hailing from a small state and largely unknown, Burgum is considered by some in Trump\u2019s orbit as someone who can\u2019t hurt the ticket. That\u2019s a key concern of Trump\u2019s top advisers who have otherwise let the former president dictate the process. \u201cHe should have somebody who\u2019s not a distraction or subtraction and he doesn\u2019t need to be defending the statements of other people,\u201d Conway said. \u201cPresident Trump should not be made to explain other people\u2019s scandals or statements.\u201d Burgum\u2019s wealth may have worked in his favor for a time when Trump trailed President Joe Biden in the money wars. But the recent influx of cash into the campaign following Trump\u2019s fundraising blitz and criminal convictions has blunted that advantage. \u201cThe campaign is exceptionally well-funded,\u201d the bundler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a sugar daddy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/trump-running-mate-vp-rubio-vance-burgum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_paul-whelan-2000-days-russia-custody", "text": "Detained American Paul Whelan marked another grim milestone this week as he surpassed 2,000 days in Russian custody, telling CNN that it was \u201cjust an incredible amount of time\u201d to spend in detention \u201cfor a crime that never occurred\u201d as he urged the Biden administration to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to bring him and fellow detained American Evan Gershkovich home. \u201cWhen you think of 2,000 days, how long that actually is, how many years, how many months, it\u2019s an incredible number,\u201d said Whelan, who called CNN Friday exclusively from his remote prison camp in Mordovia, Russia. \u201cYou go to university to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2013 that\u2019s four years. You\u2019re generally in high school for three or four years. Even people go into the military, and they serve four years. So when you think of five and a half years, it\u2019s just an incredible amount of time,\u201d he said. Whelan, who has been declared wrongfully detained by the US State Department, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges he has consistently and vehemently denied. While he believes that the US government has taken his case seriously, the ex-Marine told CNN that he wants it to take it \u201cmore seriously.\u201d \u201cThere should be decisive action taken,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cThe US needs to go out and do something \u2013 fill up Guantanamo Bay with Russian officials, arrest Russian spies, do something that makes the Kremlin sit up and take notice and say, \u2018Okay, yeah, right, now it\u2019s time that we\u2019re gonna get Evan and Paul back and then we want back what you\u2019ve got of ours, and we\u2019ll call it a day,\u2019\u201d he described. \u201cUntil decisive action is taken, until there\u2019s a strong response to this sort of behavior, they\u2019ll keep grabbing people like Trevor (Reed) and Brittney (Griner) and Evan and others,\u201d he said. A slew of other Americans \u2013 Gordon Black, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Ksenia Karelina \u2013 have been arrested in recent months, but have not been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department. Whelan said he was aware that Gershkovich\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin behind closed doors in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg next week. Gershkovich, who has been declared wrongfully detained, has also been charged with espionage, which he denies. Whelan speculated that \u201cit could be an important milestone in his case, as well as mine\u201d because \u201cthe Russians have generally wanted convictions in these cases, so they can claim legitimacy, regardless of the facts.\u201d \u201cPeople here don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to trial. They don\u2019t say they\u2019re going to seek justice. They say they\u2019re going to get a sentence, they\u2019re going to be sentenced. And that\u2019s it. There is no criminal justice system here. There is no judicial system. It\u2019s just a system that the government has operated for many years, putting people in prison for all sorts of dubious charges and dubious events. And in my case, that\u2019s 100% true, and I\u2019m sure in Evan\u2019s case, it\u2019s 100% true. But people go to trial here and they\u2019re automatically guilty, and then they\u2019re given a sentence, and that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US government \u201cwill continue to work to bring home Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan every day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something that we are constantly working on and constantly pursuing,\u201d he said at a State Department briefing last week. \u201cWe put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said publicly; we\u2019re continuing to work to secure their release. We don\u2019t talk about the details of that publicly, as has always been the case, but it is one of the Secretary and the President\u2019s highest priorities.\u201d A State Department official told CNN Friday that \u201c2,000 days is far too long for Paul to be wrongfully detained in Russia,\u201d adding, \u201cour hearts go out to Paul and his family, who feel the pain of separation in a way that very few people have experienced.\u201d In the meantime, Whelan remains detained in a remote prison camp in Mordovia \u2013 about eight hours away from Moscow \u2013 where he does manual labor in a clothing factory. \u201cEverything is dusty and dirty and nasty. And you do everything you can just to stay cool and just to stay clean,\u201d he described to CNN. \u201cThe food we\u2019re served is horrible. We really do rely on personal purchases to stay healthy. Medical care is nil. There is no dental care at all.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the worst environment you can imagine. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable that anyone could even consider this human rights. It\u2019s nothing that you can get used to,\u201d Whelan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/paul-whelan-2000-days-russia-custody/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_aileen-cannon-trump-classified-documents-special-counsel-constitutional-hearing", "text": "District Judge Aileen Cannon appeared skeptical of Donald Trump\u2019s arguments that Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel didn\u2019t meet constitutional requirements, but she also displayed what has been a common distrust of the prosecutors during a day-long session Friday. Trump is arguing that Smith \u2013 who has brought charges against Trump in Florida and Washington, DC\u00a0\u2013\u00a0was unlawfully appointed as special counsel. At the center of Trump\u2019s argument\u00a0is the claim that the Attorney General Merrick Garland does not have legal authority to appoint someone as special counsel who hasn\u2019t confirmed by the Senate. The Justice Department says the attorney general has ample authority to appoint \u201cinferior officers,\u201d which would include special counsels. Cannon, prepared with question after question for both the defense attorney and prosecutors, on Friday pushed Trump\u2019s lawyer to defend his claim that Smith\u2019s position amounted to a \u201cshadow government.\u201d \u201cThat sounds very ominous,\u201d Cannon said to Trump attorney Emil Bove. \u201cBut what do you really mean?\u201d Bove did not directly answer the question, but he repeated the argument that Smith was inappropriately appointed. He also said that there should be an additional hearing over the issue, which could include testimony about the relationship between Garland and Smith, arguing that the two have said Smith is acting independently and not under the direction of Garland. Cannon noted there is a regulatory system that Smith must still adhere to \u2013 to which Bove retorted that Smith still wasn\u2019t reporting to anyone. Cannon\u2019s\u00a0handling of the Trump case has been closely watched, as critics say she is taking too long to settle legal challenges from the former president, aiding his quest to delay any trial past the November election. The New York Times\u00a0reported Thursday that two federal judges in south Florida, including the district\u2019s chief judge, urged Cannon to forgo overseeing the criminal prosecution when she was first assigned the classified documents case in 2023. Pressing the special counsel\u2019s office The judge, appointed in 2020, has peppered prosecutors with questions in hearings over recent months about aspects of the case that the Justice Department treats as routine. That includes the fact that prosecutors used a grand jury in Washington to conduct the classified documents investigation before moving the case to Florida\u2019s southern district where she sits. On Friday, that wariness extended to pressing the government lawyers to specify whether Garland personally approved the Trump indictment or any other specific actions by Smith. Prosecutor James Pearce, during his arguments in the morning, said that Garland \u201ccould, this very moment\u201d fire Smith, but he added later that Garland did not review all of Smith\u2019s decisions. \u201cWe are following all the rules,\u201d Pearce argued. \u201cHas there been any actual oversight?\u201d Cannon pressed. Pearce said \u201cyes\u201d but declined to give details on internal deliberations in the Justice Department. Cannon again pushed, suggesting prosecutors were experiencing \u201cheartburn\u201d over the question of whether Garland signed off on the indictment. Pearce said that regulations require the special counsel\u2019s office to report any major developments to the attorney general. Pearce said earlier that an indictment could certainly be considered a major development. Cannon did not say when she would rule on the issue. Trump\u2019s attempt to nullify the special counsel\u2019s office\u2019s work is an anomaly among recent efforts from other defendants in different federal courts to do the same, because Cannon is giving far more time to weigh the challenge than other judges have in recent years. The judge is allowing for several hours of questioning about the authority of the special counsel\u2019s office, which is at work in federal court cases around the country, as Republican-led attacks of the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel appointments gain steam on Capitol Hill and in legal circles. The series of hearings will resume Monday with arguments over the prosecutors\u2019 request for a gag order against Trump and the former president\u2019s argument the special counsel is being unlawfully funded. Cannon allows non-parties to argue in rare move In addition to granting the hearing on the legitimacy of Smith\u2019s office, attorneys representing non-profit groups and former government officials will join the in-person debate Friday, having been allowed by Cannon to file their own arguments on the matter. It is very unusual for outside parties to be given argument time like this, especially in a criminal case at the trial level. In one filing in support of Trump\u2019s motion to toss the case, attorneys\u00a0for a former attorney general and the right-wing nonprofit Citizens United\u00a0wrote that because of his appointment outside of the Senate\u2019s review, Smith \u201cis thus one of the most powerful officials in the entire United States Government.\u201d \u201cBy pursuing a former President of the United States who is currently the leading candidate to become the next President of the United States,\u201d the group wrote, \u201cSmith\u2019s prosecution here shows that he wields the power to profoundly alter the trajectory of a presidential election, and with it the destiny of the Nation.\u201d Gene Schaerr, who represents former Attorney General Edwin Meese and Citizens United, argued that Smith\u2019s appointment gave him more power than a US attorney \u201cwithout political accountability.\u201d \u201cMr. Smith\u2019s appointment severely undermines\u201d the constitutional order, he said, arguing that special counsels must be already working in government and approved by the US Senate. Before taking the role as special counsel, Smith was a top prosecutor in the Hague, prosecuting war crimes. In support of Smith and his appointment as special counsel, attorneys representing the nonprofit State Democracy Defenders and others argued in their own filing that the constitution differentiates between \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201cinferior\u201d officers, allowing the AG to appoint the latter. Another attorney, Matthew Seligman, who argued in favor of Smith, focused on claims that Smith was fully independent from the Justice Department. \u201cThere\u2019s sufficient direction here,\u201d Seligman told the judge of the oversight from Garland, citing the regulations that govern special counsels. He added the oversight was \u201ca more hands-off approach\u201d but noted that the attorney general could fire Smith if he didn\u2019t approve of his work. In his two federal cases, attorneys for Hunter Biden also argued the indictments against him should have been dismissed because the special counsel overseeing the cases was, they argued, unlawfully appointed. Almost inverse from Trump, Biden argued that special counsel David Weiss was unlawfully appointed because he was already in the federal government and therefore not fully independent. His motions for dismissal were struck down by the two judges overseeing his cases.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_trump-vice-president-auditions-analysis", "text": "Being Donald Trump\u2019s vice president didn\u2019t end well for Mike Pence \u2014 but there\u2019s no sign his painful split from the ex-president over his anti-constitutional demands is scaring off any of the hopefuls keen to slip into his shoes. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s search for a new number two is expected to culminate with a dramatic unveiling at the Republican National Convention in a month, likely choreographed to engineer a TV ratings bump. At various points, the list of possible contenders has included Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Trump shattered all conventions about the business of running for president and serving in the Oval Office. And putting potential running mates through a televised audition process is no exception. The old school playbook in which possible nominees feign a lack of interest in the post to maximize their chances of getting it is antithetical to Trump\u2019s way of operating. Possible picks trying to catch Trump\u2019s eye go on television, knowing he\u2019s probably watching, and sprinkle compliments, talk up his chances of winning, amplify his voter fraud conspiracy theories and slam his criminal conviction. Some have made clear that they wouldn\u2019t have done what Pence did on January 6, 2021, when he concluded that he did not have power to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Congress. The almost total adoption of Trump\u2019s mantras suggests that the experience of the last Republican vice president \u2014 who was hunted with calls of \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d by members of the Trump mob that attacked the Capitol \u2014 is not giving them much pause. This despite history suggesting that, at some point in their potential mandate, a possible President Trump might ask them to so something that tests their consciences, the law or the Constitution. The attractiveness of the vice presidential nomination may reflect Trump\u2019s magnetism and the heady euphoria of being a key player in the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. For people who are wired with ambition, whether up-and-coming politicians or those who have always dreamed of the presidency but have fallen short, the vice presidency can be an attractive proposition. The job has many indignities, which include always being overshadowed by the boss, taking foreign trips he doesn\u2019t want to do, and having no real formal duties apart from being a constitutional safety net if the president dies. But the increasing belief among Republicans that the presidency is there for the taking this year \u2014 evident from their bullish public statements \u2014 means a spot on Trump\u2019s ticket is a hot ticket. And morbidly, there\u2019s a chance to be a heartbeat away from the presidency alongside a commander in chief who would be 82 by the end of his term. In many ways, Pence created a template right up until the moment in the last two weeks of his tenure that fractured his relationship with his president and ruined his post-West Wing political career. He could hardly have been more loyal to Trump, even through the ex-president\u2019s botched handling of a once-in-a-century pandemic, and at times that loyalty manifested as misty-eyed veneration. A Trump heir? Trump may not think about what will happen to his MAGA movement when he\u2019s no longer active in politics. But a second-term vice president might also be positioned to become his political heir \u2014 a proposition especially appealing to someone like Vance, a 39-year-old who has transformed himself from a harsh Trump critic to MAGA prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The first-term senator has not been afraid to advance his own credentials. In strikingly frank comments on Fox News on Monday, he said, \u201cIf Trump picks up the phone and calls you, the first sort of thought you have to have with yourself is not just, could I be vice president, but could I stand ultimately in the big chair? And look, if he asked me, I\u2019ll think about it, but I think the answer is yes,\u201d he said. The Ohio Republican said that he\u2019d not been asked about the job by Trump but made clear in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in May that he wasn\u2019t put off by what happened to Pence on January 6, 2021, after Trump publicly called on him to use his power as vice president to oversee the counting of Electoral College votes to cancel out President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger,\u201d Vance said. He has also made clear to Trump that he wouldn\u2019t have adopted Pence\u2019s interpretation of the constitutional limits on vice presidential powers. \u201cIf I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there,\u201d Vance told ABC News in February. \u201cThat is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that\u2019s what we should have done.\u201d There is no constitutional justification for such a course of action. Vance\u2019s potential rivals for a spot on Trump\u2019s ticket Vance is one of several potential vice presidential nominees, along with Rubio and Burgum, who have been sent vetting materials by the Trump campaign, CNN reported earlier this month. Burgum has taken a classic route of parlaying an unsuccessful presidential campaign into a spot in the vice presidential derby. In some ways, he\u2019s similar to Pence, who was a deeply conservative Indiana governor. The North Dakota governor has also shown the kind of unquestioning loyalty that Trump prizes. He\u2019s rich, a self-made businessman and is the kind of person with whom the ex-president has spent his life in boardrooms and golf clubs. And he\u2019s not flamboyant enough to steal the once and possibly future president\u2019s headlines. Burgum has said that he believes that Biden won the 2020 election, but has also raised concerns about its fairness, playing into Trump\u2019s false claims that changes in electoral practices to account for the Covid-19 emergency amount to fraud. And he\u2019s also endeared himself to the ex-president by downplaying his criminal conviction in New York for falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to a former adult film star as a mere trifle over accounting. Rubio has taken a lower-key approach compared to some of his rivals. But the Florida senator, who many people in Washington think still nurtures presidential ambitions after losing in humiliating fashion to Trump in the 2016 primary, appears to have been trying to make himself more palatable as a vice presidential pick. He has fervently criticized Trump\u2019s conviction in New York and in May said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he\u2019d only accept the result of the 2024 election if it was fair \u2014 despite the lack of any indication that it wouldn\u2019t be. On the same show, he signaled that despite his past ridicule of Trump on the 2016 campaign trail, and many of his original positions on issues like foreign policy and immigration that seem to clash with the ex-president, he\u2019d be ready to serve alongside him. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s offered that job to serve this country in the second highest office \u2014 assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment \u2014 if you\u2019re interested in serving the country, it\u2019s an incredible place to serve,\u201d he said. More recently, Rubio has been conjuring speculation about a possible inside track to the VP job by joining Trump for policy discussions ahead of the first presidential debate on CNN next Thursday. While most of the focus has been on Rubio, Burgum and Vance, Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach and love of keeping people off balance means that a surprise pick can\u2019t be ruled out. One potential candidate whose star seems to have dimmed is South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who rolled out a book earlier this year in an apparent bid to boost her chances but became mired in a controversy over her tale of shooting the family dog. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on June 9, Noem looked like she was trying to revive her candidacy, as she urged Trump to pick a female running mate. \u201cAll the polls tell him in these swing states that a woman on the ticket helps him win. The polls just say that,\u201d she said. Referring to a campaign trip to Wisconsin, a critical swing state, the South Dakota governor said independent voters and those leaning toward Trump \u201calso want to know that their perspective is going to be at the table when decisions are made.\u201d Less than a month before Trump is expected to make his choice, there\u2019s no real clarity on who it will be. And that\u2019s how the ex-president likes it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/trump-vice-president-auditions-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Bannon is set to report to the low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, instead of a minimum-security prison camp he had sought,\u00a0CNN reported this week. Bannon was convicted by a federal jury two years ago in Washington, DC, for not complying with\u00a0a\u00a0subpoena\u00a0for an\u00a0interview and documents in the US House\u2019s January 6, 2021, investigation. He has remained a staunch Trump ally and is a vocal supporter of his presidential reelection bid. In recent days,\u00a0Bannon has amped up his rhetoric\u00a0against the Justice Department, telling a conservative gathering in Detroit this month that they would \u201cpurge\u201d the department and \u201ctake apart\u201d the FBI if Trump won the election. The Supreme Court has asked prosecutors to respond to Bannon\u2019s emergency application by Wednesday afternoon.
