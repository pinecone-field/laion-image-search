He will be the star witness for prosecutors trying to prove Trump illegally falsified business records after paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels as part of an alleged election interference scheme in 2016. Cohen\u2019s testimony is set to be the critical moment of the hush money trial that could make Trump the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. His appearance will mark the zenith of a bitter personal feud between two brash New Yorkers obsessed with betrayal and revenge. And it marks one of the most lurid twists yet in the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s legal morass that is entwined with the 2024 election. Trump\u2019s former fixer wrote in his autobiography that he craved reflected influence and notoriety from Trump, so he adopted the real estate magnate\u2019s methods \u2014 including bullying, lying and mocking the rule of law \u2014 to serve him. He once vowed to take a bullet for his boss. But his testimony will be his latest attempt to atone for this Faustian pact after he paid the price, including with a spell in prison, for his years as a kingpin in Trump\u2019s orbit. In many ways, Cohen is the mirror image of Trump \u2014 a colorful braggart and social media provocateur who craved power and riches and was prepared to pay any price and to intimidate anyone to get them. Cohen, who worked for the Trump Organization cleaning up the mess from the family\u2019s personal scandals and busted business deals, facilitated the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, he says, on the orders of his boss. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, whose testimony last week about their alleged liaison at Lake Tahoe in 2006 seemed excruciating for the ex-president. He has pleaded not guilty in this case and to three other criminal indictments. Cohen\u2019s value as a witness is that he was involved in every aspect of Trump\u2019s business and personal life, knew all his secrets, and was allegedly an accessory in his efforts to break the law and thwart accountability. In his book \u201cDisloyal,\u201d Cohen wrote, \u201cI know where the skeletons are buried because I was the one who buried them.\u201d Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement that \u201cCohen made that payment at the defendant\u2019s direction, and he did it to influence the presidential election.\u201d After the election, Trump is accused of working out a scheme in the Oval Office to reimburse Cohen for the hush money payment in installments disguised as billing for legal services. \u201cThe defendant falsified those business records because he wanted to conceal his and others\u2019 criminal conduct,\u201d Colangelo said, adding that both Cohen and the prosecution will be up-front about mistakes Cohen has made in the past. Cohen\u2019s friend and fellow former Trump acolyte Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as the ex-president\u2019s White House communications director, said the former fixer will be able to prove the criminality of campaign interference. \u201cI think unfortunately for Donald Trump, Michael Cohen has the receipts for everything that went on,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper  on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re smoking gun receipts, and he\u2019s going to provide very compelling, very honest, very direct testimony.\u201d How Trump\u2019s legal team will seek to discredit Cohen But like Trump, Cohen has a long history of trashing the truth, and since turning on his onetime mentor, he has sought to monetize his campaign against him with books \u2013 including one called \u201cRevenge\u201d \u2013 podcasts and television appearances. He is, therefore, vulnerable to a savage cross-examination by Trump\u2019s attorneys, who will lambast him as an unreliable witness on a quest for payback as they seek to sow reasonable doubt over Trump\u2019s culpability in the mind of at least one juror. Trump\u2019s attorneys will argue that his payments to Cohen were a legal retainer and that paying someone to stop what they say are unfounded rumors about the ex-president is not illegal. In his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche suggested Cohen sought revenge because he was not given a job in the new president\u2019s administration in 2017. He also accused Cohen of an unhealthy obsession with Trump. \u201cHe criticizes President Trump. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump go to prison. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump\u2019s family go to prison. He has talked extensively about President Trump getting convicted in this case,\u201d Blanche said. Trump\u2019s former fixer was sent to prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump business project in Russia, for orchestrating illegal campaign contributions in the form of hush money payments and on various tax evasion charges. How prosecutors built a foundation under Cohen\u2019s testimony This issue of credibility is why prosecutors have spent days building a foundation for Cohen\u2019s testimony, taking jurors through inner workings of the Trump Organization including with bank records, text messages and evidence from the firm\u2019s former employees as they seek to prove 34 counts that allege Trump falsified financial records to hide the hush money payments. The testimony from Daniels was designed to illustrate the incident Trump allegedly tried to keep from voters in his successful White House campaign eight years ago. Former Nixon White House counsel John Dean said on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d on Saturday that the government case against Trump was \u201cvery powerful\u201d and that \u201cthey have built such a structure that Michael Cohen can come in and testify and he is largely corroborated already.\u201d Cohen has tried to counter defense claims that he has ulterior motives for seeking vengeance against Trump by styling his decision to flip on the former president as a quest for redemption and an attempt to warn the public about the danger Trump poses if he is elected in November. At a dramatic congressional hearing in 2019, Cohen painted a stunning portrait of the mob-like world in which his former boss did business and said that \u201cmy loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything.\u201d He testified that everything he did \u2014 from organizing the suppression of tabloid news stories unflattering to Trump, to bullying business rivals and closing deals \u2014 was in the service of one thing: \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump,\u201d he said, adding that he had been directed by his boss to threaten people more than 500 times. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,\u201d Cohen said. The Trump worshipper-turned-enemy was a small-time lawyer and businessman who made his fortune in New York taxi medallions before he came to the future president\u2019s attention when he was looking for an enforcer along the lines of the late and notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn. Trump, who will sit just feet away from his former henchman in the courtroom this week, has been equally unflattering about Cohen. He\u2019s spent months lacerating his former lawyer\u2019s character on social media. And Cohen\u2019s appearance on the witness stand will likely prove one of the biggest tests of Trump\u2019s capacity to avoid infringing the gag order protecting key witnesses and court staff that he has already been fined $10,000 for violating 10 times. Last week, Judge Juan Merchan directly warned Trump that future violations could force him to impose jail time. It will not be the first time the two former partners meet in court. Cohen was a key witness in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial in New York last fall that resulted in a near half-billion-dollar judgment against the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. In what Cohen described as a \u201check of a reunion,\u201d he testified that he manipulated Trump\u2019s financial statements to \u201creverse-engineer\u201d them to hit an arbitrary net wealth figure in a key moment in the prosecution case. He also sparred heatedly with Trump\u2019s lawyers, who tried to discredit him in cross-examination in a way that underscores the risk prosecutors will take putting him on the stand in the hush money trial \u2014 which, unlike the civil fraud case, is being heard by a jury. It is becoming clearer that this trial \u2014 seen by legal experts as the weakest criminal threat facing the former president \u2014 may be the only one to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The three other cases are all effectively on hold. The Supreme Court is deliberating the former president\u2019s sweeping immunity claims arising from his federal election interference indictment, and a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has postponed his classified documents trial after dragging her feet on adjudicating pretrial motions and disputes. The election interference case in Florida has become mired in a controversy over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case. While the hush money trial harks back to the 2016 election, its end game could play a significant role in the destiny of the White House eight years later. There is no clear sign yet that proceedings have had any impact on Trump\u2019s standing in the race after he brandished his indictments to bolster his claims that he\u2019s the victim of election interference himself. This helped him crush the GOP primary field, and some polls suggest that some Republicans could think twice about voting for him in a neck-and-neck race with President Joe Biden if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the ex-president would be sure to use any acquittal to argue that all of the cases against him are equally meritless. Cohen\u2019s testimony, therefore, may have consequences far beyond the courtroom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Both candidates have accepted an invitation from CNN to debate on June 27 in the network\u2019s Atlanta studios. Some aspects \u2013 including the lack of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates. CNN has set several parameters for candidates to qualify. All participating debaters must meet the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets. Participants must file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so. Candidates must also appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Biden and Trump will meet those requirements, but they make the others less likely to be able to participate - though, in Kennedy\u2019s case, it\u2019s not an impossibility. Kennedy is on the ballot in only five states, though the campaign says it has gathered enough signatures to make it on the ballots of several more. West\u2019s campaign says he has secured ballot access for six states. Kennedy has been averaging about 13% in recent national polling. West and Stein have been averaging at about 3%. Debaters must also agree to accept the rules and format of the debate. Trump and Biden have agreed to do so. Both Trump and Biden have also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/qualifications-for-june-27-cnn-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_menendez-gold-cash-what-matters", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey faces his second, distinct bribery and corruption trial in seven years starting Monday. This new case is a complicated affair involving multiple gold bars, envelopes of cash, a Mercedes and a lot more that, prosecutors say, the powerful former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his new wife (they got married during the alleged bribery scheme) obtained in exchange for helping a halal meat monopoly, granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution. Menendez, who has until June to announce if he\u2019s running for reelection, has pleaded not guilty and denied all of the charges. He told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence.\u201d Also pleading not guilty and denying wrongdoing are his wife Nadine, who is also a named as a defendant, and two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who have ties to Egypt and Qatar, respectively. Another man, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe, on the other hand, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Here\u2019s what prosecutors say the senator and his wife got: Gold bars Prosecutors say Hana and Daibes gave Menendez and his wife gold bars, which were seized by the FBI from the Menendez residence. After returning from a trip to Egypt and getting a ride home from the airport from Daibes\u2019 driver, prosecutors say Menendez searched online for the price of a gold bar. Envelopes full of cash The indictment includes photos of piles of cash next to envelopes spread across jackets on which the senator\u2019s name is embroidered. There are piles of $20 bills and $50 bills in one photo and $100 bills in another photo. They also found cash in closets, a safe and Nadine Menendez\u2019s safety deposit box. Some of the envelopes, according to prosecutors, bore fingerprints or DNA belonging to Daibes or his driver. Total cash discovered: More than $480,000 in the home and more than $70,000 in the safety deposit box. Later court filings that added charges in the case are more specific, describing bags full of cash being found on top of hangers in the senator\u2019s basement and stuffed into boots in the closet. Convertible Mercedes The 2019 vehicle, which prosecutors value at more than $60,000, was parked in the driveway at the Menendez home when it was raided. The indictment describes Nadine Menendez obtaining $15,000 in cash from Uribe in a parking lot the day before she picked the vehicle up and put $15,000 as a down payment. Uribe is alleged to have then hid his monthly financing payments for the vehicle. Later, after the raid, she would write Uribe a $21,000 check, which prosecutors say was an effort at cleanup, making the gift look like a loan. Nadine Menendez needed a new car, apparently after hitting and killing a jaywalker in Bogota, New Jersey, in December 2018. A police report was filed but she faced no charges. Mortgage payment Prosecutors say the senator and his wife also tried to cover up around $23,000 in help Nadine Menendez got from a halal meat company owned by Hana that bailed her out of foreclosure on a mortgage. Reimbursement checks were paid in December 2022, months after the initial raid on the senator\u2019s house. Payment for low- or no-show work Hana\u2019s company paid Nadine Menendez $10,000 on three occasions, according to prosecutors. At the time, they allege, she was acting as a sort of go-between for Egyptian officials, Hana and the senator. Engagement ring Prosecutors describe a recorded conversation between Hana and a confidential source in which Hana is described as obtaining $150,000 from a man to purchase a car and an engagement ring for Nadine Menendez in exchange for the senator giving a \u201cpush\u201d in a New Jersey criminal case that saved the man three years. Basement carpeting Prosecutors said in their February court filing that Nadine Menendez arranged for carpeting to be installed in her basement, apparently in exchange for setting up dinners between the senator and officials \u2013 and also for his call, according to prosecutors, attempting to interfere in a New Jersey state prosecution. Furniture The initial September 2023 indictment makes several mentions of furniture and furnishings provided by Hana and Daibes but does not go into specifics. Formula One tickets In a superseding indictment filed in March, prosecutors allege Menendez obtained tickets to Formula One races in 2022 and 2023 for Nadine Menendez\u2019s relative. Menendez made comments supportive of Qatar during that period and lobbied Qatari officials to invest in Daibes\u2019 real estate venture, which they ultimately did. Daibes is described as sending the senator pictures of luxury watches priced between roughly $10,000 and $24,000, but it is not clear from the filing if Menendez ever obtained a timepiece. What\u2019s the quid pro quo? There is a long list of actions prosecutors say Menendez undertook in exchange for all of these alleged bribes. They allege Menendez, in his prior role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \u2026 lobbied the US Department of Agriculture to maintain Hana\u2019s monopoly on US halal meat exports to Egypt, even though it drove up prices. \u2026 met with Egyptian officials in exchange for cash. \u2026 gave Hana not-classified but also not-public information about employees at the US embassy in Egypt. \u2026 passed on information about US military sales to Egypt to Hana and signed off on certain sales. \u2026 lobbied Qataris on behalf of Daibes\u2019 real estate scheme and supported resolutions in the Senate supportive of Qatar. \u2026 tried to influence court cases in New Jersey related to Uribe and his associates. Uribe, recall, is now cooperating with prosecutors. \u2026 tried to disrupt a federal prosecution of Daibes.  Again, Menendez denies all the charges, and the jury that will get to hear his side of the story will begin to be selected in New York starting Monday. Nadine Menendez\u2019s trial is slated for July. Perhaps Menendez and his wife can convincingly argue the mortgage and car payments were a loan. Perhaps Menendez will argue he did not know about payments related to dinners and meetings organized by his wife. The envelopes of cash prosecutors say bore Daibes\u2019 fingerprints may be more difficult to explain. Menendez escaped previous bribery charge Menendez is used to being under the microscope of federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice ultimately decided not to retry Menendez in 2018 after a previous jury deadlocked over whether he accepted trips and gifts from a friend, an ophthalmologist named Salomon Melgen. Melgen went to prison in a separate Medicare fraud scheme, but that sentence was commuted by then-President Donald Trump after lobbying by Menendez on Melgen\u2019s behalf.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/menendez-gold-cash-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_presidents-campaigning-what-matters", "text": "When he talks to reporters outside the New York courtroom where he is on trial for falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump usually complains he\u2019d rather be with voters. \u201cThey want to keep me off the campaign trail,\u201d he said on Tuesday, suggesting the trial is part of an election interference conspiracy, for which there is no evidence. It was a similar story last week, when Trump said he should be campaigning in battleground states. \u201cWe\u2019re at a courthouse instead of being in any one of I would say 10 states where I\u2019d like to be right now,\u201d he said to TV cameras that beamed his remarks around the country. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has been folding trips to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida into his schedule. Trump chose not to campaign when court was out of session Wednesday, but he will appear in New Jersey this weekend. Both major candidates obviously perceive value in the act of campaigning \u2014 being on the trail and speaking directly to voters. It\u2019s hard to believe that early American presidents did no personal campaigning whatsoever. They thought it was beneath them and the office they held. I talked to Brendan\u00a0Doherty, a\u00a0professor of political science at the United States Naval Academy and author of the books,\u00a0\u201cThe Rise of the President\u2019s Permanent Campaign\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cFundraiser in Chief: Presidents and the Politics of Campaign Cash,\u201d about why early presidents stayed off the trail and how this became the permanent campaign. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below: WOLF: Why didn\u2019t early presidents personally campaign? DOHERTY: In the early decades of the republic, presidential candidates adhered to the norm that they should not actively campaign for office. It was seen as unseemly to seek the office to which they hoped to be elected. But that didn\u2019t stop them from finding other ways of communicating with voters. WOLF: How did these early non-campaigning presidents get their message out? DOHERTY: While early presidential candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, their supporters got the word out on their behalf. Newspapers were openly\u00a0partisan in the early republic, and many of their articles openly praised or criticized various candidates. While candidates did not attend political conventions in the 1800s, supporters made the case for their preferred candidates in ways that drove news coverage. In the late 1800s, some presidential candidates mounted what were called \u201cfront porch campaigns.\u201d They would speak to supporters at or near their homes, and newspapers would cover these speeches and spread their messages across the country. WOLF: What are some key moments in the rise of the current model of campaigning? DOHERTY: In 1866, President Andrew Johnson broke from precedent and actively campaigned in the midterm elections. His travel to give a series of speeches was called the Swing around the Circle, and he was criticized both for actively campaigning and for using inflammatory rhetoric while doing so. Two years later, the House of Representatives impeached Johnson for, among other things, giving these campaign speeches that brought Congress into \u201cdisgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach.\u201d In 1896, Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan actively campaigned across the country, while the eventual winner, Republican William McKinley, conducted a front porch campaign. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt became the first presidential candidate to appear at a convention to accept his nomination in person. And in 1948, Harry Truman actively campaigned across the country, giving speeches from the back of a train in what became known as his whistle-stop campaign. WOLF: Who was, in your view, the best natural campaigner who ran for president? What did they do differently? DOHERTY: While it\u2019s hard to pick out a single best campaigner, two who come to mind are John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Kennedy actively campaigned in the primary elections in 1960 at a time when leading candidates often skipped active campaigning during the nomination contest. But he wanted to demonstrate his electability to party leaders who might be skeptical that a Catholic could win the White House after the only other Catholic major party nominee had lost in a landslide to Herbert Hoover in 1928. Kennedy was widely seen as charming and eloquent on the stump, and his wins in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries helped him win his party\u2019s nomination and then the White House. Reagan channeled his years of performance as an actor and his sense of humor to campaign effectively for the presidency. His voice, his timing, and his telling of stories and jokes to connect with his audiences won him much praise. When questioners implied that being an actor wasn\u2019t adequate preparation to be president, Reagan would respond that he didn\u2019t know how someone could be an effective president who hadn\u2019t been an actor. WOLF: Is active campaigning \u2014 holding rallies and flying from stop to stop \u2014 effective in a country of more than 335 million people? A candidate can only shake so many hands. Plus, most people already lean toward one party or the other. What does putting a candidate on the trail accomplish? DOHERTY: While presidential candidates can only meet a relatively small sliver of the American population \u2014 and, more importantly, of the population of the small number of Electoral College\u00a0battleground states\u00a0that will decide a presidential election \u2014 their campaigning can drive news coverage, which has a multiplier effect when it comes to getting their message out. Political science studies have shown that local news coverage is often more favorable to presidents and presidential candidates than national news coverage is, so candidates campaign in part so that local media outlets will amplify their campaign messages. While it\u2019s increasingly difficult for candidates to grab and hold the public\u2019s attention given our increasingly fragmented media landscape, that certainly doesn\u2019t stop presidential hopefuls from trying. WOLF: I suppose the inverse of candidates who don\u2019t campaign is our current system, in which they only briefly stop campaigning to govern. Why is the permanent campaign a problem, and how could it be fixed? DOHERTY: Modern presidents campaign for themselves and for their fellow party members throughout their term in office. They raise campaign funds and they travel to key electoral states. While presidents used to try not to appear to be overly focused on campaigning too early in their term in office, that\u2019s no longer the case. In the summer of his third year in office, Ronald Reagan refused to tell an interviewer whether or not he would run for another term because he said that he didn\u2019t want everything he did as president to be seen through a political lens. In contrast, Donald Trump filed paperwork establishing his reelection campaign committee on the day in 2017 when he was inaugurated as president, and he held his first reelection fundraiser less than six months later, in June of his first year in office. When presidents begin their explicit campaigning earlier and earlier in their term in office, they are responding to the incentives of our electoral system. But time is the president\u2019s scarcest resource, and time spent campaigning is time not spent doing the important job to which he, and someday she, was elected. For better or worse, there are no readily apparent realistic fixes that could stop a reelection-focused president from campaigning for reelection throughout his term in office. WOLF: If transportation and technology have helped candidates directly reach more and more people, where do you see campaign methods heading next? DOHERTY: Technological advances have helped candidates connect with the American people, from the radio to television, the internet, and now social media. These developments, along with advances in campaigns\u2019 ability to micro-target voters in key states with messages designed to appeal to issues they care about, have led campaigns to shift away from broadcasting appeals in favor of narrow, targeted outreach to potentially persuadable voters. In an era in which so much of what voters do online is tracked and can be used to build profiles of voters\u2019 interests and preferences, I expect that this micro-targeting will become ever more precise, allowing campaigns to tailor increasingly specific messages to the voters they are trying to reach.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/presidents-campaigning-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_trump-allies-courthouse-appearances", "text": "Several of Donald Trump\u2019s allies are flocking to the Manhattan criminal courthouse where Trump is on trial to display their support for the former president as explosive testimony unfolds about his alleged sexual encounter with an adult film actress and the hush money payment made to keep it under wraps before the 2016 election. The courtroom has become a backdrop for potential vice-presidential auditions, as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who are both under consideration for the job, made the trip this week to stand alongside Trump and offer their full-throated support of him. It has also become a way for Republican leaders to curry favor more broadly with Trump.  On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has increasingly aligned himself with the former president amid blowback he\u2019s received from the far right, became the highest ranking Republican to make the trip. The politicians coming to Trump\u2019s defense are attacking the people Trump is barred from publicly speaking about under his gag order, including the prosecution\u2019s star witness Michael Cohen, whose testimony began Monday. Their presence at the courthouse also allows them to show their loyalty \u2014 a trait highly valued and rewarded by the former president \u2014 and gives them a high-profile platform to angle for a potential administration position should Trump win another term. Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills, as well as former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, joined Trump in court on Tuesday. They, along with Burgum, all wore Trump\u2019s trademark red tie and white shirt and held a joint press conference outside of the courthouse. The four men took turns unleashing attacks on Cohen, whose testimony continued on Tuesday, as well as Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s daughter, who has ties to Democrats. They also sought to undermine the credibility of the charges brought against Trump. \u201cThe sooner that this scam trial can be concluded, the sooner that the president can get back to getting out campaigning and talking to the American people about the issues that matter to them,\u201d Burgum told reporters as he bashed Cohen as a \u201cserial perjurer.\u201d Burgum later told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins that he was there\u00a0\u201ccompletely as a volunteer,\u201d and \u201cbecause I care about the future of this country and where it\u2019s going.\u201d Ramaswamy said, \u201cI learned a lot from being in there in person. It is one of the most depressing places I have been in my life, but it is fitting because the only thing more depressing than the environment of that courtroom is what\u2019s actually happening in there.\u201d Johnson told reporters, \u201cI called President Trump and told him I wanted to be here myself to call out what is a travesty of justice, and I think everybody around the country can see that. President Trump is a friend and I wanted to be here to support him.\u201d Their court visits came after Vance, another potential vice presidential pick, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville appeared with Trump in the courtroom on Monday. Both Vance and Tuberville spoke to reporters outside of the courthouse and attacked Cohen, trying to undermine his\u00a0credibility during his first day of testimony. \u201cDoes any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?\u201d Vance told reporters outside of the criminal courthouse moments before Tuberville panned Cohen\u2019s testimony as \u201can acting scene\u201d and said he was a \u201cserial liar.\u201d New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird also appeared in court with Trump on Monday. Florida Sen. Rick Scott joined Trump in court last week, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton made the trip the week before. Eric Trump has appeared with his father at the trial, and several of the former president\u2019s top advisers regularly accompany him to court. In the weeks ahead, more of Trump\u2019s allies are expected to join Trump in court, according to a Trump campaign official. The official said \u201ca number of\u201d his friends and supporters have reached out to him and the campaign to ask if they could come to the courthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s going to continue, and it\u2019s just a demonstration of how offended so many of our friends are by what\u2019s happening to the president,\u201d the official told CNN. One person familiar with the campaign argued there were no political downsides for the politicians making the trip to the courthouse to rail against the case against Trump, and that it would give them coveted airtime amid the highly publicized trial. \u201cIf there was a safe trial to show up to, this is the one,\u201d this person said. Trump is a defendant in three other criminal cases and faces charges over his alleged mishandling of classified material and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all 88 charges against him. Mark Serrano, who was a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, said in an interview with CNN he thought the gag order Trump is under was one of the main reasons Trump\u2019s allies felt compelled to show up at the trial. \u201cJudge Merchan has taken Donald Trump\u2019s voice away to a degree. He has stripped him of his first amendment rights and people like J.D. Vance and Tommy Tuberville and others are going to come to New York and they\u2019re going to lend their voice to Donald Trump,\u201d Serrano said. Trump has been fined a total of $10,000 for violating the gag order that bars him from publicly discussing witnesses. The violations included comments he made about Cohen, who is a key witness for the prosecution as they make the case Trump illegally falsified business records after paying off adult film actress\u00a0Stormy Daniels as part of an alleged election interference scheme in 2016. Trump has pleaded not guilty to the 34 felony criminal charges\u00a0of falsifying business records in the New York case. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_arizona-officials-giuliani-indictment-2020", "text": "Arizona prosecutors have tried for weeks \u2013 and so far failed \u2013 to serve Rudy Giuliani with notice of his indictment related to an alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. Giuliani is among a group of former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies indicted last month in Arizona alongside the 11 individuals who acted as fake GOP electors from the state in the last presidential election. But the former New York City mayor and one-time attorney for Trump is the only defendant prosecutors have been unable to serve with a summons, according to Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office. The summons is a formal notice that Giuliani has been criminally charged and must appear before a judge on May 21, and a team of prosecutors and investigators working for Arizona Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes has made multiple attempts to locate him, Taylor told CNN. CNN has reached out to a spokesman for Giuliani for comment. Giuliani, multiple associates have told CNN, is in Palm Beach, Florida, at his residence. According to two sources familiar with Giuliani\u2019s movements, the former mayor has been traveling back and forth between Palm Beach and New York City where he has been alternating between working on a planned appeal of the $148 million defamation judgment against him, which a district judge denied Tuesday, and the sale of his $5.7 million New York City apartment, where prosecutors have tried for weeks to serve him. According to Taylor, two agents for the attorney general\u2019s office traveled to New York City with plans to hand-deliver the notice to Giuliani the day after the state-level grand jury handed up its indictment. The agents believed Giuliani was likely in his New York City apartment because he had recently video streamed from there \u2013 which they determined by matching the setting of the feed with pictures of the interior of the residence from an old real estate listing. But upon arriving at the building, a person at the front desk told the agents they were not allowed to accept service of the documents, according to Taylor, who added that the individual did not dispute Giuliani lived there. \u201cWe were not granted access,\u201d Taylor added, confirming details previously reported by the Washington Post. While Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \u201cUnindicted Coconspirator 1.\u201d \u201cIn Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\u201d the indictment reads. \u201cUnwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona\u2019s voters.\u201d Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, his close adviser Boris Epshteyn, the Republican National Committee\u2019s top lawyer for \u201celection integrity\u201d Christina Bobb and former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman are among those charged in Arizona alongside Giuliani.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_bob-menendez-bribery-trial", "text": "Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s lawyer launched his defense Wednesday in a Manhattan courtroom, insisting that the New Jersey Democrat never engaged in the international bribery scheme described by federal prosecutors and asserting that there were \u201cinnocent explanations\u201d for the tangle of alleged crimes that has already upended Menendez\u2019s political career. \u201cThey want you to be blinded by the gold and the cash,\u201d Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman told the jury, suggesting that many of the items the senator allegedly took as bribes \u2013 including gold bars and a luxury car \u2013 were owned or obtained by his wife, Nadine, who is also charged and set to go on trial in July. Menendez\u00a0has been charged\u00a0with acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and assisting the government of Qatar, all while taking bribes from several New Jersey businessmen.\u00a0He is being tried with two of his co-defendants: Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. All three have pleaded not guilty.\u00a0Menendez is not running for reelection in next month\u2019s Democratic primary but has said he would consider an independent bid should he be exonerated. In a federal courthouse, blocks from the site of former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz told jurors in her opening statement that they would see evidence and hear testimony of a yearslong conspiracy between Menendez, his wife and two New Jersey businessmen to take bribes while using his power to influence military aid to Egypt and pressure prosecutors and investigators to stop investigations and criminal cases. \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket. That is why we are here today. That is what this trial is all about.\u201d While Nadine Menendez, who has also pleaded not guilty, is not yet on trial, her\u00a0alleged\u00a0actions and influence on her husband were\u00a0a key part\u00a0of the defense\u2019s opening statement. Weitzman repeatedly argued that the couple have mostly led \u201cseparate lives\u201d and \u201chad separate finances.\u201d \u201cThey even had a separate cell phone plan,\u201d he added, before spelling out a series of \u201cfinancial concerns that (Nadine) kept from Bob,\u201d whom Weitzman described as being smitten by a \u201cbeautiful and tall, international woman.\u201d Weitzman also argued that Menendez \u201cwas acting lawfully\u201d in his role as a US senator, portraying interactions prosecutors have called corrupt as mere diplomatic efforts for the US and advocacy on behalf of his New Jersey constituents \u2013 including some longtime friends. \u201cYou might not like it,\u201d Weitzman said, \u201cbut it is not a crime.\u201d In explaining the gold bars found in Menendez\u2019s house by investigators, Weitzman again pointed the finger at the senator\u2019s wife, who, he said, kept the \u201cfamily gold.\u201d Nadine, Weitzman said, is from Lebanon, where keeping gold is \u201ccultural,\u201d in part because of the region\u2019s historically unstable currencies, while adding that gifts of gold and silver are common for weddings and engagements. \u201cEvidence will show Nadine\u2019s family had a lot of gold,\u201d Weitzman said, asserting that she did not discuss money with the senator and kept financial problems she had from him. Weitzman also said the gold bars were found in Nadine\u2019s locked closet, which the senator didn\u2019t have access to. To emphasize the point, the defense showed the court an image of a walk-in closet, which appeared messy. Among the \u201cinnocent explanations,\u201d Weitzman suggested there was nothing abnormal about co-defendant Daibes\u2019 fingerprints on envelopes containing tens of thousands of dollars in cash found in the senator\u2019s home, stating that the two had been friends for decades. \u201cWould you be surprised,\u201d Weitzman asked, \u201cto find your friend\u2019s fingerprints on one of your belongings?\u201d Opening statements for Daibes and Hana will begin Thursday morning. Jury selection Pomerantz\u2019s and Weitzman\u2019s opening statements began Wednesday following the swearing-in of 12 jurors and six alternates. During\u00a0the nearly-three-day juror selection process, the pool of potential jurors was read a list of more than 100 possible witnesses in the case, from sitting and former US senators to several sheikhs and former White House officials, as well as a list of companies and entities, including Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The vast majority of those named on the witness list \u2013 which is used to help attorneys and the court whittle down the jury pool \u2013 will not be called to testify. The potential jurors \u2013 an array of New Yorkers, including pastors, a standup comedian and amateur musicians \u2013 were pressed on whether they could be unbiased and fairly consider testimony from law enforcement officers or convicted criminals. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you ladies and gentlemen how important it is that this case proceed with a fair impartial jury,\u201d federal judge Sidney Stein told the potential jurors on Tuesday, saying that means \u201cpeople who come without any bias\u201d ready to put aside \u201canything about this case\u201d they\u2019ve heard from the media. \u201cThis system will only work if people are fair and honest and impartial,\u201d Stein said. The initial group of 150 potential jurors was pared down to less than 100 after the initial phase of the selection process, during which people cited travel plans, including an overseas bar mitzvah and a Paris research grant, as well as work and health issues, when asked if any hardships would prevent them from sitting on a trial that could last over a month. One potential juror spoke about being a \u201cnews junkie\u201d who couldn\u2019t sit on the trial because \u201cI\u2019ve learned about the case significantly. I knew it was Bob Menendez the second I walked in.\u201d Stein asked if the potential juror could set aside prior knowledge and solely rely on evidence and testimony to decide this case, to which the person replied: \u201cI mean, I think so, but again, you know, this is something I\u2019ve read about.\u201d When one potential juror cited his new job at a fashion consulting agency and fears that he could be let go if he had to sit on the jury, Stein told him that the trial could be \u201cvery interesting.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to lose your job,\u201d the judge said, \u201cbut by the same token, I think you\u2019ll find this \u2013 I think all jurors would find this case \u2026 to be very interesting and informative.\u201d During the more direct phase of questioning potential jurors on what they did for a living and where they got their news, the judge was more lighthearted, bantering with them at times. After one potential juror said he worked in neuroscience, Stein told him that during a break \u201cyou\u2019ll have to tell me \u2026 how a worm gets in somebody\u2019s brain,\u201d referring to independent presidential candidate\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s revelation\u00a0about a parasitic worm previously entering his brain. \u201cAnd again, I\u2019m not doing that to be facetious; I just want to avoid it,\u201d the judge said.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden", "text": "Joe Biden sounded more like a professional wrestler than a president when he issued a vertical video social media debate challenge to his rival Wednesday morning. \u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020!\u201d Biden said at the outset of the 14-second video, during which he also found time to: \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Trump said, accepting the challenge on his social media platform with a nod to words that typically open boxing matches. The debates are set for June 27 on CNN and September 10 on ABC News. While Biden proposed two meetings and a vice presidential in late July, Trump\u2019s campaign suggested debates in July and August \u2013 the months when the Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are taking place \u2013 as well. \u201dI think we should go two hours,\u201d Trump said during an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, an attempt to criticize Biden\u2019s endurance. Trump added that the debaters should be required to stand at a podium rather than sit. \u201cI think a debate should be standing up,\u201d he said. Both men, well into their Social Security and Medicare years, would like to appear as forceful as possible. CNN invited the presumptive nominees to debate on the network on June 27 at CNN\u2019s studio in Atlanta. It\u2019ll be on cable, so not exactly pay-per-view, but certainly not the aired-everywhere style that has become typical of presidential debate since the Commission on Presidential Debates started sponsoring them in 1988. Those commission-sponsored debates were broadcast on every network with the same sets reused every four years and conducted usually at colleges and universities with live audiences. A town hall version allowed select voters to ask questions of both candidates. The commission said its debates are planned and it will carry forward with planning. The CNN debate, on the other hand, will be conducted in a TV studio with no audience, which means no applause or cheering. While the specific format for the ABC News debate has not been announced, a debate at ABC News studios in New York would harken back to the first televised presidential debates in 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated four times. While he has accepted both invitations, Trump was already criticizing the idea of an in-studio debate. In a social media post that included an insult for Biden, Trump said he preferred, \u201cfor excitement purposes, a very large venue, although\u00a0Biden\u00a0is supposedly afraid of crowds.\u201d Still, Biden\u2019s challenge and Trump\u2019s response were not entirely spontaneous. From CNN\u2019s report: Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates have taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.\u00a0The Washington Post was first\u00a0to report on those conversations. June is already shaping up to be an exceptionally busy month in US politics. The Supreme Court could rule then on whether Trump should enjoy any sort of absolute immunity from prosecution. Biden\u2019s son Hunter faces two separate criminal trials, one for tax evasion in Los Angeles and the other for a rarely prosecuted gun charge in Delaware. CNN\u2019s debate that month will come before either party conducts its nominating convention, presumably before Trump picks a running mate, and much earlier than the commission\u2019s planned debates, the first of which had been scheduled for September. After grumbling from both campaigns, the Commission on Presidential Debates issued a statement arguing that beginning in September would still allow for early voters to watch before making a decision. The campaigns clearly disagreed; Trump and Biden have both argued that earlier debates are warranted since many Americans are likely to vote early in the months before Election Day on November 5. Biden, for his part, may be looking for a quicker opportunity to reset the narrative of the campaign, in which his arguments about the strength of the economy or the threat Trump poses to democracy have not yet helped him gain traction in battleground states. Trump, meanwhile, could benefit from turning the conversation away from his criminal trials and work to harden perceptions of Biden as soon as possible. One person who has already indicated he is not thrilled with the debate plans: independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In order to qualify for CNN\u2019s debate, a candidate must be polling at or above 15% in four national polls of registered or likely voters between March 13 and June 20 and be on the ballot in enough states to conceivably win 270 electoral votes, according to a news release from CNN. ABC News outlined similar criteria. For now, that would exclude Kennedy. In a post on X, he accused the campaigns of \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the stage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_cohen-trump-prison-what-matters", "text": "After watching his former fixer Michael Cohen testify against him on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump is expected to attend a fundraiser in New York City co-hosted by Charles Kushner, his son-in-law\u2019s father, whom he pardoned in 2020. The crimes for which Kushner went to prison \u2013 tax evasion and campaign finance violations \u2013 had nothing to do with Trump, but they were tawdry enough to compete with a porn star hush money trial. Trying to intimidate his sister from testifying before a grand jury, the elder Kushner set up a sort of rogue sting operation in which he meant to videotape his sister\u2019s brother with a prostitute and then send the tape to his sister. At least those are the broad outlines of the tale as told by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was then the US attorney for the state who prosecuted the case. Christie was ultimately denied a Trump Cabinet position after Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, opposed the idea. Now Christie, like Cohen, is a former Trump associate trying to take the former president down. RELATED: Read about Cohen\u2019s testimony in Trump\u2019s trial. Cohen is rare in the universe of Trump associates since he both turned on Trump and went to prison. Many of the other Trump aides and associates who faced jail eventually got pardons or clemency and still support the former president. Manafort still wants to help Paul Manafort is still in Trump\u2019s camp despite spending years in jail during a legal odyssey. Manafort ran Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for a time, but then later, while Trump was president, Manafort \u2013 who made money as a foreign lobbyist \u2013 was convicted for federal tax evasion, among other things. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the US. Trump continually expressed sympathy for Manafort. Manafort served two years until he was released to home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic and was ultimately pardoned before Trump left office. He\u2019s back in the foreign lobbying business, although the optics of being involved in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign were apparently too much. Manafort recently backed away from a supporting role helping plan the Republican National Convention after media scrutiny over his involvement. Bannon faces jail for post-pardon activity Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House chief strategist turned right-wing provocateur, obtained a Trump pardon before he could be tried for allegedly defrauding donors of contributions intended to help build a wall on the US border with Mexico. Pardoning Bannon was one of Trump\u2019s final acts in office. Bannon associates in the scheme who did not receive pardons have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Trump\u2019s pardon helped Bannon avoid prosecution in the border wall scheme, but Bannon may yet go to prison. He was the subject of a rare prosecution by the Department of Justice for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Bannon ignored summons to testify before the now-disbanded House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. A federal appeals court recently rejected his attempt to further delay his four-month sentence, and prosecutors this week asked for Bannon\u2019s sentence to be imposed. Bannon hosts a widely downloaded podcast that is supportive of Trump. Another former top Trump aide, Peter Navarro, has already reported to prison after his conviction for contempt of Congress. Trump can\u2019t help Bannon or Navarro now, since he\u2019s not currently president, but he has already promised to use pardon power to help people convicted of crimes related to January 6, a riot committed by his supporters. Stone, Flynn avoided jail Trump already has a notable history of helping supporters when he is able. He commuted the sentence of his longtime friend Roger Stone, the political operative who was convicted by a jury of, among other things, obstructing the Russia investigation. Trump also issued a wide-ranging pardon to retired Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who was charged with lying to investigators. Flynn had entered a guilty plea and then tried to rescind it, and the yearslong legal saga hung over Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump issued the Flynn pardon shortly after losing the 2020 presidential election. Flynn is now an avowed QAnon conspiracy theorist, but Trump has said he could bring him back in a second Trump administration. Trump\u2019s longtime CFO is back on Rikers Trump also can\u2019t help another lieutenant, Allen Weisselberg, who stayed loyal. Weisselberg already served one monthslong jail sentence on Rikers Island for a yearslong tax scheme. But then he was found to have lied during a deposition in the civil fraud trial in which Trump was found to have inflated his wealth to get favorable loans. For that perjury, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to different state charges and is now serving another five months at Rikers Island jail. Even if Trump is reelected, a president cannot use his pardon power to absolve state charges. Jonathan Karl of ABC News has reported that Trump was actively considering a pardon for Cohen around the time the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s house in 2018. Cohen ultimately spent weeks in solitary confinement for his tax and campaign finance crimes, something he has said was retribution by Trump \u2013 although a lawsuit Cohen filed making that allegation was dismissed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-prison-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_biden-older-voters-drug-prices", "text": "President Joe Biden is campaigning heavily on his efforts to lower health care costs, particularly for senior citizens, but his message may have yet to break through with many people in this key voting bloc. Many older voters remain unaware of the major provisions in the Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act that aim to lower drug costs for Medicare enrollees, according to a new KFF poll released Wednesday. This comes even though the president and others in the administration have highlighted the measures repeatedly, including in new ads running this week. Winning the support of senior citizens, a large and reliable voting group, will be important in November\u2019s presidential election. A number of polls show older voters are closely split between Biden and former President Donald Trump this year, with some giving Biden the edge \u2013 even though older Americans have favored Republicans in recent presidential elections. The KFF poll found that 48% of voters ages 65 and older are aware that Medicare has the power to negotiate the price of some prescription drugs. One bright spot for Biden is that share is up from 36% in November. Only 40% of older voters know there\u2019s a federal law that places an annual limit on out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare enrollees, up from 27% in November. And 15% of older voters are aware of the law that penalizes drug companies for increasing prices faster than inflation for those with Medicare coverage, up from 9% in November. Even when it comes to the $35 monthly cap on insulin costs for Medicare enrollees, one of Biden\u2019s most touted provisions that kicked in last year, only 52% of older voters are aware of the provision, roughly the same as in November. Some of the Inflation Reduction Act measures have yet to fully take effect, which may account for some of the lack of awareness. Medicare is in the midst of negotiating with drugmakers. The final prices will be released by September and won\u2019t take effect until January 2026. The annual $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on drug costs kicks in next year, though a more limited cap began in January. The KFF poll also found that large majorities of overall voters of both parties support extending several of the Inflation Reduction Act drug provisions to all adults with health insurance \u2013 which is what Biden has proposed. Trusting Biden on health care When it comes to trusting a candidate on health care issues, Biden ranks much higher than Trump among independent voters, another key group in the presidential election, according to the KFF poll. They trust Biden more to determine the future of the Affordable Care Act, ensure access to affordable health insurance and maintain protections for people with preexisting conditions by a 2-to-1 margin. Independent voters also trust Biden far more to determine the future of Medicare and Medicaid. As for addressing high health care costs, Biden has a narrower advantage over Trump, though about a third of independent voters don\u2019t trust either candidate. Among all voters, however, fewer than half say it\u2019s \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d likely that Biden\u2019s policies would lower prescription drug costs if he were reelected, while about 4 in 10 say the same about Trump. Older voters have more faith in Biden than Trump to determine the future of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. About half say they trust Biden more, while about a third trust Trump more. Voters overall are mixed in terms of who they trust more to handle the fate of these programs, KFF found. One Biden health care proposal that has a majority of support among voters of all parties is extending the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage, which are set to expire at the end of next year. Some 90% of Democratic voters, 73% of independent voters and 57% of Republican voters support extending the beefed-up subsidies, which were enacted as part of the Democrats\u2019 American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Abortion policy Some 62% of voters support guaranteeing a federal right to abortion, in line with Biden\u2019s views. And about 42% want to leave it up to individual states to decide whether abortion would be legal within their borders, as Trump has advocated. Looking at voters\u2019 views by party, 89% of Democratic voters and 62% of independent voters support a federal guarantee. Some 6 in 10 Republican voters would leave it up to the states, the KFF poll found.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/biden-older-voters-drug-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_joe-biden-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have both accepted an invitation from CNN to debate on June 27, a historically early showdown that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve received and accepted an invitation from @CNN for a debate on June 27th. Over to you, Donald. As you said: anywhere, any time, any place,\u201d Biden said in a post on X. Trump later told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, \u201cThe answer is yes, I will accept.\u201d Later Wednesday morning, both men said they had accepted an invitation from ABC to hold a second debate on September 10. The news is the latest development in a quickly escalating tit-for-tat over debates between the two political rivals. Biden\u2019s campaign earlier called on Trump to join him for two presidential debates hosted by news organizations and formally informed the Commission on Presidential Debates that the president will not participate in its previously scheduled fall debates. The former president quickly said he was on board with earlier debates and told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he would accept any moderator. Biden only recently said that he was happy to debate Trump, though he was non-committal on the format of such a debate, telling radio host Howard Stern, \u201cI\u2019m happy to debate him.\u201d In a social media video and a subsequent letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, Biden\u2019s campaign laid out its proposed terms, including possible debate dates in June and September. The video of Biden speaking directly to a camera released Wednesday morning was a more direct challenge. \u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then he hasn\u2019t shown up for a debate. Now he\u2019s acting like he wants to debate me again,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, make my day, pal, I\u2019ll even do it twice. So let\u2019s pick the dates, Donald \u2013 I hear you\u2019re free on Wednesdays,\u201d Biden continued, alluding to Trump\u2019s court schedule. In the letter, Biden\u2019s campaign acknowledged that the first debate would likely take place after Trump\u2019s criminal hush-money trial has concluded. In a post to Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump accepted the revised schedule: \u201cI am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September,\u201d adding that he would \u201cstrongly recommend\u201d more than the two debates proposed. A senior Trump adviser told CNN they are \u201cready to debate\u201d Biden, and reviewing the terms but are eager for an onstage match-up. Trump\u2019s team also called for the candidates to participate in four total debates - twice the number requested by Biden. The Biden campaign sidestepped questions about that request on Wednesday. \u201cPresident Biden didn\u2019t mince his words in the video,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, adding, \u201cHe said two debates \u2014 one in June, one in September, before voters began casting their votes \u2014\u00a0no spectacle, respect for the rules.\u201d Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates have taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. The Washington Post was first to report on those conversations. According to a news release from CNN, the debate will be held in the network\u2019s Atlanta studios with no audience present \u2013 an anomaly in debates between presidential candidates. The first televised presidential debates, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960, occurred in television studios with no live audience present. Debates did not take place again until the 1976 election, and from then on took place in front of live audiences who were instructed to not make noise aside from the beginning and ends of the debate. Moderators for the debate and additional details will come at a later time, the announcement said. The format is in line with a proposal from the Biden campaign to the commission in its letter, which Trump pushed back on in his Truth Social post, saying he would prefer, \u201cfor excitement purposes, a very large venue, although Biden is supposedly afraid of crowds.\u201d \u201cJust tell me when, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Foregoing traditional fall debates The Commission on Presidential Debates\u00a0announced\u00a0dates for three presidential debates last November. The first debate was scheduled for September 16 in Texas, the second on October 1 in Virginia and a third on October 9 in Utah. In the letter on Wednesday, Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said the campaign is proposing an altered schedule because the original dates are \u201cout of step with changes with changes in the structure of our elections and the interests of voters,\u201d pointing to the timeline of early voting, the way the commission has built debates as an \u201centertainment spectacle\u201d and the commission being \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to enforce rules in 2020 debates. The campaign also proposed that a vice presidential debate take place in late July after the Republican Party nominates its candidate for that position. The Biden campaign\u2019s decision to withdraw from the debates hosted by the commission is in line with a move made by the Republican National Committee two years ago. Back then, the RNC voted unanimously to withdraw from its participation in the nonpartisan\u00a0organization, alleging bias.\u00a0That withdrawal followed months of then-chairwoman Ronna McDaniel pressing the commission to change various practices on behalf of Trump. In a statement on Wednesday, the commission said it remained prepared to host its originally scheduled debates. \u201cOur 2024 sites, all locations of higher learning, are prepared to host debates on dates chosen to accommodate early voters,\u201d the commission said. \u201cWe will continue to be ready to execute this plan.\u201d The request for an earlier debate schedule could be seen as indicative of the campaign\u2019s desire to get voters involved in the political process as soon as possible. The campaign has repeatedly waved away negative polling by saying most Americans aren\u2019t tuned into the electoral process until much closer to the election. Calling for earlier debates might also help weed out third-party candidates that could cause problems for\u00a0both\u00a0Trump\u00a0and Biden.\u00a0Candidates need to meet certain criteria concerning ballot access, polling, and constitutional eligibility to qualify. Trump and Biden are all but certain to qualify but it\u2019s unclear if third-party candidates like Cornel West or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will meet the requirements.\u00a0The Commission on Presidential Debates won\u2019t determine who is eligible to participate in the debates until after Labor Day. A critical campaign moment For millions of Americans, the debates will represent the most extensive scrutiny they\u2019ll be able to give either candidate since the debates leading up to the 2020 election four years ago. The chance to see how both candidates preform will be critical for voters who are concerned about Biden and Trump\u2019s ages; Trump turns 78 on June 14, around the time when the campaign is proposing the first debate, while Biden turns 82 in November after the election. Republicans have for months been piling the pressure on Biden to debate Trump after the president offered non-committal answers on whether the face-offs would take place. Biden had previously conditioned debates with his predecessor, telling reporters, \u201cIt depends on his behavior,\u201d but declining to elaborate further. Trump\u2019s team is eager to get the former president on the debate stage as early as possible for a number of reasons, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN last month. The Trump campaign in April asked the\u00a0Commission on Presidential Debates for this year\u2019s general election debates to take place \u201cmuch earlier.\u201d The source cited that debates were scheduled to occur after early voting started in some areas, and they want Trump to be able to reach voters before they make a decision. This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_doj-republicans-democrats-what-matters", "text": "The long-standing allegation from former President Donald Trump is that President Joe Biden has weaponized the Department of Justice and that there is a double standard for Republicans as compared with Democrats. There\u2019s plenty of evidence otherwise lately. Sen. Bob Menendez, the up-for-reelection Democrat from New Jersey, is on trial for bribery for the second time in seven years \u2013 and across the street from where Trump\u2019s New York state trial related to hush money payments is taking place in Manhattan. Menendez denies the allegations, which include that he and his wife accepted gold bars, envelopes of cash and much more. In Texas, federal prosecutors have brought corruption charges against Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat, for allegedly taking nearly $600,000 in bribes, including from a foreign oil and gas company. Cuellar denies the allegations. Another Democrat, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, is the subject of a federal probe into her campaign spending, according to a CNN report in January. She has denied wrongdoing and defended paying her husband for security services. Evidence against the idea of political bias The cases above, if nothing else, are a serious complication to Trump\u2019s often-repeated claim that he is the subject of a partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d So is\u00a0prosecution of Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, in a gun case in Delaware that is rarely brought as a stand-alone charge, and a separate tax case in California. Both trials are slated to begin in June. Yes, Trump is the subject of two, distinct prosecutions brought by special counsel Jack Smith, concerning the former president\u2019s refusal to return classified material to the National Archives after he left the White House and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Both of those prosecutions are currently on hold. But it\u2019s worth noting that federal prosecutors passed on charging Trump for the hush money payments scheme that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg later pursued. An\u00a0unusually feisty Attorney General Merrick Garland\u00a0rejected any claim of bias during testimony on Capitol Hill last September. \u201cOur job is not to do what is politically convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress or from anyone else about who or what to criminally investigate.\u201d The Cuellar indictment, the Bush probe and the beginning of the Menendez trial are new developments to add to a running list of federal prosecutions I first compiled last year. Here\u2019s a look at active and recent federal cases against federal lawmakers and governors. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but it is what I could find going back to 2000 in CNN\u2019s coverage and from other news outlets. Ongoing federal cases against sitting federal lawmakers There is one against a Republican,\u00a0expelled Rep. George Santos\u00a0of New York, and two against Democrats, Menendez and Cuellar. No charges have yet been filed against Bush. There is also a non-prosecution to mention. Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, was informed last year by the DOJ that he\u00a0would not be charged\u00a0in a long-running sex trafficking probe. Federal cases against recent members of Congress These are federal cases against current or former federal lawmakers. I was able to find nine targeting Republicans and eight targeting Democrats. Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican from Nebraska\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Found guilty\u00a0in 2022 of three felonies in a case that centered on campaign contributions. Former Rep. TJ Cox, a Democrat\u00a0from California\u00a0\u2013 Still awaiting trial after his\u00a02022 indictment, including for fraudulent campaign contributions. He was offered a plea deal, according to local reports. Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican\u00a0from California\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 11 months in prison\u00a0for misusing\u00a0campaign funds, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Corrine\u00a0Brown, a Democrat\u00a0from Florida\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Served more than two years\u00a0for setting up a false charity. Former Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican\u00a0from Texas\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 10 years\u00a0in prison\u00a0for multiple felonies including fraud and money laundering, but\u00a0pardoned by Trump\u00a0after serving part of his sentence. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner, a Democrat from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 21 months\u00a0in prison\u00a0for sexting with a minor. Former Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat from Pennsylvania\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 10 years in prison\u00a0for racketeering, fraud and money laundering. Former Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican\u00a0from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Pleaded guilty and sentenced to eight months in prison\u00a0for tax evasion. Attempted to run again for Congress. Former Rep. Rick Renzi, a Republican from Arizona\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to three years for corruption. Pardoned by Trump after he served time. Sen. Bob Menendez, a\u00a0Democrat from New Jersey\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Acquitted by a judge and other charges dismissed\u00a0after a jury deadlocked in a bribery case that predates the current prosecution. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Illinois\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 30 months in prison\u00a0for misusing\u00a0campaign funds. Former Sen. Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Conviction by jury for lying on ethics forms was later set aside\u00a0over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Former Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat from Louisiana\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 13 years for corruption and soliciting bribes. There was video of him taking $100,000 from an African official. Served multiple years in prison, but many of the charges were later vacated by a judge based on\u00a0a US\u00a0Supreme Court decision. Former Rep. Bob Ney, a Republican from Ohio\u00a0\u2013 Sentenced to 30 months\u00a0after a guilty plea for corruption\u00a0tied to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Former Rep. Randy\u00a0\u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham, a Republican from California\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to eight years in prison after a guilty plea for bribery. Later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. James Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to eight years in prison\u00a0for corruption after defending himself during trial. Was later expelled from the House. Other prosecutions to consider Two Republican governors and two Democratic governors have been convicted in federal courts in recent decades: Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,\u00a0a Republican,\u00a0was convicted for bribery and corruption. But the US Supreme Court changed the rules in corruption and bribery cases when it\u00a0threw out the case against McDonnell. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat,\u00a0was convicted for trying to sell his power to appoint a replacement to Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat. His sentence was\u00a0later commuted by Trump. Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat,\u00a0was convicted by a jury\u00a0of bribery and corruption and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican,\u00a0was convicted on corruption charges after an FBI sting. Did we miss a federal lawmaker convicted or charged? Let me know at zachary.wolf@cnn.com. What\u2019s not included here Local prosecutions \u2013 like the state or local cases against\u00a0former Rep. Trey Radel, the Republican from Florida, for cocaine possession in Washington, DC, or former\u00a0Sen. Larry Craig, the Republican from Idaho, for lewd behavior in the Minneapolis airport \u2013 don\u2019t really fit here since they were not conducted by the Department of Justice. Some notable recent DOJ prosecutions have focused on Democrats at the state level, like Andrew Gillum, the Democrat and former Tallahassee, Florida, mayor who ran for governor and lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2018. Gillum was\u00a0acquitted of lying to the FBI. Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, also a Democrat, was\u00a0sentenced to three years in prison\u00a0after she pleaded guilty to charges related to a scheme in which local nonprofit organizations bought her self-published children\u2019s book. Trump charges Trump likes to argue he\u2019s the subject of a conspiratorial \u201cwitch hunt\u201d engineered by a deep state. Why, he will often say, was Hillary Clinton not prosecuted for her email server while he is being prosecuted\u00a0for mishandling classified material? This forgets the history of the 2016 election, which Clinton has said she lost because of then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation of her emails. Comey did not charge her before the election but did criticize her, and then, 11 days before Election Day, he said the investigation had been reopened.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_us-intelligence-china-iran-deepfakes-2020-election", "text": "Operatives working for the Chinese and Iranian governments prepared fake, AI-generated\u00a0content\u00a0as part of\u00a0a campaign to influence US voters in the closing weeks of the 2020 election campaign, current and former US officials briefed on the intelligence told CNN. The Chinese and Iranian operatives never disseminated the deepfake\u00a0audio or video publicly, but the previously unreported intelligence demonstrates concerns US officials had four years ago about the willingness of foreign powers to amplify false information about the voting process. The National Security Agency collected the intelligence that gave US officials insights into China and Iran\u2019s capabilities in producing deepfakes, one of the sources said. Now, with deepfake audio and video much easier to produce and the presidential election just six months away, US officials have grown more concerned over how a foreign influence campaign might exploit artificial intelligence to mislead voters. At an exercise in the White House Situation Room last December in preparation for the 2024 election, senior US officials wrestled with how to respond to a scenario where Chinese operatives\u00a0create a fake AI-generated video\u00a0depicting\u00a0a Senate candidate destroying ballots, as CNN has\u00a0previously reported. At a briefing last week, FBI officials\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI increases the ability of foreign states to spread election disinformation. It\u2019s unclear what was depicted in the deepfakes that the Chinese and Iranian operatives prepared in 2020, according to the sources, or why they were not ultimately deployed during that election. At the time, some US officials who reviewed the intelligence were unimpressed, believing it showed China and Iran lacked the capability to deploy deepfakes in a way that would seriously impact the 2020 presidential election, a former senior US official told CNN. \u201cThe technology has to be good; I don\u2019t think it was that good,\u201d the former official said. \u201cSecondly, you have to have a risk appetite. China, no. Iran, probably yes.\u201d Sources pointed to no evidence of coordination between the two countries. Keeping an eye on adversaries The NSA has continued to collect intelligence on foreign adversaries developing deepfakes and the potential threat they pose to US elections now that the technology has advanced dramatically over the last four years, the former senior official added, pointing out that in 2020, there wasn\u2019t, for example, a large language model like ChatGPT that was easy to use. The NSA declined to comment. US officials have maintained a high level of visibility into the AI and deepfake advancements made by countries including China, Iran and Russia since the 2020 election. But putting that intelligence to use inside the US remains a challenge, the former official said. \u201cThe question becomes how quickly can we spot an anomaly and then share that rapidly within the United States,\u201d the former official told CNN. \u201cAre we winning the race against a series of adversaries that might operate within the US? That\u2019s the challenge.\u201d The threat of deepfakes and foreign influence is poised to come up in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday, when lawmakers will get a rare opportunity to publicly interrogate the director of national intelligence and other senior officials on foreign threats to elections. \u201cOther adversarial nations know that it is relatively easy and, frankly, cheap to try to interfere in our election,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Mark Warner,\u00a0a Democrat who chairs\u00a0the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN\u2019s John Berman Wednesday morning.\u00a0\u201cI think we should expect China, Russia, Iran, potentially other nation-states to try to both either cyberattack our infrastructure or, more likely, spread misinformation to try to pit Americans against Americans.\u201d While they didn\u2019t deploy their deepfakes in 2020, Iranian government operatives did undertake a brazen attempt that year to influence voters by imitating the far-right Proud Boys group and disseminating\u00a0a video\u00a0purporting to show the hack of a\u00a0US voter registration database, according to US prosecutors. \u201cThe fact that the Iranians pulled the Proud Boys crap but didn\u2019t try deep fakes was either a lack of faith in the capabilities or a sign of no clear internal guidance,\u201d one person familiar with the intelligence told CNN. Lost in translation For foreign influence operations to be effective, they also need to resonate with the American public, something China has struggled with, the former senior US official said. \u201cI think it\u2019s clearly a cultural piece,\u201d the former official said. \u201cThey really have a very difficult understanding of the issues that that are divisive or necessarily how to play to those issues, where the Russians do not.\u201d Generative AI, or AI used to create video, audio, imagery or text, has made foreign influence actors more efficient in creating content, but \u201cthere is no evidence that it has made them or their campaigns any more effective,\u201d said Lee Foster, an expert in tracking foreign influence operations online. \u201cGenerative AI has so far not helped actors resolve the main bottleneck they face: distribution,\u201d said Foster, who is a co-founder of AI security firm Aspect Labs. \u201cActors have rarely struggled with creating content. Getting it in front of the right eyeballs at a meaningful scale has been and continues to be the sticking point, one that AI so far has not helped them overcome.\u201d Foster and other experts have\u00a0cautioned\u00a0against exaggerating the impact of foreign influence operations, including those that use AI, because it benefits the propagandists themselves. Disinformation in the US But the US remains fertile ground for conspiracy theories, whether domestic or foreign in origin. Nearly 70% of Republicans and Republican-leaners said that President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win was not legitimate, according to a CNN\u00a0poll\u00a0released in August. And positive views of many government institutions are \u201cat historic lows,\u201d with just 16% of the public saying they trust the federal government always or most of the time, according to a Pew Research Center survey released in September. \u201cAmericans, for whatever reason, are a lot more willing to believe crazy conspiracy theories and a lot less willing to accept, as truth, things coming from the federal government,\u201d Warner said on CNN Wednesday. The 2024 US election will present new opportunities for foreign influence operations. US military aid to Ukraine is essentially on the line, with Democrats largely backing Biden\u2019s support for Ukraine and some leading Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, increasingly backing away from foreign aid. FBI officials are concerned that the war in Ukraine \u2013 and US support for Kyiv \u2014 might be an \u201canimating event for the Russians\u201d in terms of conducting interference or influence operations aimed at the US election, a senior FBI official told reporters last week.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_biden-administration-new-israel-arms-deal", "text": "The Biden administration on Tuesday began the early stages of a process to move ahead with a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel, according to two congressional sources. The State Department has now opened discussions with the\u00a0House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees about the possible sale due to the informal notification on Tuesday. \u00a0There is no set timeline for when Congress would officially be notified of the sale, setting into motion a clock for its approval. The decision to get the wheels in motion for this new weapons deal comes as the Biden administration has paused the shipment\u00a0of 2,000-pound bombs and 500-pound bombs to Israel, citing opposition to the weapons being used in the densely populated areas of Rafah. The potential\u00a0new $1 billion arms sale would\u00a0include the potential transfer of $700 million in tank ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar rounds, one of the congressional sources confirmed. The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the administration\u2019s discussions with Congress about this sale. The weapons under discussion would not arrive in Israel imminently. The sale would still need to be officially notified to Congress and receive congressional approval, which could be a lengthy process, potentially drawn out by congressional objections. While US officials have said that other cases of weapons shipments to Israel would be under review, they have also said that the US will continue to make sure that Israel\u00a0has the military capacity to defend itself, indicating that longer-term weapons deals are not going to be halted at this time. \u201cWe are continuing to send military assistance, and we will ensure that Israel receives the full amount provided in the supplemental.\u00a0We have paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs because we do not believe they should be dropped in densely populated cities.\u00a0We are talking to the Israeli government about this,\u201d national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_us-intelligence-russia-disinformation-zelensky", "text": "Russia has stepped up its disinformation efforts to discredit Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky and raise questions about his legitimacy\u00a0in recent months,\u00a0US intelligence agencies have observed. A recently downgraded intelligence\u00a0assessment\u00a0shared with CNN\u00a0says\u00a0that Russia has seized on various recent events to fuel criticism about Zelensky\u2019s abilities and place as Ukraine\u2019s leader, a senior Biden administration official\u00a0said\u00a0in an interview. Russia has\u00a0spread\u00a0disinformation\u00a0about Zelensky since before the war started but recent intelligence shows\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s definitely increasing,\u201d the official said. The escalation of Moscow\u2019s efforts\u00a0comes as\u00a0Ukrainian forces\u00a0struggle\u00a0to hold the line against a spike in Russian attacks in northeastern Ukraine,\u00a0but the trend had been growing for months prior and is a reflection of Zelensky\u2019s general\u00a0\u201cformidability\u201d as a\u00a0wartime\u00a0president for over two years, the official argued. \u201cI would actually connect this disinformation effort to President Zelensky\u2019s effectiveness across this conflict in remaining a stable, dedicated and critically important leader of his country,\u201d said the official,\u00a0who requested anonymity to discuss the intelligence. Russia has\u00a0highlighted\u00a0two main areas in this recent disinformation push, the intelligence\u00a0indicates: Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0painful withdrawal\u00a0from the eastern city of Avdiivka and the fact that Ukraine postponed its\u00a0presidential election\u00a0scheduled for this Spring due to the war. Russia suffered huge losses of\u00a0troops to take Avdiivka but their eventual victory underscored Ukraine\u2019s shortage of\u00a0Western ammunition and its difficulties in defending the 1000km-long front line. Zelensky\u00a0said\u00a0the Ukrainian withdrawal was ordered to avoid being surrounded and save his soldiers\u2019 lives. The Russian narrative now being propagated, the official said, was that it was not a strategic Ukrainian decision but \u201crather to assign other motives,\u201d the official said, without spelling out the Russian messaging. When Russia launched its invasion in late February 2022, Zelensky\u00a0imposed\u00a0martial law, which was approved by Ukraine\u2019s parliament. Since then it has regularly been extended and the presidential election that was due to be held this\u00a0year\u00a0has been postponed. But Russians have used the delayed election to push an argument that Ukrainians will question Zelensky\u2019s legitimacy, something that has been\u00a0voiced\u00a0by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman. Zelensky had previously\u00a0rejected\u00a0the narrative as a \u201cRussian program.\u201d Concerned about impact abroad The\u00a0US is\u00a0more\u00a0concerned about the impact\u00a0of the disinformation\u00a0on countries abroad\u00a0than on Ukrainians\u2019 confidence in Zelensky,\u00a0the official said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re briefing our allies and partners about this,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe want to make sure that this type of Russian disinformation doesn\u2019t take hold and other countries that might not realize,\u00a0\u2018Oh, of course, they can\u2019t hold elections because they\u2019re in a state of martial law as a consequence of Russia\u2019s war.\u2019\u201d Biden administration officials regularly mention the increased pace of publicly released downgraded intelligence to\u00a0warn about Russian actions and plans. The administration has also imposed\u00a0sanctions\u00a0against individuals and entities connected with Russian disinformation. Both Ukraine and Russia have been involved in disinformation efforts against each other for years. So their impact now is questionable, particularly this far into the war, says\u00a0Gavin Wilde, a former National Security Council official who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cI am skeptical,\u201d Wilde said, \u201cthat all of these narratives are doing much other than merely preaching to the already converted.\u201d \u201c[Russia\u2019s] always been trying to besmirch Zelensky and two plus years into this war there\u2019s probably not a lot of fence sitters who are kind of left to be swayed by a nudge to the left or right about Zelensky holding elections or Ukrainian forces holding on Avdiivka,\u201d he added. Which Russian security agency is behind these efforts is unclear,\u00a0but US officials believe that its intelligence services are involved while also noting that a lot of Russian disinformation often comes bottom up from pro-Russian non-official groups. \u201cRussia is using its typical platforms, both traditional and state media, intelligence services and the proxies that they seek to operate, and social media to spread this messaging,\u201d said\u00a0the official. Ukraine is facing a dire moment in which its forces are diminished and stretched thin while desperately needed\u00a0Western military aid isn\u2019t arriving as quickly as it is needed. Russian advances are expected to further pull Ukrainian troops away from lines they have been defending while Russia\u2019s military industry far outpaces the\u00a0West\u2019s ability to arm Ukraine will critical artillery ammunition. Still, the US official argued, Russia\u2019s inability to achieve its military objectives has energized\u00a0its\u00a0disinformation efforts that the US believes\u00a0will\u00a0keep growing. \u201cWe view this as a natural evolution, or a logical evolution, in Russia\u2019s tactics,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u00a0\u201cNot only have we seen these disinformation efforts increasing but we also expect them to continue to increase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/us-intelligence-russia-disinformation-zelensky/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_takeaways-day-17-trump-hush-money-trial-michael-cohen", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche began his confrontation with Michael Cohen on Tuesday by throwing the former fixer\u2019s language back in his face. Blanche confirmed the two had never spoken, but asked Cohen whether he knew who he was already, since Cohen \u201cwent on TikTok and called me a crying little sh*t\u201d just before the trial began. \u201cSounds like something I would say,\u201d responded Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer. The question set the tone for the cross-examination of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s key witness in the hush money trial against the former president. For roughly two hours, Blanche began a cross-examination to try to discredit Cohen\u2019s allegations against Trump. But after the initial fireworks over Cohen\u2019s TikTok post, much of his cross-examination Tuesday was more subdued, as Blanche quizzed him on the many compliments he gave Trump when he was still a loyal fixer and the money he\u2019s made from books and podcasts since turning against him. Cohen did not get rattled when his nasty statements were read back to him, and Trump hardly reacted to his lawyer\u2019s interrogation. Still, there\u2019s a long way to go \u2013 Blanche indicated the cross-examination would continue through most of the day Thursday, when court resumes. Over two days, Cohen has\u00a0detailed the hush money scheme\u00a0involving adult film actress\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u00a0before the 2016 election, walked\u00a0the jury\u00a0through the $130,000 he paid at Trump\u2019s direction and described his fallout with the former president. Cohen\u2019s testimony ties together the prosecution\u2019s allegations that\u00a0Trump broke the law by falsifying business records\u00a0to reimburse Cohen and conceal the payment. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having an affair with Daniels. If Cohen gets off the stand Thursday, the prosecution appears poised to rest its case against Trump. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass confirmed to Judge Juan Merchan on Tuesday that Cohen is the final witness for the prosecution. Here are the takeaways from Day 17 of the Trump hush money trial: Blanche tries to use Cohen\u2019s words to discredit him Blanche\u2019s opening question was just the first in a series of colorful quotes from Cohen that Blanche raised to jurors to try to paint Cohen as someone who hated Trump and who was hellbent on getting revenge while making money off the former president and trying to get his prison sentence reviewed. Blanche had plenty of material to work with. Cohen has written two books, \u201cDisloyal\u201d and \u201cRevenge,\u201d and has recorded hundreds of podcasts \u2013 confirming he mentions Trump in every episode of \u201cMea Culpa.\u201d Regarding Cohen\u2019s first podcast in 2020, Blanche asked whether he called Trump a \u201cboorish cartoon misogynist.\u201d \u201cSounds like something I would say,\u201d Cohen responded again. Blanche then asked whether Cohen called Trump a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d \u201cThat also sounds like something that I said,\u201d Cohen said. Blanche fired more lines at Cohen, asking whether he said on his podcast in 2020: \u201cI truly f***ing hope Donald Trump ends up in prison.\u201d \u201cSounds more like my language on \u2018Mea Culpa,\u2019\u201d Cohen responded. Blanche then asked Cohen to listen to audio from the podcast, which Cohen, the judge, the lawyers and Trump all put on headphones to hear. Blanche continued by asking Cohen how much money he had made from his books, his podcasts and the TikTok account he launched six months ago. The upshot of the questioning was that Cohen was making a living off attacking Trump after he lost his law license following his 2018 guilty plea to charges including campaign finance violations linked to the hush money scheme. Cohen tried to put another spin on it. Asked what his goal was of putting out a TikTok nearly every night, he said: \u201cBuild an audience, to create a community, to really vent because I have a difficult time sleeping, so I found an outlet.\u201d The tug-of-war over Cohen\u2019s words is sure to continue into Thursday as Blanche tries to convince the jury not to trust Cohen\u2019s allegations related to the case itself. Blanche questions Cohen on his drastically shifting views about Trump Blanche took Cohen through the evolution of the former fixer\u2019s feelings about Trump, pinpointing the shift from admiration to hatred in the summer of 2018, when Cohen turned on his former boss. Asked whether he was \u201cobsessed\u201d with Trump, Cohen said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say obsessed. I admired him tremendously.\u201d He went on, \u201cI can\u2019t recall using that word. I wouldn\u2019t say it would be wrong.\u201d Cohen also used his admiration to try to explain his shift, responding to a series of questions about the nice things he had said about Trump by saying: \u201cAt that time I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump, yes.\u201d Blanche read a list of compliments Cohen paid Trump publicly in 2015 and 2016, including calling Trump \u201ca good man,\u201d \u201ca man who cares deeply about his family\u201d and \u201ca man who tells it straight.\u201d Throughout cross-examination Blanche asked Cohen pointed questions about when he was telling the truth or lying when it came to Trump. \u201cYou were telling the truth, correct?\u201d Blanche asked in regards to the compliments Cohen gave Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s how I felt,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI was expressing my feelings, so yes, it would be the truth.\u201d Cohen confirmed his feelings about Trump changed in the summer of 2018 around the time he pleaded guilty to federal charges. Trump\u2019s attorney pushed Cohen on his motivations since turning on the former president, suggesting Cohen is now driven by revenge and money. Blanche quoted an excerpt of Cohen\u2019s book \u201cDisloyal\u201d to him: \u201cI wanted it all: power, the good life, public acclaim, fame, big deals, fast cars, private planes, the excess and glamor and zest for life.\u201d \u201cThose are my words, yes,\u201d Cohen confirmed. There were no fireworks from Trump or Cohen on Tuesday afternoon during the cross-examination. Trump\u2019s former fixer kept his measured manner for the more than two hours of questioning from Blanche. Trump, meanwhile, rarely engaged with Cohen\u2019s testimony. He turned to Cohen initially when Blanche began but spent most of the time with his eyes closed, appearing to zone out, with his mouth hanging open at some points. Occasionally, Trump would look in Cohen\u2019s direction, craning his neck at one point when Cohen was asked whether he lied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office in 2018. Cohen walks jurors through his decision to cease being loyal to Trump In the morning, prosecutors wrapped up their questioning of Cohen, walking him in detail through his decision to stop being loyal to Trump \u2013 and to stop lying for Trump \u2013 when he pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018. Cohen explained that he lied on Trump\u2019s behalf to Congress in 2017 during the Russia investigation, and that he was \u201cmisleading\u201d when he told the Federal Election Commission about the $130,000 payment to Daniels in a 2018 letter. After he sent the letter to the FEC in February 2018, Cohen testified that Trump\u2019s then-attorney Jay Sekulow sent him a message saying, \u201cClient says thanks for what you do.\u201d Cohen confirmed that the client was Trump. Throughout the testimony explaining the events leading up to his guilty plea, Cohen described how he was given reassurance from Trump\u2019s allies \u2013 and Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 that his loyalty was appreciated and that he should not \u201cflip\u201d on Trump. After the FBI seized Cohen\u2019s phones and records in a search warrant in 2018, \u201cI received a phone call from President Trump,\u201d he testified. \u201cI wanted obviously him to know what was taking place. And he said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m the president of the United States. There\u2019s nothing here. Everything\u2019s going to be OK. Stay tough.\u2019\u201d It was the last time they spoke, Cohen said. Ultimately, Cohen described how a conversation with his family in August 2018 convinced him to change his tune, plead guilty and tell the truth about Trump, he said. \u201cI made a decision based again on the conversation I had with my family that I would not lie for President Trump anymore.\u201d Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger used several questions to walk Cohen through his flip-flops of past statements on issues such as his federal tax charges in an attempt to get ahead of the cross-examination sure to keep the focus on those discrepancies. She ended her questioning of Cohen by asking him whether he regretted his past association with Trump. \u201cI regret doing things for him that I should not have, lying, bullying people in order to effectuate a goal,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI don\u2019t regret working with the Trump Organization. As I expressed before, some very interesting, great times. But to keep the loyalty and to do the things that he had asked me to do, I violated my moral compass, and I suffered the penalty, as has my family.\u201d More Trump allies flock to court Trump\u2019s Manhattan courtroom seems to be the hottest club in New York for aspiring Republican politicians. Last week, it was Florida Sen. Rick Scott who joined Trump in court. On Monday, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio was sitting two rows behind the former president. Tuesday saw the biggest group of politicians \u2013 and at least one potential VP candidate \u2013 make the trek up to the 15th floor of the Manhattan courthouse to show their support of Trump. The list included Trump\u2019s onetime presidential-rival-turned-VP-hopeful North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, along with House Speaker Mike Johnson, Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills, and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. All were seated behind Trump for much of the day except for Johnson, who appeared in the hallway with Trump for his morning news conference but did not go inside the courtroom. (The Louisiana Republican\u2019s office said he went into the overflow room before he held a news conference outside the courthouse.) Lara Trump, Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law and the new co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also attended court Tuesday, along with Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump, who has become a semi-regular presence in the courtroom over the past two weeks. At one point, when the politicians reentered the courtroom after giving a news conference outside before lunch, the judge stared at them, looking annoyed, as they took their seats while Cohen was in the middle of testifying. At their news conference outside, the Republican politicians all denounced the proceedings they had come to witness, just as those who have come before them have done. \u201cI learned a lot from being in there in person,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cIt is one of the most depressing places I have been in my life, but it is fitting because the only thing more depressing than the environment of that courtroom is what\u2019s actually happening in there.\u201d Trump acknowledged Tuesday morning that he appreciated the show of support. \u201cI do have a lot of surrogates and they are speaking very beautifully,\u201d Trump said before going into court.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_jack-teixeira-new-charges-air-force", "text": "US Air Force prosecutors have asked for new charges against the Massachusetts Air National guardsman who pleaded guilty in federal court earlier this year to leaking highly classified intelligence reports and other documents on social media, according to the Air Force. During a hearing at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts on Tuesday, Air Force prosecutors asked a hearing officer to recommend charges of disobeying an order and obstructing justice against Jack Teixeira under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Teixeira, 22, was arrested in April 2023 and\u00a0pleaded guilty in March\u00a0to all six counts he faced under the Espionage Act. Prosecutors have said they will ask a judge to impose a prison sentence of over 16 years.\u00a0The final sentence will ultimately be decided by a federal judge in September. CNN reported earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0the Air\u00a0Force\u00a0would pursue separate charges under the UCMJ. Because Teixiera was on active duty orders at the time that he admitted to leaking classified documents, the Air Force argued that he was subject to both criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice and under the UCMJ. Prosecutors alleged that while working at a Cape Cod airbase, Teixeira posted messages that included classified information in a Discord chat room called \u201cThug Shaker Central\u201d before eventually posting photos of documents marked as classified.

Jean Carroll have asked a federal appeals court to expedite Donald Trump\u2019s appeal of the verdict in their first trial in which a jury awarded Carroll $5 million in damages after finding Trump liable for defamation and battery in May 2023. Carroll wants to see the oral arguments for the appeal scheduled to take place by July, arguing that the former president will try to further delay the proceedings, using his ongoing criminal trial or busy campaign schedule as an excuse. The motion with the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals filed Tuesday cites Trump\u2019s numerous attempts to delay both trials with Carroll as a signal that he\u2019s likely to drag out the appeal. \u201cDonald J. Trump has demonstrated a clear pattern of dilatory, obstructionist, and bad faith conduct throughout these proceedings. With the pendency of the general presidential election campaign (which will intensify in the fall), not to mention several active state and federal criminal proceedings, Mr. Trump may well contend that any oral argument scheduled for later in 2024 must be deferred until early 2025 \u2013 at which point he could be preparing for an inauguration or awaiting another criminal trial,\u201d the motion says. Carroll\u2019s lawyers argue an expedited appellate ruling on the first case would help promote a timely resolution in Trump\u2019s separate appeal of the verdict in the second trial between Carroll and Trump that hinged on the jury\u2019s decision in the first trial per a ruling from the judge who presided over both trials. The jury in the second trial held in January determined Trump should pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages for defaming her. Her lawyers also asked the appeals court to consider the author\u2019s progressing age. \u201cMs. Carroll is an 80-year-old woman who has struggled mightily to obtain justice for almost five years,\u201d the filing says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/e-jean-carroll-expedite-trump-appeal-defamation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Bob Menendez will not allow a psychiatrist to testify at trial about a condition his defense attorneys say could explain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash investigators found during a raid of the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s home. The judge, Sidney Stein, made several rulings on witnesses Tuesday as testimony is expected to kick off in federal court in New York later this week. After two days of jury selection, Stein told the defense teams and prosecutors that he expects a jury to be selected and sworn in by the end of Wednesday morning, with opening statements beginning that afternoon.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_stormy-daniels-husband-trump-cnntv", "text": "The husband of adult film actress Stormy Daniels said on Tuesday that there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d the couple will leave the country if former President Donald Trump is acquitted in his Manhattan criminal trial. Barrett Blade spoke to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett about the vitriol his wife, who is a key figure in the controversy over a 2016 hush money payment allegedly made to Daniels on Trump\u2019s behalf, has faced. \u201c\u200b\u200bEither way, I don\u2019t think it gets better for her. I think if it\u2019s not guilty, we got to decide what to do. Good chance we\u2019ll probably vacate this country,\u201d Blade said on \u201cOutFront,\u201d adding that if Trump is found guilty, he believed Daniels would still face hate from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s supporters. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a win situation either way,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that we would like to get on with our lives. I know that she wants to move past this. We just want to do what I guess you\u2019d say normal people get to do in some aspects but I don\u2019t know if that ever will be, you know, and it breaks my heart. Daniels claims she had a one-night stand with Trump in 2006 and was paid off in 2016 to keep silent about the affair. Prosecutors allege that Trump broke the law by falsifying business records to reimburse his former lawyer Michael Cohen and conceal a \u201chush money\u201d payment made to Daniels on Trump\u2019s behalf. The controversy dates back to January 2018, when the Wall Street Journal reported on the $130,000 payment. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair. On the witness stand last week, Daniels described meeting Trump at a celebrity golf tournament, in addition to salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with him. She also testified about the interest that Trump and Cohen seemed to have had in buying her story after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape came out just before the 2016 election. During cross examination, Trump\u2019s lawyers attacked Daniels\u2019 credibility. Attorney Susan Necheles accused her of fabricating the alleged sexual encounter in order to make money. Daniels pushed back and insisted that she was telling the truth. \u201cIf that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better,\u201d Daniels said of her encounter with Trump. When asked by Burnett about the defense\u2019s claim that Daniels made up her story, Blade echoed his wife\u2019s comments, describing her as \u201ca brilliant writer,\u201d and adding that she would have written something \u201cway better than what she said about the Trump story.\u201d Blade also noted that Daniels just wants \u201cto get on with her life.\u201d \u201cAs much as it\u2019s boring for the media to keep hearing it over and over again, it sucks for her to have to keep saying the same thing over and over and over again,\u201d Blade said. \u201cIt wears on her, but she\u2019s a warrior.\u201d Blade also said that the hate his wife receives doesn\u2019t really matter to him because Daniels \u201cis used to all of this\u201d and that she was prepared because she continues to receive a lot of vitriol and negative comments on social media. \u201cThis is all her fighting for what she believes is right and telling the truth, and I don\u2019t think a lot of people realize that,\u201d he continued.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_supreme-court-louisiana-black-voters-congressional-district", "text": "The Supreme Court paused a chaotic legal fight over\u00a0Louisiana\u2019s congressional districts\u00a0in a brief order Wednesday that will likely allow the state to use a map in this year\u2019s election that creates a second majority-Black district and benefits Democrats. The court\u2019s three liberal justices publicly dissented from the decision. In the short term, the decision allows the state to move forward in this year\u2019s election with a map that will make a second of its six districts competitive for Democrats. That could have enormous consequences given the razor-thin majority Republicans have in the US House of Representatives. Louisiana state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Democrat and former member of Congress running in the new Black-majority district crafted by state lawmakers, said the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas the outcome that was needed for the state.\u201d \u201cThe people of Louisiana now know what their congressional lines look like,\u201d he told CNN. On that point, at least, Fields and other Democrats in the state were aligned with Republican officials and a group of Black voters who had asked for the court\u2019s intervention. In a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said that she was grateful the Supreme Court ensured \u201da stable election season.\u201d Although Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state currently has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its current six-member US House delegation. But the decision may represent something of a pyrrhic\u00a0victory for voting rights groups who fear the court\u2019s justification for allowing the new map could have far-reaching consequences in future redistricting battles. The ruling will have an impact beyond the Louisiana district, which likely explains the vote count, said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck. \u201cThis ruling is a short-term win for Black voters in Louisiana, and, thus, Democrats, but a long-term expansion of a deeply controversial approach to how federal courts handle election-year voting cases \u2013 which is a big part of why the justices seem to all have ended up in unpredictable positions here,\u201d said Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Purcell principle politics Louisiana officials specifically asked the Supreme Court last week to rely on a legal doctrine\u00a0known as the Purcell principle, which it sometimes invokes to stay out of last-minute election lawsuits. The majority cited Purcell in its brief order Wednesday but did not otherwise explain its reasoning. The Supreme Court has never defined what constitutes a \u201clast-minute\u201d election decision that should bar courts from weighing into such disputes. And the court\u2019s conservatives have faced blowback in recent years for applying that doctrine in a way critics see as inconsistent. Louisiana won\u2019t hold its congressional primary election until November. In a brief dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said it was premature for the Supreme Court to intervene in the case. She said that Purcell \u201chas no role to play here.\u201d \u201cRather than wading in now, I would have let the District Court\u2019s remedial process run its course before considering whether our emergency intervention was warranted,\u201d Jackson wrote. Jackson, in other words, would have waited for the lower courts or the state Legislature to draw a new map. \u201cOne of the biggest criticisms of Purcell is that it\u2019s deeply subjective with regard to how close to an election federal courts should stay their hand,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling only compounds that critique, because it expressly applies it more than five months before an election without any explanation for why. That will make Purcell both broader and more malleable in lower courts going forward.\u201d Case watched for how Supreme Court looks at redistricting and gerrymandering The new district at issue in the case slashes diagonally from Shreveport in the northwest of the state to Baton Rouge in the southeast for some 250 miles to create a district where Black residents make up some 54% of the district\u2019s voters \u2013 up from about 24% under the old lines. The map lawmakers approved carved up the district of Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who had endorsed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s opponent in last year\u2019s gubernatorial primary. The case has been watched closely by civil rights groups and election experts for its potential national impact. At its most basic level, the proposed map would give Democrats a chance to add a second member to their delegation. But the fight also implicates deeper and more long-standing controversies that could reach beyond the Bayou State, including how the Supreme Court handles similar redistricting cases and how state mapmakers are supposed to consider race as they eke as much political advantage as they can from the boundaries of each district they draw. Louisiana came to the Supreme Court caught between two lower court orders. One court said state lawmakers likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing only one majority-Black district out of six. A second court found the state\u2019s attempt to fix the problem with a second majority-Black district was unconstitutional because lawmakers relied on race in a way that violated the equal protection clause. The second map was challenged by a group of voters who have identified themselves in court as \u201cnon-African American,\u201d though the list of plaintiffs includes a number of prominent White Republicans. Those voters argued their \u201cpersonal dignity\u201d was injured because the new map with two majority-Black districts \u201cracially stigmatizes,\u201d \u201cracially stereotypes\u201d and \u201cracially maligns\u201d them. Caught in the middle was a group of Black voters who felt the new map, while imperfect, was at least better than the one used in the 2022 midterm elections that included only a single majority-Black district. Two years ago, the Supreme Court allowed that map to be used in the midterm even though a lower court said it was likely illegal. The Black voters and Republican Louisiana officials both urged the Supreme Court to step in and pause the lower court proceedings \u2013 arguing the state needed an answer on which map to use by today. But the White voters said there was plenty of time for the state legislature or the lower court to draw a new map. \u201cOur fight for a fair congressional map has carried on for years,\u201d\u00a0Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cToday, we celebrate our communities\u2019 opportunity to have a voice in this year\u2019s elections, that can lead to the representation we need to make positive change in the years ahead. This is a day for hope.\u201d The attorneys for the voters who challenged the map with the two Black-majority districts said they are confident they ultimately will prevail if the Supreme Court agrees to hear an appeal on the merits of the case. \u201cThe state of Louisiana enacted a brutal racial gerrymander that segregates its voters based on their race,\u201d Edward Greim and Paul Hurd said in a joint statement. \u201cAs a result, their constituents may well vote in November 2024 districts segregated by race.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/supreme-court-louisiana-black-voters-congressional-district/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In an election year oddity, both the prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, and the judge presiding over the case, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, are fighting to keep their seats. \u201cThey probably a little nervous,\u201d Willis said with a nod to her\u00a0team\u00a0as she took the stage at a recent Democratic Party awards dinner. \u201cThey write all these speeches and then I say what I wanna say.\u201d Such is the high-wire act for the district attorney and the judge as they juggle their campaigns with their court calendars. Even though both incumbents are favored to win, their upcoming elections\u00a0add\u00a0a\u00a0layer of uncertainty to the election interference case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants. The case is effectively at a standstill. It was sidetracked for months over whether Willis should be disqualified from the case after she had a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor. She managed to stay\u00a0on while he\u00a0resigned. But now an appeals court said it will revisit the question of whether Willis should have been removed from the case. A legal argument before the Supreme Court over whether Trump has immunity from prosecution also remains an issue in the Georgia case and may not be decided until this summer. Willis is facing off in the Democratic primary against Christian Wise Smith, an attorney who failed to gain traction in his two previous bids for public office.\u00a0And while the disqualification issue has been fodder for Willis\u2019 critics on the right, she remains the favorite among Democrat voters. Wise Smith, meantime, has faced some skepticism from voters worried that if he ousts Willis it could endanger the Trump case. McAfee is up against criminal defense attorney and talk radio host Robert Patillo in the nonpartisan judicial race. If Patillo prevails, he\u2019s expected to take over the cases on McAfee\u2019s docket, which could include the Trump election interference case. Both races are on the\u00a0Fulton County\u00a0ballot May 21.

And every remark is potential fodder for the defendants. \u201cAin\u2019t no one above the law, either,\u201d Willis said at a recent campaign stop where she was endorsed by faith leaders. \u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t care how rich you are, how powerful you think you are, who your daddy is, what your political party might be, how much money you think you got and how evil your supporters are.\u201d She added: \u201cI will gladly leave this place knowing that I did God\u2019s work.\u201d Despite Willis\u2019 defiant tone, she\u2019s dodged specific questions about the Trump case at public events and backed out of an April debate\u00a0with Wise Smith,\u00a0noting that she would be unable to talk about the highest-profile case on her plate. The disqualification drama surrounding Willis hasn\u2019t spared Wise Smith from skepticism from some Democrats who believe Willis will most aggressively prosecute the Trump case. \u201cSome folks were worried that me jumping in the race, you know, might mean we lose that case,\u201d Wise Smith said in an interview\u00a0with CNN.\u00a0His counter: electing a prosecutor with less personal baggage would be beneficial to the case and the county. But Wise Smith \u2013 who has campaigned on breaking the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d and tapping more community resources to drive down crime \u2013 has also raised concerns about the resources devoted to sprawling, high-profile cases, such as the election interference case. \u201cWould I drop the case? Let me say this, I think the case is in grave jeopardy right now,\u201d Wise Smith said of the Trump case. \u201cI\u2019m not dropping it if it\u2019s there when I get there, but we are going to look at the best way to go forward with it.\u201d McAfee runs first campaign McAfee, who was appointed to his job in December 2022 to fill a retirement vacancy, has also been hitting the trail for his first campaign, appearing at local rotary clubs, churches and marching in the local Inman Park festival parade. In a rarity for a sitting judge, McAfee has also been granting interviews to local media. He offered one interviewer insight into his process of drafting the opinion he would eventually release declining to disqualify Willis from the case, as the judge insisted his rulings wouldn\u2019t be swayed by pressure from the campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve had a rough draft in an outline before I ever heard a rumor that someone wanted to run for this position, so the result is not going to change because of politics,\u201d McAfee told WSB radio in March. His opponent, Patillo, is primarily running on criminal justice reform and has taken aim at the pace of cases,\u00a0particularly given the violence and overcrowding at the local jail. Patillo\u2019s suggested McAfee isn\u2019t moving aggressively enough on the Trump case and critiqued the way the judge handled the hearings on the Willis disqualification matter, suggesting some of the more explosive testimony shouldn\u2019t have played out in open court. \u201cIn my courtroom and from my judicial philosophy, there would have a been a lot more things done in camera where we could have had these discussions behind closed doors,\u201d Patillo told CNN in an interview. At a recent candidates\u2019 forum, McAfee spent the evening glad-handing and defending his record of moving cases along \u2013 without addressing the Trump case specifically. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as just setting a trial date,\u201d McAfee said of docket management. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things that go into it pretrial and there\u2019s working in the case actively.\u201d Willis, McAfee way ahead in fundraising Both Willis and McAfee have outraised their opponents, according to the latest campaign finance reports.\u00a0Willis\u00a0has raised more than $550,000 compared to nearly $78,000 from Wise Smith. McAfee has raised more than $325,000 for his reelection bid, including a $100,000 loan he provided for his campaign. Patillo has raised just shy of $12,000. McAfee\u2019s coffers have been helped along by several players in the Trump case.\u00a0Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, were the marquee guests at a recent fundraising event for McAfee. Kemp could wind up being a witness in the Trump case. And Barnes was already a witness in the Willis disqualification issue. Ray Smith III, a Georgia lawyer and a defendant in the case, also donated to McAfee before Smith was indicted. The donations aren\u2019t barred under ethics rules, but Patillo slammed them, saying \u201cit creates the appearance of impropriety\u201d and \u201cit makes it seem like we\u2019re running a kangaroo court.\u201d McAfee told CNN that his opponent is running to \u201craise his profile.\u201d\u00a0 He said Patillo\u2019s \u201ccomments about the recent fundraiser miss the point of bringing together two persons from both sides of the aisle, which is to show support from across the political spectrum. I believe it reflects a bi-partisan appreciation for fairness.\u201d As for the $150 donation from Smith, McAfee said - and campaign filings confirm- he donated that contribution to the Boy Scouts. \u201cThe politicking, it\u2019s kind of unseemly that they have to do it,\u201d Moore said of the increasingly acrimonious judicial race. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the nature of the beast down there.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/fani-willis-trump-trial-judge-campaign-trail/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_cohen-trump-hush-money-analysis", "text": "\u201cJust do it.\u201d With three short words, more famous for selling sports gear than exposing conspiracies, star witness Michael Cohen on Monday depicted Donald Trump\u2019s order of a hush money payoff to an adult film star to allegedly save his 2016 campaign. Prosecutors will seek to build on his testimony when he returns to the stand Tuesday to nail down their case that the ex-president broke the law by falsifying financial records to hide the pay-off in the culmination of a scheme to mislead voters. All that will be a curtain raiser for what is looming as a savage cross-examination by the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s attorney, designed to shatter the reputation of Cohen, expose him as a liar and punish him for turning on his ex-boss. The biggest question before Monday was whether prosecutors had laid a prior foundation of corroborating evidence to which they could connect Cohen\u2019s testimony and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump acted criminally. \u201cI think they have it,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, citing fulsome evidence \u2013 such as logs of calls, including between Trump and Cohen, about the proposed payment and the lawyer\u2019s reimbursement, which prosecutors say led to the falsified financial documents. \u201cAs of today, it holds together.\u201d Trump has pleaded not guilty, and no one can say how a jury will interpret events at trial until the fateful moment when the foreperson delivers a verdict. But former New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d that Cohen, from his delivery to his eye contact with the prosecutor, had been \u201cexcellent\u201d on the stand and helped the prosecution. \u201cThey finally provided that link that Donald Trump authorized these payments and the payments were for the purposes of affecting that campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cMichael Cohen did deliver. \u2026 but we have to see how he stands up to cross examination.\u201d Given Cohen\u2019s past, including a conviction for lying to Congress, and his thwarted hopes of a job in Trump\u2019s administration offering a potential motive for revenge, the cross examination will be critical, said David Schoen, who represented Trump during his second impeachment. \u201cI think that they (the prosecution) feel he is a make-or-break witness. I think in real terms, he probably is,\u201d Schoen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cThis case is going to turn in large part on the cross-examination of Mr. Cohen. That ought to be a dream for a half-way competent lawyer.\u201d A pivotal day The most critical day of the trial so far saw the presumptive Republican nominee come face to face with Cohen, who says he squashed scandals and cleaned up busted business deals as his boss\u2019 ruthless fixer. It was another unfathomable episode in a 2024 election season that has been ensnared by Trump\u2019s legal quagmire but that could still end with him back in the White House. And while the courtroom action Monday will play a pivotal role in how the case turns out, there is a wider audience given how Trump\u2019s defense has morphed into a campaign rationale. It\u2019s too early to assess how voters might process a conviction or acquittal or whether damaging new revelations about his conduct will sway an electorate by now numb to scandals that would have doomed a normal candidate years ago. But fresh New York Times/Siena polls showing Trump leading President Joe Biden in multiple swing states underscore his very real hopes of a non-consecutive second term. And Cohen\u2019s descriptions Monday of the ex-president\u2019s way of doing business added to growing evidence that a second Trump administration would likely pose an even greater threat to the rule of law than his first spell in the White House. Trump is barred from publicly slamming Cohen and what he sees as his treachery because of a gag order imposed by a judge who has threatened jail if he won\u2019t comply following 10 previous violations. But the former president\u2019s tirade outside the courtroom Monday was even more irate than usual, as he lashed out at Judge Juan Merchan and bitterly claimed he was a victim of political victimization. \u201cThe whole world is laughing now at the New York, weaponized, legal system,\u201d he claimed. In a sense, testimony from Cohen \u2013 who has written that he was drawn to Trump before he ran for president because of his aura and fame \u2013 is a lesson in the contortions and legally questionable choices often faced by those in the ex-president\u2019s orbit. But there is no shortage of Republicans seeking to join him. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a vice presidential prospect, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville joined Trump outside the courtroom Monday morning, strutting like a posse behind a sheriff and reflecting his undimmed power in the GOP. Vance served as Trump\u2019s ungagged mouthpiece, seeking to discredit Cohen and showing his own credentials as a Trump defender as the ex-president mulls a list of running mates. \u201cDoes any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?\u201d the Ohio Republican asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he said, defending a presumptive GOP nominee who tried to overthrow a free and fair election in 2020. How the Trump and Cohen double act fractured During hours of testimony, the former president sat with his eyes often closed as Cohen, now on a journey of redemption after years of service to Trump ended in his own jail term, detailed a scheme to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had a sexual liaison with the then-reality television star and real estate magnate. (Trump denies the affair.) Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger spent a painstaking day slowly taking Cohen through his former role at the Trump Organization and his commitment to protecting his boss, with Cohen even going on television to lie and organizing schemes to silence alleged claims against Trump from other women. Hoffinger sought to establish that the payment to Daniels did take place, that Trump told Cohen to do it, that Cohen made the payment using a home equity line of credit to disguise it from his wife and that he expected to be reimbursed. Hoffinger also drew Cohen into testifying that the real reason Trump was worried about Daniels\u2019 claims \u2014 which emerged shortly after an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape came to light in 2016 in which he boasted about grabbing female genitals \u2014 was to protect his campaign rather than, as the defense will argue, to spare his family embarrassment. Cohen said that Trump told him: \u201cWomen are going to hate me. \u2026 Guys may think it\u2019s cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.\u201d He said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even thinking about Melania,\u201d referring to the former first lady. \u201cThis was all about the campaign.\u201d Cohen also testified that Trump said he would not be on the market for long, implying he could get another wife quickly. The ex-president smirked and shook his head after that comment. Throughout his testimony, Cohen said he always kept Trump up to speed with his activities. \u201cEverything required Mr. Trump\u2019s sign-off,\u201d he said, noting the Daniels payment was no exception. \u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, smart people, and \u2018That it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re a billionaire, just pay it. There\u2019s no reason to keep this thing out there so do it.\u2019 He expressed to me, \u2018just do it.\u2019\u201d Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors say this was done to hide monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 \u2014 after his boss became president \u2014 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels. In an apparent bid to neutralize an expected effort by the defense to argue that Cohen is lying because he bears a grudge against Trump, the prosecution asked him about his anger when his annual bonus was cut by two-thirds in December 2016. He testified that he was \u201cpissed off.\u201d Shortly afterwards, he went to Trump\u2019s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, to discuss the repayment of the $130,000 he had paid Daniels. Cohen also testified that he was disappointed not to be considered for Trump\u2019s first White House chief of staff. His testimony was quite the reversal for a man who previously wrote that he became a \u201cthug\u201d to carry out Trump\u2019s wishes and who said Monday of the client who spurned him: \u201cThe only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-hush-money-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_maryland-senate-race-democratic-primary", "text": "Angela Alsobrooks won Maryland\u2019s Democratic nomination for US Senate, advancing\u00a0her potentially history-making candidacy\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0competitive general election with implications for control of the chamber next year. The Prince George\u2019s County executive\u2019s victory is a stunning defeat of three-term Rep. David Trone, who loaned his campaign at least $61.77 million, breaking the record for self-funding a Senate primary campaign.\u00a0She\u2019ll face Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, whose entrance into the race earlier this year shook up the Senate battlefield.\u00a0Hogan easily won his primary Tuesday. With Republicans already poised to flip a Senate seat in West Virginia, the party only needs to pick up one or two more seats, depending on who wins the White House, to secure the majority. That\u2019s raised the stakes for Maryland, where the candidacy of the popular former governor is likely to make the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin more competitive than expected in a state that Joe Biden carried in 2020 by one of the largest margins in the country. \u201cA lot of people look at our state and say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s Maryland \u2014 it\u2019s a blue state, we can worry about another race someplace else,\u2019\u201d Alsobrooks said Tuesday night. \u201cYes, Maryland has been a blue state \u2014 but it will only stay a blue state if we put in the work.\u201d Even before the Democratic race was called, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee launched a new digital ad highlighting Hogan saying he\u2019s a \u201clifelong Republican\u201d and would caucus with the GOP if he gets to the Senate. National Republicans were quick to attack Alsobrooks\u2019 record while touting Hogan\u2019s eight-year tenure \u201creaching across the aisle.\u201d Alsobrooks is vying to be only the third Black woman elected to the Senate\u00a0\u2013 and the first Black\u00a0senator from Maryland.\u00a0(The one Black woman currently serving \u2014 California\u2019s Laphonza Butler \u2014 was appointed and\u00a0isn\u2019t running\u00a0to stay beyond this year.)\u00a0That history-making potential resonated with many of her supporters, who also wanted to see a woman in Maryland\u2019s 10-person congressional delegation, which is currently all male. \u201cTonight, we made history \u2014 and we did it while overcoming steep odds,\u201d Alsobrooks said Tuesday night. \u201cSo for anyone who\u2019s ever felt counted out, overlooked and underestimated \u2014 I hope you share in this moment and know what\u2019s possible.\u201d She thanked Trone, noting they\u2019d spoken earlier in the night. \u201cWe are united in our focus to keep the Senate blue, and I am grateful to have his support,\u201d Alsobrooks said. While Trone, the co-owner of Total Wine & More, had an enormous financial advantage \u2013 outspending Alsobrooks on the airwaves about $47.5 million to $4 million \u2013 she had powerful endorsements from Maryland\u2019s elected officials, including Gov. Wes Moore and every other member of the congressional delegation except for one House member and Cardin, who remained neutral. Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the second Black woman elected to the Senate, congratulated Alsobrooks for \u201cwinning a hard-fought, historic race\u201d in a statement on X, writing, \u201cI am confident that, come November, we will be calling her Senator Alsobrooks.\u201d After a contentious primary that turned negative in its final weeks, Maryland Democrats will need to unify against Hogan, who remains popular in the state after his pandemic leadership. \u201cBoth Angela Alsobrooks and David Trone ran strong campaigns that upheld Democratic values,\u201d Cardin said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cI am confident that Marylanders will come together now to protect women\u2019s rights, increase public safety, and maintain a Democratic majority that will hold the line against Republican extremists.\u201d Besides touting her record in Prince George\u2019s County, Alsobrooks\u00a0and her\u00a0allies pointed to\u00a0her\u00a0profile to\u00a0make the case that she was the better general election candidate.\u00a0She argued that she was a stronger messenger on abortion rights, for example, and frequently highlighted her opponent\u2019s\u00a0past\u00a0contributions to Republicans who have since signed abortion restrictions. (Trone has argued that those were business expenses\u00a0while touting\u00a0the millions he\u2019s donated to Democrats.) EMILY\u2019s List also made a $2.65 million investment\u00a0highlighting Trone\u2019s donations to Republicans on air. \u201cElecting women is not just good for Maryland,\u201d Alsobrooks told a crowd of supporters at a recent get-out-the-vote event in Silver Spring. \u201cIt\u2019s good for America to make sure that the voices of women are included at these tables as we\u2019re making important decisions.\u201d Trone had his own endorsements from House Democratic leadership and a string of congressional surrogates, including\u00a0California Rep. Adam Schiff, who joined him on the trail in the closing days of the race. He also touted the backing of some local leaders from Alsobrooks\u2019 backyard, specifically Black women, some of whom appeared in ads attacking the county executive. But some of Trone\u2019s comments during the primary\u00a0earned criticism from Black female leaders.\u00a0He\u00a0apologized for using a racial slur\u00a0during a congressional hearing, saying that he\u00a0had\u00a0misspoken. And even after his campaign edited out a comment from\u00a0an ad\u00a0in which a local politician suggested Alsobrooks would need \u201ctraining wheels\u201d in the Senate, Trone made a similar\u00a0remark\u00a0in an interview with a local NBC affiliate \u2013 later denying to CNN he had said those words. More than 750 Black female leaders condemned Trone\u2019s attack ads, calling out \u201ctones of misogyny and racism.\u201d They wrote in a letter: \u201cThis attempt to undermine Ms. Alsobrooks\u2019 candidacy is deeply troubling and emblematic of the obstacles Black women face in political spheres.\u201d Trone had made his ability to self-fund \u2013 and the independence he said that\u00a0gives\u00a0him from \u201cspecial interests\u201d \u2013 a crucial part of his electability pitch, with his closing ads laying out the threat Hogan\u00a0poses. He wasn\u2019t shy about arguing that he could take pressure off national Democrats to spend in normally deep-blue Maryland to focus on defending vulnerable incumbents around the country. But some voters said they were turned off by the amount of money he was spending, calling it \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201cshameful.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s so many White men who are millionaires who are in the Senate, and who are really out of touch with the issues that count, but she\u2019s really in touch and understands people\u2019s issues,\u201d 80-year-old Carolyn Long of Bethesda told CNN earlier this month. Alsobrooks raised nearly $7.8 million by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on April 24 and will likely have outside help in the general election against Hogan. \u201cEMILY\u2019s List is thrilled to stand with Alsobrooks in the general election to protect this vital Senate seat and make history by electing her to be Maryland\u2019s first Black Senator and only the fourth Black woman to serve in the chamber ever,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Jessica Mackler, said in a statement Tuesday night.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_west-virginia-senate-race", "text": "West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice won the state\u2019s Republican US Senate primary, positioning the two-term governor as the clear favorite to succeed\u00a0retiring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u00a0in the deep-red state. Justice triumphed in a crowded GOP primary that included US Rep. Alex Mooney, a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. He will face Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott, who had Manchin\u2019s endorsement and won the three-way Democratic primary. The West Virginia Senate seat\u00a0has long been seen as the most likely\u00a0to flip this cycle and will be key to GOP hopes of winning the Senate this November. Manchin\u2019s decision to retire was a harsh blow to Democrats\u2019 hopes of retaining their narrow majority\u00a0in the chamber. The party is also defending seats in two other GOP-leaning states, Montana and Ohio, as well\u00a0as in\u00a0swing\u00a0states such as\u00a0Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. National Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, largely coalesced in the West Virginia Republican primary around Justice, who was barred by term limits from seeking reelection as governor. Still, in the closing weeks, the Senate contest turned bitter as Justice and Mooney traded sharp jabs on air. Mooney launched blistering spots\u00a0accusing\u00a0Justice of supporting \u201cpro-transgender legislation\u201d and\u00a0claiming\u00a0that he \u201cpushed the biggest tax hike in West Virginia history.\u201d Meanwhile, Justice, the owner of the Greenbrier resort\u00a0who turned a coal mining business he inherited into a sprawling empire,\u00a0rebutted some of Mooney\u2019s criticism with\u00a0testimonials in his ads\u00a0from West Virginia coal miners.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_mike-johnson-donald-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is not waiting for ex-President Donald Trump to be judged by a jury of his peers. He\u2019s delivered his verdict already. The top Republican in the legislative branch showed up Tuesday at the courthouse where the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is on trial, deploying his authority and the symbolic weight of his office against the justice system. \u201cThe people are losing faith, right now, in this country, in our institutions,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said outside the building where Trump is facing accusations of falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payoff to a former adult film star before the 2016 election. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.) Johnson said Americans were \u201closing faith in our system of justice. And the reason for that is because they see it being abused as it is being done here in New York.\u201d As the trial reached its pivotal moment this week with the testimony of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen, Trump has been gathering high-profile Republicans at the courthouse \u2013 some of whom are auditioning for his vice-presidential spot. On Monday, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a possible VP contender, was there along with Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a famed former college football coach. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, also a possibility for the GOP ticket, showed up Tuesday and dismissed the proceedings as a \u201cpaperwork trial.\u201d It\u2019s a testimony to Trump\u2019s power in the party and command over its grassroots supporters that so many top GOP figures want to be seen supporting him despite his four criminal indictments. Even if this hush money case may be the weakest of them, and even if he\u2019s acquitted, it\u2019s resurfacing details of an alleged liaison with Stormy Daniels and airing testimony about his behavior that paints a grim character sketch. (Trump has denied the affair with Daniels.) These Republicans\u2019 desperation to move into the former president\u2019s inner circle is also ironic since Cohen has offered a cautionary tale in describing how he turned himself into a bullying, lying clone of Trump to grab a piece of his power and reflected glory. His efforts ended \u2013 as with many of Trump\u2019s associates \u2013 in shame and landed him on the wrong side of the law as he went to prison partly because of his role in the hush money cover-up. But Johnson is not just some rising GOP lawmaker \u2013 although he may owe Trump his job after fighting off an attempt to unseat him in which the ex-president declined to play a role. The speaker\u2019s appearance is different, given the constitutional heft of his office and the figurative connotations it evokes. \u201cThese are politically motivated trials, and they are a disgrace,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday. \u201cIt is election interference,\u201d he said, claiming the indictments show how \u201cdesperate\u201d Trump\u2019s opponents are, adopting the former president\u2019s campaign trope that he\u2019s a persecuted political victim. There are legitimate questions about this case \u2013 some of which were being teased out in court as Johnson spoke Tuesday \u2013 including whether the alleged offense arises to the level of a felony. Cohen, a convicted felon, is, to put it mildly, a problematic witness. Some experts have questioned whether any other defendant besides Trump would face the same indictment at the hands of a prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. The theory that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to a conspiracy to interfere in an election might be provable in court but may strike many voters as a stretch, especially during an election eight years later. And then there\u2019s the deeper question of prosecutorial discretion \u2013 whether the gravity of the alleged offenses is sufficient to take the unprecedented and politically radioactive step of putting a former president on trial as he seeks the office again. But Trump is hardly a victim. He is fully availing himself of the protections of the legal system he frequently lambasts. His appeals in other cases, for instance, mean this may be the only one of four trials he faces before the election. That means he\u2019s unlikely to face justice for seeking to overturn one election before standing in the next one. And his charges in this case were not just dreamed up \u2013 they emerged from a grand jury that decided there was a case to answer. Trump is exercising his right to mount a defense and is considered innocent until proven guilty. Johnson, however, claimed the trial was an attempt to destroy Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and prejudged the verdict in lashing out at a \u201csham\u201d trial. He attacked the judge and his partial gag order imposed on Trump to protect the safety of witnesses and sought to discredit the testimony of Cohen. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that he presents here that should be given any weight at all by a jury and certainly not this judge,\u201d Johnson said of the star witness. In seeking to discredit the case and a potential guilty verdict, Johnson is implicitly questioning whether courts should have the power to judge politicians \u2013 a position that, if adopted, would erode a legal system based on the principle that everyone, even ex-presidents, is equal under the law. Johnson\u2019s embrace of Trump is a sign that the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s transgressions \u2013 including his two impeachments, his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in office, his three other indictments, his vows to use a second term to weaponize presidential power against political enemies and to start mass deportations of undocumented migrants, as well as his embrace of rhetoric that echoes 1930s dictators \u2013 are no impediment to a party that craves a return to full power. And the speaker\u2019s willingness to put the symbolism of the legislative branch of government at the service of a strongman who again wants to head the executive branch shows there would be even fewer constitutional restraints on Trump than there were in his first term if Republicans triumph in November\u2019s election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/mike-johnson-donald-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

We all have bad weeks,\u201d Trump told radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton in an interview that aired Tuesday. \u201cCouple of rough stories, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d the former president said.\u00a0\u201cUntil this week, she was doing incredibly well. And she got hit hard and sometimes you do books and you have some guy writing a book and you maybe don\u2019t read it as carefully, you know. You have ghost writers do it, they help you, and they, in this case, didn\u2019t help too much.\u201d Noem became the subject of intense criticism for disclosing in her new book, \u201cNo Going Back: The Truth on What\u2019s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward\u201d that she shot and killed her dog, Cricket, because the puppy was \u201cuntrainable,\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cless than worthless \u2026 as a hunting dog.\u201d Noem also said in the book that President Joe Biden\u2019s dog Commander should suffer a similar fate to Cricket. Commander, Biden\u2019s German shepherd, has bitten Secret Service personnel in 24 separate incidents at the White House and other locations, according to CNN\u2019s reporting from February. The dog was\u00a0removed from the White House\u00a0in October. Controversy over the book also extended to other disclosures. For example, Noem falsely claimed that she once met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The book\u2019s publisher announced earlier this month that the relevant passage would be removed in reprints. CNN previously reported that Noem had already fallen off Trump\u2019s vice presidential candidate shortlist long before the latest controversy began. Still, Noem is slated to attend a Tuesday fundraiser for Trump in Manhattan, which will include others said to be under running mate consideration. Trump\u2019s praise also comes amid escalating tensions between Noem and tribal leaders in South Dakota over her previous remarks about Native American communities.

Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer Abbe Lowell argued the defense team would not be able to accomplish all that needs to be done in under three weeks. Lowell also pointed to the work needed to prepare for his client\u2019s other trial set for late June in California, where he is facing a federal tax indictment. \u201cIt cannot be done in two weeks, it just cannot,\u201d Lowell said, adding later, \u201cI am pleading with your honor\u201d to allow for more time. Lowell said he had not agreed to the June 3 date and thought it was only \u201cpenciled in.\u201d He suggested either an early September or even mid-July date to allow the defense more time to line up witnesses \u2014 who he said were difficult to find because people were \u201creluctant\u201d to be part of a public case in the current political environment. Noreika responded: \u201cYou said you were available in June.\u201d After Noreika made her decision not to delay the trial, Lowell asked for the deadlines for pretrial court filings to extended. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be your scheduling secretary,\u201d Noreika said, telling Lowell to work out new filing deadlines with the prosecution ahead of the trial date. Prosecutors claim Hunter Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which\u00a0violated federal law\u00a0because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts. Tuesday\u2019s decision from the judge came after Hunter Biden\u2019s latest attempts to throw out the case were rejected in back-to-back rulings last week from the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals and Noreika. Lowell said that he plans to ask the full 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider last week\u2019s decision \u2014 and that he\u2019ll seek an injunction to pause the trial until the appeals court rules. A panel of appellate judges in California also cleared the way Tuesday for Hunter Biden\u2019s separate tax-related trial to start in late June. Hunter Biden\u2019s efforts to appeal several decisions by the federal judge overseeing the tax case against him were rejected by a panel of 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals judges.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_desantis-bill-climate-change-florida", "text": "As Florida copes with rising seas and record temperatures, lawmakers are going to exceptional lengths to delete many mentions of climate change from state laws in a new bill that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Wednesday, according to his official X account. The wide-ranging law makes several changes to the state\u2019s energy policy \u2013 in some cases deleting entire sections of state law that talk about the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. The bill would also give preferential treatment to natural gas and ban offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida\u2019s coast. The bill deletes the phrase \u2018climate\u2019 eight times \u2013 often in reference to reducing the impacts of global climate change through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy \u2018climate friendly\u2019 products when they are cost-effective and available. The bill also gets rid of a requirement that state-purchased vehicles should be fuel efficient. \u201cFlorida rejects the designs of the left to weaken our energy grid, pursue a radical climate agenda, and promote foreign adversaries,\u201d DeSantis said in a post on X, posting a graphic that said the law would protect the state from \u201cgreen zealots.\u201d \u201cWhat Florida is really doing is saying we\u2019re going to deemphasize any policies that would help mitigate climate change,\u201d said Emily Hammond, a professor of law at George Washington University. It\u2019s certainly not the first time Republican politicians have deleted the phrase \u2018climate change\u2019 \u2013 erasing the phrase from government websites was a commonplace activity during the Trump administration. But experts said few other states have passed bills to move away from clean energy and erase climate mentions from their laws. \u201cIt goes further than any other state has gone in repealing its existing climate laws,\u201d Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told CNN. Last year was the hottest year on record for Florida, breaking yet another heat record in the state. South Florida in particular observed scorching heat index temperatures that reached as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Sea levels have risen as much as eight inches higher than they were in 1950, already leading to increased flooding from storms and tides alike. \u201cFlorida is one of the most vulnerable states in the country,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cAll of South Florida is at great peril from sea level rise. They should be the last state to stand in the way of fighting climate change.\u201d Even as Florida politicians are erasing mentions of climate change from their laws, they are also increasingly focused on helping a storm and flood-prone state withstand climate impacts. DeSantis and state lawmakers have poured over $1.1 billion into increasing community resilience to flooding and storms, according to a 2023 news release from the governor\u2019s office. In 2019, DeSantis appointed the state\u2019s first chief resilience officer Julia Nesheiwat \u2013 who explicitly referenced climate change and sea level rise as a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to the state. (Nesheiwat has since left her post and replaced by the state\u2019s current chief resilience officer Wesley Brooks). Florida has also accepted millions of dollars in federal funding to help reconstruct a state highway in Miami Beach \u2013 elevating the pavement and installing new pump stations to help clear the road of water during flooding events. When it comes to other federal climate and clean energy funding, however, the state hasn\u2019t been eager to accept. DeSantis vetoed over $29 million dollars in federal energy rebates and energy efficiency grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Florida was one of five states that declined to compete for $4.6 billion in federal climate grants, although numerous Florida metropolitan areas including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa have raised their hands for the funding instead. Hammond and Gerrard said this approach from Florida politicians to fund programs dealing with climate impacts without acknowledging its root cause isn\u2019t surprising. Hammond called focusing on adapting to climate change and hardening infrastructure without attribute it to a warming planet \u201cconsistent to the conservative approach.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t want to acknowledge that climate change is happening; they acknowledge they have flooding,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cIf it\u2019s about moving away from fossil fuels, they don\u2019t like it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/desantis-bill-climate-change-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_us-gaza-pier-moving-construction", "text": "The floating pier that will allow for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza from the sea is moving from the port of Ashdod toward Gaza, according to a US defense official. In addition, military ships that will construct the pier and secure it to the beach are also making their way to Gaza, the official said. Security concerns and sea conditions had delayed the movement of the pier for several days, but on Tuesday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said the pier should be operational \u201cin the coming days.\u201d The port of Ashdod is approximately 30 miles from the distribution site in Gaza where goods will be offloaded from the causeway, meaning the components of the system should be in position soon. The Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) system consists of two parts: the floating pier where shipments will be offloaded and the causeway to transfer the shipments to the distribution point in Gaza. On Wednesday, the UK announced that its first shipment of humanitarian aid, including 8,400 temporary shelters, is on its way from Cyprus to Gaza. Cyprus is the staging point for the humanitarian aid that will be shipped to Gaza through the maritime corridor and the pier. \u201cThe aid will be distributed within Gaza as soon as feasible,\u201d the UK said in its announcement. Meanwhile, US humanitarian aid is already positioned on a ship at the Ashdod port for offloading when the pier is ready, the Pentagon has said. The temporary pier is intended to supplement the aid going in through the land crossings into Gaza. The initial goal is to allow 90 truckloads of aid to enter Gaza each day through the pier, the UK said,\u00a0a number that could increase\u00a0to 150 truckloads per day when the pier is fully operational. Last week,\u00a0CNN reported that the US still faced a number of obstacles\u00a0before JLOTS could begin operations. The US was closely watching whether what it called a \u201climited\u201d Israeli incursion into Rafah in southern Gaza would affect the temporary pier. In addition, the US had not yet finalized plans about who would transport the humanitarian aid shipments from the causeway to the distribution point in Gaza. On Monday, the Pentagon said it had contracted drivers for the pier, though it declined to identify the drivers. \u201cI can just tell you it\u2019s a third-party contractor, but that\u2019s it,\u201d deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a press briefing. Once the humanitarian aid arrives in Gaza, the UN World Food Program will distribute it to the Palestinian population. On Tuesday, Ryder said security was in place to allow JLOTS operations to begin when the pier was ready. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll have the security in place that we need,\u201d Ryder said.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_house-passes-faa-reauthorization-bill", "text": "The House has passed a major federal aviation bill\u00a0that\u00a0aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The\u00a0bill\u00a0renewing the\u00a0Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s authority for five years will next head\u00a0to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The legislation passed the Senate last week. The House vote was\u00a0387 to 26. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA, as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Although the package has drawn broad bipartisan\u00a0support,\u00a0it touched off contentious debate over certain policy issues. One flashpoint centered on\u00a0a provision to add longer-distance\u00a0flights at Reagan National Airport, just outside of Washington, DC. A group of Washington-area Democratic senators\u00a0pressed to strip the provision from the package, though\u00a0the chamber didn\u2019t ultimately move to do so. Some lawmakers argue additional flights\u00a0would\u00a0give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport, as well as create safety issues. Lawmakers commute most weeks between their home states and Washington, and many could benefit from more convenient flights back and forth. Other key provisions of the legislation include: Hiring more air traffic controllers The bill would require the FAA to hire and train as many air traffic controllers as possible to close a gap of 3,000 vacancies. It would also mandate more research into how many controllers are needed at each tower and center and would increase access to training simulators in more air traffic control towers nationwide. Improving runway safety To reduce the number of collisions and near-collisions on runways, the FAA would be required to install additional runway technology at medium and large hub airports. The technology is only installed at about three dozen US airports, according to the FAA, and played a role in alerting controllers that American Airlines and Delta Air Lines\u00a0passenger jets were about to collide\u00a0on a John F. Kennedy airport runway in New York City in January 2023. Passenger protections In April, the Department of Transportation finalized a new rule on airline refunds: They\u2019re due in cash \u2013 rather than vouchers \u2013 within a few days, and come automatically. That means no requirement to call the airline and complain when your flight is canceled or substantially delayed. The compromise FAA bill as proposed originally did not go as far as the new DOT rule, which raised the possibility that a future DOT leadership could strip the automatic refund rule. After an outcry \u2013 including from an alliance of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 the bill\u2019s negotiators returned to the drawing board and added the automatic component into the bill. Under the new language, if a passenger declines an airline\u2019s rebooking request or does not respond to the request, the airline must issue an automatic refund. Enhancing protections for airline workers The legislation would put more teeth behind rules against attacks on aviation workers, which spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic, by expanding legal protections to ground-based employees like gate and check-in agents. It would also enhance Transportation Security Administration-taught\u00a0self-defense training\u00a0for flight attendants so they can better protect themselves and respond to unruly passengers and other threats. Setting a standard for travel credits Under the bill, travel credits issued by airlines in lieu of refunds would have to be useable for at least five years. Increasing cockpit voice recording Commercial aircraft would have to carry 25-hour cockpit voice recorders under the legislation. That was a top ask of the NTSB and a substantial increase from the current two-hour standard. The cockpit voice recorder is one of the two black boxes and is currently only required to capture two hours of sound from the cockpit. The NTSB says recordings that would be key to investigations have fallen outside the two-hour window and been overwritten.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/house-passes-faa-reauthorization-bill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_takeaways-maryland-west-virginia-nebraska-primaries", "text": "The matchups are set for two key races in this fall\u2019s battle for control of the narrowly divided Senate after Tuesday primaries in which two Republican governors \u2014 one former, one sitting \u2014 advanced, and a Democratic county executive beat a congressman who pumped tens of milions of his own dollars into his campaign. In Maryland, popular moderate former Gov. Larry Hogan won the Republican primary. Prince George\u2019s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks defeated Rep. David Trone, who loaned his campaign at least $62 million, in a hard-fought and expensive Democratic primary. And in West Virginia \u2014 where Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s retirement has handed Republicans a critical pick-up opportunity \u2014 Gov. Jim Justice easily won the GOP primary, setting the stage for a November matchup with the Democratic nominee, Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott, in which Justice will be heavily favored. Elliott is endorsed by Manchin, making the prospect of a late independent entry in a bid to keep his seat unlikely. Meanwhile, two moderate House Republicans fended off conservative challengers, and West Virginia Republicans chose their nominee to replace Justice in the governor\u2019s office. And while Tuesday\u2019s contests took place in states that aren\u2019t competitive in presidential elections \u2014 except Nebraska\u2019s 2nd congressional district, because the state awards its electoral college votes partially to the winners of each district \u2014 it offered a glimpse at a recurring theme: signs that some Republican voters are still voting against Trump. In deep-red Nebraska, with 38% of the expected vote counted, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had more than 20% of the vote. She was near 20% in Maryland, too, with 65% of the estimated vote counted. Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia: Trone\u2019s millions couldn\u2019t stop Alsobrooks in Maryland Trone\u2019s money bomb failed to detonate in Maryland on Tuesday, as the third-term House Democrat lost the party\u2019s Senate primary to Alsobrooks. Alsobrooks, who could become only the third Black woman elected to the US Senate and the first Black senator from Maryland, will face off with popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, in November for a seat that Democrats cannot afford to lose as they battle to keep control of the chamber. Trone not only spent tens of millions of his own cash, but pledged to do more of the same if he was nominated. Alas, he was not. Alsobrooks should not hurt for funds, though, with an array of outside groups poised to jump into the race for a seat Democrats have held since 1977, when Paul Sarbanes began his three-decade Senate career. But Hogan, who has occasionally been critical of former President Donald Trump, could complicate matters. Getting him into the race was seen as a coup for the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, and, at the very least, his name on the ballot means Democrats will have to invest considerable sums in the race. Justice positioned to flip Manchin\u2019s Senate seat in West Virginia Republicans are well-positioned to flip party control of the West Virginia Senate seat held by retiring Democrat Joe Manchin. Justice, a two-term governor, coasted to victory in Tuesday\u2019s GOP primary against a field that included US Rep. Alex Mooney, a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. He\u2019ll face Elliott, the winner of a three-way Democratic primary, in November.\u00a0While Manchin reportedly may have considered an independent bid had former coal executive Don Blankenship won the Democratic primary, that idea is all but gone with his endorsed candidate moving on to November. Justice, the 73-year-old owner of the Greenbrier resort who turned a coal mining business he inherited into a sprawling empire, was elected governor in 2016 as a Democrat but switched his party affiliation early in his first term \u2014 a move he announced at an August 2017 rally with Trump. Though Justice won as a Democrat in 2016 and Manchin was reelected in 2018, West Virginia is now a heavily Republican state \u2014 Trump took more than 68% of the vote there in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, and Manchin is the lone remaining Democrat to hold nonjudicial statewide office. AIPAC gets a big win in deep blue Maryland Maryland state Sen. Sarah Elfreth didn\u2019t enjoy much name recognition outside the district she is now poised to represent in Congress next year, but that low national profile might have helped her chances in deep blue suburban Baltimore. Elfreth emerged from a field of more than 20 primary candidates by stressing her local connections and, as the campaign got tight, her top rival\u2019s lack thereof.\u00a0Former police officer Harry Dunn, who defended the US Capitol against pro-Trump insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, was the preferred candidate of several Democratic bigwigs, but Elfreth \u2013 with a major boost from\u00a0the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s super PAC, United Democracy Project \u2013\u00a0comfortably won the nomination. In addition to UDP, which spent $3.6 million on advertising alone,\u00a0Elfreth also had strong support from organized labor, including the powerful Maryland State Education Association,\u00a0and from retiring Sen. Ben\u00a0Cardin, former Sen. Barbara Mikulski and an impressive slate of state and local lawmakers. What\u2019s less clear is why AIPAC decided to spend so big in the district, especially since there wasn\u2019t much daylight between Elfreth and Dunn, who was widely regarded as her top rival. The impetus might have been the candidacy of labor lawyer John Morse, who was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but Morse was long since left behind by the frontrunners. Moderate House GOP incumbents survive It was a good night for the more moderate House Republican incumbents. In Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District, a competitive Omaha-based district, Rep. Don Bacon defeated conservative challenger Dan Frei, who was endorsed by Rep. Bob Good, the chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. Bacon is now headed for a rematch with Democratic state lawmaker Tony Vargas in November. US Rep. Carol Miller, a member of the center-right Main Street Caucus, fended off a challenge from Derrick Evans, a former state lawmaker who served three months in prison after filming himself behind police lines and in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Morrisey wins nasty West Virginia gubernatorial primary With Justice term-limited out of the office, the GOP primary drew a host of well-connected Republicans vying to replace him in the governor\u2019s mansion. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey won a race that also featured Moore Capito, the son of Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito; Secretary of State Mac Warner; and Chris Miller, the son of Carol Miller, the congresswoman. The primary was a nasty one. It featured a political action committee supporting Morrisey airing television spots taking aim at transgender people and describing Miller and Capito as allies of LGBT people. A pro-Capito group similarly aired ads comparing Morrisey to a pig and criticizing \u201cthe woke sex change industry.\u201d Morrisey will face Democratic Huntington Mayor Steve Williams in the general election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/takeaways-maryland-west-virginia-nebraska-primaries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "It would be no surprise if the jury in Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial now sees his former fixer, Michael Cohen, as a profane social media troll and vengeful liar who dreams of seeing the boss he once worshipped behind bars. But jurors don\u2019t have to like Cohen. They just have to believe him. Trump\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d came under a sustained attack from defense attorney Todd Blanche Tuesday in a cross-examination meant to shatter his credibility as the star witness to the ex-president\u2019s allegedly criminal behavior. But critically, he didn\u2019t lose his composure on the stand. So far, he\u2019s avoided traps that would fatally undermine the case. Cohen will get time to take stock on Wednesday, on the trial\u2019s regular day off, which will also give Trump\u2019s team a chance to sharpen its approach. The presumptive GOP nominee, meanwhile, is due to take the opportunity to launch a fundraising swing through Ohio and Kentucky before court resumes Thursday. Cohen has already directly implicated Trump in making payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover-up their alleged affair and apparently corroborated prosecution evidence that the scheme was meant to influence the 2016 election. (Trump has denied an affair and pleaded not guilty). The task of the defense in cross-examination was, therefore, to so undermine Cohen\u2019s credibility that they sowed reasonable doubt in the minds of at least one juror about the wider case. Blanche took Cohen through a long list of the insults he\u2019s unleashed at Trump since becoming estranged from his former mentor, highlighting his penchant for serial lying. He drew jurors\u2019 attention to a social media post in which Cohen wore a T-shirt that depicted Trump in jail, as he spun a narrative of bias and obsession. Blanche also got the witness to say that he\u2019d built up a lucrative business, especially in books focused on his criticism of the former president. He asked if Cohen had called Trump a \u201cboorish cartoon misogynist.\u201d Cohen replied, \u201cSounds like something I would say.\u201d Then Trump\u2019s attorney inquired if he\u2019d mocked the ex-president as a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d Blanche also sought to draw out Cohen\u2019s grudge against Trump, which he can later highlight to the jury in closing arguments, by asking him about a TikTok post in April in which he said Trump belonged in a \u201cf**king cage like an animal\u201d and asked him to confirm that he\u2019d also called the presumptive GOP nominee a \u201cdictator douchebag.\u201d Michael Moore, a former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that the defense had made some progress in impeaching Cohen\u2019s credibility. \u201cI really took away that the jury is probably seeing and thinking right now that Cohen is a grifter and a waffler,\u201d said Moore, a CNN legal analyst. \u201cHe clearly is making money off this, he clearly is somebody who has got his hand in the till to sell his books.\u201d Big questions in the trial coming into focus But notably, Blanche mostly concentrated on his effort to tarnish Cohen\u2019s character, motives and credibility rather than the core question of the case \u2014 whether Trump falsified the business records as part of a cover up expressly designed to mislead voters in 2016 in an early instance of election interference. As always, when a Trump subordinate performs in front of the boss, there was a sense Blanche\u2019s histrionics were as much for the benefit of his client as the case. And in a curious debut of the cross-examination, Blanche earned an admonition from Judge Juan Merchan for making it all about him, when he noted Cohen had called him a \u201ccrying little sh*t\u201d on TikTok. Questions hanging over the case with the court dark on Wednesday start with how badly Blanche managed to damage Cohen\u2019s testimony and the prosecution case with his full-frontal assault. Given that the prosecution has already signaled it plans no further witnesses after Cohen\u2019s testimony, attention is turning to the approach the defense will take. Will Trump\u2019s lawyers bring in a number of witnesses? Or could they adopt a bold gambit by simply arguing that the prosecution has fallen woefully short of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt and dramatically rest? Then there is Trump\u2019s initial indication that he\u2019d like to testify in his own defense. The former president loves a stage and considers himself his best advocate \u2014 even if history often suggests the opposite. But many lawyers believe that given his volatile temperament and trouble telling the truth, putting him on the stand would represent a potential disaster for the defense. A key legal conundrum is whether prosecutors have so far succeeded in validating the legal theory behind the case. \u201cI think the misdemeanor of falsification of business records has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt,\u201d Shira Scheindlin, a retired US district court judge, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \u201cThe felony is a little tougher because you have to say that Trump knowingly and willfully intended to violate the election law in the state of New York by unlawful means and the unlawful means is to violate the federal campaign finance law.\u201d Scheindlin added: \u201cCohen went a long way toward making that case.\u201d As the prosecution case nears its end, there is also a growing sense that the fateful moment when Trump must wait for a jury to decide whether he will become the first president convicted of a crime is approaching. That foreboding realization was exacerbated by a new posse of Trump supporters at the courthouse on Tuesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. The Louisiana Republican brought the full symbolic heft of his office to bear in an apparent attempt to delegitimize the trial, to bolster Trump\u2019s claim that he\u2019s a victim of weaponized justice and to potentially hedge against a potential conviction with an early round of political spin. \u201cThese are politically motivated trials, and they are a disgrace,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday outside the courthouse. \u201cIt is election interference,\u201d he said. Defense tactics raise eyebrows It\u2019s impossible to know how a jury interprets testimony until a verdict is delivered \u2014 and even then, jurors often opt not to explain their verdicts in detail in media interviews in high-profile cases like this one. Some legal experts on Tuesday questioned the tone and tactics adopted by Blanche in the court. While Cohen\u2019s reluctance to offer yes-and-no answers came across at times as flippant and confrontational, he did not appear to say or do anything to torpedo the prosecution case. He did not blow up at Blanche, despite the attorney\u2019s incessant goading and an attempt to put him off his game by erratically jumping from topic to topic. \u201cNo massive disasters yet,\u201d former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN. But Moore, the CNN legal analyst, defended Blanche\u2019s approach of mixing up the evidential timeline to try to shake Cohen\u2019s pre-trial prep. \u201cYou want to make them tell the story on your terms and not to follow the script,\u201d Moore said. The prosecution knew that Blanche\u2019s attack was coming and worked all morning on Tuesday to nail down a narrative about the payment to Daniels and its purpose. Manhattan prosecutor Susan Hoffinger tried to undermine a defense claim that Trump\u2019s reimbursements to Cohen were part of a retainer for legal services and not to pay him back for the Daniels hush money payment. In a key moment in the trial, which resonated outside the courtroom given the obligations that Trump places on many of his aides and subordinates, Cohen described the moment when he broke from his former boss. \u201cMy family, my wife, my daughter, my son all said to me, \u2018Why are you holding onto this loyalty, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d Cohen said, adding that he came to a point when it was time to listen. \u201cI would not lie for President Trump any longer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-conservatives-pornography-fight", "text": "For the past several weeks, witnesses in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial have\u00a0evoked a chapter of his past\u00a0when the adult entertainment industry helped\u00a0him\u00a0brandish an image as a Manhattan playboy. If some of the former president\u2019s allies get their way, a second Trump term would put that industry on the ropes\u00a0\u2013 and potentially its actors and producers behind bars. A movement to\u00a0rein\u00a0in online pornography is rapidly intensifying, fueled by conservative\u00a0outrage\u00a0and growing unease over the accessibility of sexual content online, especially for children. In dozens of states, the porn industry is on the defense and facing new threats to its existence after decades of expansion in the internet era. Now, those\u00a0cheering on\u00a0the effort are preparing to take\u00a0the\u00a0push national,\u00a0putting porn producers as well as teachers, librarians and tech companies on notice \u2013\u00a0and they increasingly view Trump as a potential linchpin in the coming fight. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good opportunity for President Trump to continue to build on his legacy of being supportive of working families and children,\u201d said Terry Schilling, the president of American Principles Project, one of the driving forces behind the new state laws. The cause has support within some of the highest reaches of Trump\u2019s orbit, including the Heritage Foundation, a Washington, DC-based conservative think tank that is already laying the groundwork for the Republican\u2019s potential return to the White House. Through its Project 2025 initiative, the organization published a 900-page blueprint for\u00a0another\u00a0Trump\u00a0term. Pornography is mentioned on the first page; banning pornography and locking up those who produce it are proposed on Page 5. At first glance, Trump appears an unlikely champion for cracking down on the adult entertainment industry. Long before launching a political career, Trump developed a history with Playboy, the men\u2019s magazine that helped mainstream pornography and pioneered its place in the lawfare over free speech. He was an occasional guest at Hugh Hefner\u2019s famed Playboy Mansion and made cameos in soft-core pornographic films produced by the company \u2013 though not in any scenes depicting sexual content or nudity. During his 2016 race, he proudly displayed an issue of Playboy magazine that featured him on the cover. Allegations stemming from\u00a0that period \u2013\u00a0including affairs with\u00a0porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal \u2013 sit at the heart of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case against Trump, the first criminal prosecution of an American president. McDougal has previously claimed she met Trump at the Playboy Mansion, an encounter\u00a0she said\u00a0led to an eight-month affair. In testimony last week, Daniels said her\u00a02006\u00a0tryst with Trump\u00a0occurred at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe\u00a0where her adult film company sponsored a hole. Trump has denied the allegations. Heritage President Kevin Roberts\u00a0is unconcerned by Trump\u2019s past. He\u00a0likened\u00a0it to the parable of the prodigal son, a New Testament teaching about paternal forgiveness granted to a man who squanders his father\u2019s fortune with indulgences. \u201cWe understand our\u00a0lord works with imperfect instruments, including us,\u201d Roberts said in a recent interview with CNN. \u201cWhile on the surface it seems like a contradiction, on the whole, it may make him a more powerful messenger if he embraces it.\u201d Roberts hasn\u2019t discussed the topic directly with Trump, but he has talked to the campaign and said there is alignment among those who have policy influence, including Ben Carson, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Charlie Kirk, the founder of the conservative young voter group Turning Points USA and a close Trump ally, has also made curbing pornography a recurring focus of his popular podcast. \u201cWithout being presumptuous of the president\u2019s will, there will at least be conversations on this being a priority we can tackle,\u201d Roberts said. Asked about the focus on pornography by Project 2025 and other closely aligned groups, Trump\u2019s campaign pointed to a past statement from its top advisers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, downplaying any connection between those organizations and the former president\u2019s plans for a second term. \u201cLet us be very specific here: unless a message is coming directly from President Trump or an authorized member of his campaign team, no aspect of future presidential staffing or policy announcements should be deemed official,\u201d the statement from LaCivita and Wiles said. \u2018Sex is the canary in the coal mine\u2019 The Supreme Court has deemed previous attempts to\u00a0curb online pornography\u00a0unconstitutional\u00a0on First Amendment grounds. But Schilling\u2019s group and others have successfully pushed a growing number of states to test the legal system once again. In the past two years, 10 states have moved to force adult websites to verify the age of their users \u2013 often with bipartisan support \u2013 and legislatures in two dozen others are considering nearly identical legislation, according to a bill tracker maintained by the Free Speech Coalition, the advocacy group for the online pornography industry. In some states, porn websites cannot be accessed without showing identification confirming the user is over 18 years of age. Supporters of these laws argue the tools for restricting websites have become more sophisticated in the two decades since the Supreme Court struck down Congress\u2019 first stab at requiring age checks.\u00a0They point to industries such as online gambling and mobile alcohol sales that have successfully integrated age verifications. Meanwhile, the availability of the internet has made it much easier for sexual content to reach kids in a way that necessitates legislative action, they say. The porn industry and free speech advocates contend these laws violate the First Amendment rights of consenting adults to produce and view sexual content. Requiring a government-issued ID to watch pornography is akin to having Big Brother peer into the most intimate quarters of Americans\u2019 personal lives, they argue. The US Supreme Court last month declined to block the Texas version of the law from taking effect while an appeal is considered. \u201cSex is the canary in the coal mine of free speech,\u201d said Mike Stabile, spokesman for the Free Speech Coalition. \u201cIt may sound good to create age-verification laws, but what these people are really trying to do is create a larger censorship regime so that you have to show who you are to access sensitive content.\u201d Pornhub, one of the most trafficked websites in the world, and its sister sites have blocked access in seven states \u2013 Virginia, Montana, North Carolina, Arkansas, Utah, Mississippi and Texas \u2013 as a means to comply with new laws. The adult industry insists it doesn\u2019t want children accessing its material but says the onus should be on Apple, Google and other device makers to sell phones and tablets with default settings that ensure kids can\u2019t access adult content, an alternative that technology companies oppose. \u201cParents, not the government, are best positioned to make these judgments based on their own family\u2019s unique needs and values,\u201d said Robert Winterton, spokesman for NetChoice, an organization that represents tech companies including Amazon, X and Facebook. \u201cOne-size-fits-all mandates are unlikely to be effective and risk undermining the constitutional and parental authority.\u201d Purveyors of online pornography have long assumed the recent wave of age-restriction laws is a means to put them out of business. In Louisiana, the first state to pass such laws, Pornhub saw an 80% decline in traffic, executives for the company told CNN, citing Google Analytics data. Heritage\u2019s Project 2025 has given credence to their concerns. It likens pornography to illicit drugs in declaring the content \u201cshould be outlawed\u201d and \u201cthe people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned.\u201d Teachers and librarians\u00a0who\u00a0distribute content Heritage deems pornographic \u201cshould be classified as registered sex offenders,\u201d the document continues, and tech companies that facilitate its spread \u201cshould be shuttered.\u201d \u201cWe see pornography as undermining the public good, not just for children but all adults,\u201d Roberts told CNN. \u201cWe think that\u2019s in the purview of Congress.\u201d The National Center on Sexual Exploitation \u2013 a leading advocate against pornography that for most of its existence went by the name \u201cMorality in Media\u201d and has worked closely on these state laws \u2013 has also publicly stated its goal is \u201cto ensure the online pornography industry is taken down once and for all.\u201d \u201cThese laws don\u2019t work because they weren\u2019t designed to work,\u201d said Solomon Friedman, a lawyer and co-founding partner of Ethical Capital Partners, the Canadian firm that purchased\u00a0Pornhub last year. \u201cThey weren\u2019t designed to protect young people from accessing adult content. They were designed to protect adults from accessing adult content, which, of course, is their stated aim. It\u2019s not a conspiracy theory when it\u2019s written on Page 1.\u201d Schilling disputed that his organization is working toward a federal prohibition on porn, telling CNN:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been tough enough getting legislators on board\u00a0 with age verification.\u201d \u201cPolitics and public policy have to be based in political reality,\u201d he said. Given Heritage\u2019s influence \u2013 the organization is full of the former president\u2019s staff, and the person leading Project 2025, Paul Dans, is a former Trump administration official who told a recent gathering of religious broadcasters that he expects to return to the White House if Republicans are victorious this fall \u2013 they are not dismissing the threat, Stabile said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it deathly seriously,\u201d Stabile said. \u201cNot just for us, but for all kinds of communities around sex or gender. This isn\u2019t a joke to us. This isn\u2019t theoretical.\u201d Next steps Schilling and others want a Trump administration to more aggressively use the US Department of Justice to utilize existing laws to target content they view as obscene. They have also proposed a federal version of age-verification legislation that has successfully passed in states. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta go national,\u201d Schilling said. \u201cWhy should kids from California not be protected from pornography online?\u201d Any law signed by Trump would run into the same constitutional objections raised by the US Supreme Court in the past, said Stuart Brotman, a media professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Proponents hope the court, which skews conservative and includes three Trump appointees, will take a different view. Brotman \u2013 who has written extensively on pornography and free speech, including a book on Playboy\u2019s Hefner \u2013 is skeptical. \u201cThe Roberts court has been considered a highly First Amendment-friendly court,\u201d Brotman said. \u201cIt would be difficult for some of the justices now to indicate there\u2019s a more narrow view of the First amendment.\u201d If Trump chooses to embrace this cause, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. The GOP platform when he was first nominated in 2016 said pornography was \u201cdestroying the lives of millions.\u201d That same year, Trump signed a pledge that he would consider a presidential commission to examine the \u201cpublic health impact of Internet pornography on youth, families and the American culture.\u201d Advocates were ultimately let down by his administration, said Ben Bull, general counsel for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s political expediency or if it\u2019s heartfelt this time,\u201d Bull said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. But people are only going to be fooled for so long.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-conservatives-pornography-fight/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing more critical moments this week that will test his fraught relationship with his base over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and potentially widen the partisan split about the Jewish state that has been building for years. Long before the current conflict, polls showed that sympathies among rank-and-file Democrats have been shifting from Israel toward the Palestinians over roughly the past two decades\u00a0\u2014 a period that coincides with almost unbroken right-leaning governments in Israel, mostly led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Simultaneously, support for Israel over that same long period has markedly increased among rank-and-file Republican voters. As a result, over twice as many Republican as Democratic voters now say they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, a much bigger gap between the parties than earlier in this century, according to Gallup Organization polling. This widening partisan chasm in the United States suggests that whenever Netanyahu leaves the political stage in Israel, an inescapable part of his legacy will be a leading role in shattering the bipartisan consensus that for decades provided Israel an almost unassailable position in US politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the drivers of the US-Israeli relationship that have accounted for its resilience, its special quality and character over the years, are more under stress than at any point in my government experience or even out of government,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has advised six secretaries of state on the Mideast. That rising pressure could make Biden the last of his kind: Though the vast majority of Democratic office-holders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. He\u2019s expected to make a speech on antisemitism on Tuesday at an event sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Meanwhile, Democratic critics of his handling of the war will be watching on Wednesday when his administration is due to report to Congress on whether Israel is using US weapons in accordance with international law and is cooperating with the delivery of humanitarian aid. Biden\u2019s deep personal bond with Israel already makes him a throwback in US politics. In the first half century after Israel\u2019s formation in 1948, it was Democratic presidents such as Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton who displayed the greatest emotional connection to the Jewish state. Republican presidents including Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also supported Israel but more overtly qualified that support when it conflicted with their other regional goals of preserving access to oil and repelling Soviet influence; Reagan and Bush each at points protested Israeli actions they opposed by temporarily withholding aid. Over roughly the past quarter century this partisan pattern has inverted. Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump have identified most thoroughly with Israel, while Clinton (in his second term) and Barack Obama experienced the most disagreements with the Israeli government. Many factors have contributed to this reversal of roles. Bush\u2019s campaign against Islamic extremism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks encouraged him to place more value on Israel as a regional ally. Growing identification with Israel among US White evangelical Christians, a key GOP constituency, also nudged the party toward greater support for the Jewish state. Conversely, more voters in the Democratic coalition (both racial minorities and liberal Whites) came to see Israel\u2019s treatment of the occupied Palestinian territories as colonial, or even apartheid-type, oppression. While holding the prime minister position in the late 1990s and then again with only brief interruption since 2009, Netanyahu has also played a huge personal role in prompting this American partisan reversal. Netanyahu has pursued staunchly conservative policies within Israel (such as his attempt to weaken the judiciary that triggered massive nationwide protest) and rebuffed pressure from successive Democratic presidents to negotiate an independent Palestinian state. As important, he has aligned with the Republican Party as overtly as any foreign leader has with either political party in modern times. Netanyahu in 2015, for instance, delivered a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal at the invitation of House Republicans \u2014 over express objections from Obama. And Netanyahu recently echoed Republican talking points at a news conference when he dismissed the protests about the war on US campuses as simply widespread antisemitism. Against this backdrop, partisan polarization about Israel among American voters was already widening years before the brutal Hamas attack last October and the devastating Israeli response it triggered. One measure is the annual Gallup polls that ask Americans whether they sympathize mostly with Israel or mostly with the Palestinians. In 2001, the share of Republican voters who said they sympathized mostly with Israel exceeded the share of Democrats by only eight percentage points (59% vs. 51%.) By Obama\u2019s second term, Republican partisans were over 20 points more likely than Democrats to say they sympathized mostly with Israel. The gap between the parties in sympathy for Israel expanded under Trump to nearly 40 points, and it has soared to 45 points under Biden \u2014 nearly six times the difference in 2001. In the 2023 and 2024 surveys, Gallup recorded for the first time that the share of Democrats who sympathized mostly with the Palestinians exceeded the share who mostly favored Israel. Another long-running survey series from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found similar, though not quite as extensive, movement. In 2002, the share of Republicans who said the US should take Israel\u2019s side in the conflict was roughly double the percentage of Democrats; in the latest survey, \u00a0conducted this February, the gap had grown to about 3-to-1. The survey found that the share of Democrats who said the US should align with Israel in the conflict, after falling through the Trump years, rebounded to nearly 1-in-5 in the latest poll, almost exactly its level in the early 2000s. But as many Democrats now say the US should side with the Palestinians \u2013 a view held by just 1-in-50 Democrats in 2002. (That\u2019s also the same share of Republicans today\u00a0 who say the US should side with the Palestinians.) Most Democrats said the US should not take either side in the conflict \u2014 a view shared by only about two-fifths of Republicans. An array of polls this spring show how the war in Gaza has hardened this partisan split. \u00a0Earlier this year, both Quinnipiac University and CBS/YouGov polls found that while about 55% of Republicans wanted the US to send more military aid to Israel, about two-thirds of Democrats did not. Nearly half of Democrats, but only a little over one-fifth of Republicans in the CBS poll, said the US should pressure Israel to stop the fighting. While a slim majority of Republicans expressed confidence in Netanyahu in an April Pew survey, over 7-in-10 Democrats said they had little or no faith in the Israeli leader \u201dto do the right thing.\u201d In the Quinnipiac survey just 5% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu; the number was 11 times as high among Republicans. All of the dividing lines separating the parties are also cleaving the generations. Just 1-in-12 young adults in the Quinnipiac poll said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu and over two-thirds opposed sending more arms to Israel; likewise, in the Pew survey about two-thirds of young adults said they viewed the Israeli government unfavorably. Gallup\u2019s latest poll found that while older adults still mostly favor Israel, a plurality of younger adults now express sympathy for the Palestinians. These shifts in attitudes within the Democratic coalition have only modestly changed behavior among the party\u2019s leading elected officials. Only 37 House Democrats ultimately voted against the recently approved foreign aid package that included over $26 billion in new military assistance to Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite an earlier speech criticizing Netanyahu, is reportedly joining with House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint congressional session \u2014 an extraordinary opportunity given how many of Biden\u2019s requests Netanyahu has resisted since the war began. Liberal critics of Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians, both before and after the October 7 attacks, largely attribute the widening disconnect between Democratic voters and elected officials to the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other pro-Israeli lobbying groups in Washington. Since the Obama presidency, AIPAC has become more aggressive in supporting primary campaigns against Democratic officials critical of Israel; it has pledged to spend $100 million this year to defeat members of Congress who have criticized Israel\u2019s conduct of the war most strongly such as Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. \u201cAIPAC\u2019s enormous financial and political pressure in Washington is the most important factor in slowing down larger numbers of Democratic officials from opposing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, who has held senior positions in multiple liberal organizations and has been active in organizing opposition to the war. \u201cBy targeting Democrats who oppose a blank check of weapons funding to Israel, AIPAC aims to stall an inevitable generational shift within the party.\u201d Yet AIPAC\u2019s influence alone doesn\u2019t explain the distance opening between Democratic voters and officials. Part of the answer, as Shahid suggests, is generational. Biden personifies an older cohort of US political leaders whose image of Israel was formed when it was a lonely outpost of democracy and haven for Holocaust survivors. Ordinary Americans and US political leaders alike in the years of the 1967 and Yom Kippur (1973) wars tended to view Israel, in Miller\u2019s words, as a David barely fending off threatening Goliaths; now, many younger Democrats in particular believe \u201cIsrael is no longer David, it\u2019s Goliath,\u201d and it \u201cis pounding David\u201d in Gaza, Miller said. Older Democratic officials have been less influenced than younger ones by the emergence of that new perspective among their voters. Many observers also note that Biden tends to view foreign policy much as he does domestic politics \u2014 placing enormous confidence in his ability to leverage personal relationships with other leaders. \u201cBiden always says \u2018all foreign policy is an extension of personal relationships,\u2019\u201d said Ben Rhodes, who served as a senior National Security Council adviser while Biden served as Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I heard him say that.\u201d Biden over the course of the war has more explicitly criticized Netanyahu and the far-right coalition that he is governing with, but he has still rebuffed rising demands within Democratic ranks to penalize Israel for its conduct of the war and resistance to the delivery of humanitarian aid. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the seventh month of this war, and this administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on this Israeli government that normal humans would regard as serious or significant pressure,\u201d said Miller. Instead, Miller added, Biden is still operating primarily from the belief that to achieve his goals in the region \u2014 more humanitarian aid into Gaza, a ceasefire that leads to further hostage releases and eventually a regional accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201che cannot do that by creating a sustained public breach with the Israeli prime minister. He needs Israel\u2019s acquiescence if not its active assistance.\u201d Biden allies also believe Israel\u2019s critics within the party are overstating the political risks of his continued support. Though polls show widespread opposition to the war among both young people and Democrats more broadly, they also usually show that those voters prioritize other issues more. \u201cWhile some elements of the party\u2019s activist core are focused on what\u2019s happening in Gaza, most Democrats and most Americans are not,\u201d said long-time Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a pro-Israeli group. \u201cRather they are seized with other issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s holding down prices or protecting abortion rights or protecting democracy itself. \u201c But as the war persists \u2014 with the wave of campus protests compounding the fractures over the issue in the Democratic coalition \u2014 there are clear signs the party\u2019s center of gravity is moving away from the instinctive support for Israel expressed by older Democrats such as Biden and Schumer. The telltale sign is not the escalating outrage over the war from liberals long critical of Netanyahu and far-right Israeli governments, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House. Rather the key measure is the willingness of ambitious mid-career Democrats closer to the party center to criticize Israel\u2019s conduct of the war more openly and to indicate support for limiting the future transfer of offensive weapons; the list of Democrats in that camp include Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Biden only agreed to deliver the report due Wednesday on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and cooperation with international aid after pressure from a group of about 20 Democratic senators led by Van Hollen. Though almost all Democratic senators voted for the recent military aid package for Israel, Biden risks alienating many who supported the assistance if Wednesday\u2019s report to Congress does not seriously address whether Israel should be penalized for its actions in the war, said Amanda Klasing, the national director of government relations and advocacy for Amnesty International. Amnesty recently issued a report charging that Israel has targeted civilians with US weapons in violation of international law. \u201cBiden has a Democratic caucus that is putting a lot of faith in this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have taken these votes under the assumption that these conditions will be applied by the administration.\u201d The Israeli prime minister\u2019s personal relationship with Trump is prickly, but Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach toward both the Palestinians and Iran has encouraged the GOP\u2019s transformation into what Miller calls \u201cthe Israel can do no wrong party.\u201d If Israel elects a more centrist government in the future, Miller believes, the widening US partisan divide over Israel could narrow. But given the alienation about Israeli actions among Democratic partisans in general \u2014 and younger voters in particular \u2014 it seems virtually guaranteed that Democratic elected officials in the years ahead will face greater pressure than Republicans to maintain a critical distance from Israel. So far, Biden has been much more inclined to resist than respond to that pressure. A ceasefire could diffuse that pressure for a time. But even Biden may not be able to ignore the inevitable backlash among Democrats if Netanyahu, with or without a cease fire, eventually fulfills his pledge to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. The fierce Israeli response to the terrorist attacks of October 7 may leave in rubble not just much of Gaza, but the US tradition of bipartisan support for Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_politics_georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election", "text": "Rebel Teahouse is Christine Nguyen\u2019s business. And her happy place. Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_nikki-haley-donor-retreat", "text": "More than two months after ending her presidential bid, Nikki Haley did not directly address the topic of Donald Trump\u00a0or her political future\u00a0during a two-day gathering of some of her key donors in Charleston, South Carolina,\u00a0this week.\u00a0Instead,\u00a0the former South Carolina governor\u00a0and her top political aides\u00a0answered\u00a0questions\u00a0about policy\u00a0from those donors and ran through the numbers of how her now-suspended 2024\u00a0campaign raised and spent its money. Since leaving the race, she has kept a relatively low profile, conspicuously refraining from endorsing Trump or encouraging her Republican supporters \u2013 who continue to show up to the primary polls, even with the former president set to win the nomination \u2013\u00a0to oppose him. The donor retreat was one of the biggest signals Haley has given since dropping out of the race that she hopes to keep some presence in national politics.\u00a0The former governor, according to multiple attendees, opted against weighing in on any of the larger questions concerning what comes next for her,\u00a0but she did discuss policy related questions and thank some of her top donors for fueling her campaign. The\u00a0retreat was described as similar to an \u201cinvestor conference,\u201d according to one attendee.\u00a0Haley did not say at any point whether she would endorse Trump, be willing to run as Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee if offered, or run for president in the future, according to multiple attendees of the donor retreat. But those attendees came away from the event with the impression that Haley herself did not have a firm answer to any of those questions. The discussion also veered at one point to Haley backers who are still voting for her in\u00a0the primary even though she\u2019s dropped out of the race.\u00a0On Tuesday night, for example, during the second day of the donor retreat, Trump won the Maryland Republican primary with 80% of the vote;\u00a0 almost 20% of GOP voters chose Haley. Haley didn\u2019t directly say whether she wanted her backers to keep voting for her or to just vote for Trump. She\u2019s deliberately not saying that, one attendee said, but she indicated that she wanted her supporters and attendees at the retreat to \u201cvote your conscience, vote however you want to vote.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s for you to decide,\u201d Haley said, according to one attendee. During the event,\u00a0 Haley did not directly address\u00a0her ongoing support in the primary\u00a0or offer any direct plans about her political future or running again, according to Eric J. Tanenblatt, a top donor who attended the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s made any decisions about her future,\u201d Tanenblatt said. Also during the retreat, longtime Haley adviser Jon Lerner and Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney gave a presentation about how the campaign raised and spent money while the former governor and UN ambassador was running. \u201c[Ankney and Lerner] walked through how the money was spent and how they did what they did. There was obviously a lot of talk about what people would\u00a0like\u00a0her to do. But again she hasn\u2019t made any decisions. I think it\u2019s fair to say, though, that she\u2019s 52 years old, so she\u2019s got some years ahead of her,\u201d Tanenblatt said. Haley also fielded questions from donors on specific issues, including\u00a0abortion, the state of American democracy and the national debt, according to multiple attendees.\u00a0She reiterated her support for Israel in the ongoing war in Gaza when asked during the retreat about the conflict. \u201cWell, she\u2019s been an ardent supporter of Israel and has not wavered at all. Remember at one of the debates when she said \u2018finish them\u2019 referring to Hamas. I think she still feels very strongly about that,\u201d Tanenblatt said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/nikki-haley-donor-retreat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_debates-joe-biden-donald-trump", "text": "For two men who agree on so little, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump could agree on this: They needed to debate. After months of speculation over the traditional pre-election face-offs \u2013 when they would happen, what they would look like and whether the candidates would actually show up \u2013 the 2024 showdowns were quickly announced Wednesday morning after Biden\u2019s campaign laid out its criteria for participating. It was hardly a foregone conclusion. Trump skipped his party\u2019s primary debates, deeming them useless. Biden and his aides had long harbored deep skepticism about the traditional debate format and schedule. To Biden\u2019s team, the move to lay out its debate proposals seized back control of a narrative that he was unwilling or unable to square off against Trump. Some of the president\u2019s advisers hoped that by listing out their terms first, they could box Trump into a format he wouldn\u2019t have chosen for himself. On Wednesday, some Trump allies and advisers expressed frustration after Biden\u2019s public announcement that the quick acceptance of network debates left them playing catch up \u2014\u00a0something they described as particularly annoying\u00a0after Trump\u2019s campaign had repeatedly, and publicly, called on Biden to debate. Still, apart from Trump\u2019s desire to hold more than two debates and his urgings for a live audience, many of the conditions laid out in the Biden campaign\u2019s proposal were criteria the Trump campaign also wanted \u2013 namely, to move up the schedule by three months and to avoid sharing a stage with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The sudden resolution of one of the contest\u2019s biggest unanswered questions had actually been in the works for weeks, people familiar with the matter said, as the campaigns separately came to the conclusion that debates over the summer would benefit both their candidates and American voters. The calendar appears set for the earliest debate between Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in decades. And a campaign that had been trudging along slowly, through a GOP primary that seemed foretold and a fog of legal problems for Trump, has suddenly jolted into high gear. Howard Stern interview put gears in motion Biden\u2019s declaration last month to Howard Stern that he was \u201chappy\u201d to debate Trump, a statement that wasn\u2019t planned ahead of time, helped spur a chain of events leading up to Wednesday\u2019s announcements. Both candidates\u2019 campaigns believed that the earlier the men could debate, the better. It made little sense to debate after voters were able to cast ballots, which would have been the case if they stuck to the schedule proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Trump\u2019s advisers had privately expressed frustration at the commission, which had announced debates would begin mid-September. Susie Wiles and her fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita criticized the body after it denied their request for more and earlier debates. Trump\u2019s advisers argue they want at least four debates but would prefer there to be more. The campaign, and Wiles and LaCivita specifically, believe having Trump and Biden face-off onstage will only benefit the former president, the two advisers said. Trump\u2019s team believes Biden has declined both physically and mentally in the four years since they last debated in 2020, one adviser said. \u201cAnything in this campaign that provides a contrast will be important for us. And there\u2019s not a better contrast than Joe Biden having to defend a miserable record standing next to successful President Trump, whose energy and enthusiasm is always present,\u201d one of the senior advisers said. A Trump adviser said the campaign believed it was critical for Trump to be able to reach voters before they made a decision on their votes \u2014 a rationale echoed by Biden\u2019s team in its letter to the commission. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s failure, yet again, to schedule debates that will be meaningful to all voters \u2013 not just those who cast their ballots late in the fall or on Election Day \u2013 underscores the serious limitations of its outdated approach,\u201d Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote. Frustration with the Commission on Presidential Debates In recent weeks, after the commission seemed disinclined to agree to their requests on timing, Trump advisers began internally discussing ways to circumvent the commission altogether. Many advisers privately acknowledged they\u2019d likely be more successful in achieving the type of debates they want by having a network hold them, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN. Top members of Biden\u2019s team had long similarly harbored reservations about the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has organized the events for decades. Two of his top advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain, helped coauthor a report in 2015 recommending an overhaul to the debate system. In a statement on Wednesday, the commission said the sites it had already selected were \u201cprepared to host debates on dates chosen to accommodate early voters.\u00a0We will continue to be ready to execute this plan.\u201d For Biden\u2019s team, earlier debates hold another goal: bringing the contrast with Trump into living rooms at a moment when many potential voters haven\u2019t tuned in. In their view, an accelerated start of the general election campaign will force Americans to reckon with Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House in a way they haven\u2019t yet. \u201cOur campaign has been saying for months that democracy is literally at stake and is what\u2019s on the ballot in this election. The American people deserve to hear from \u2026 two of the individuals who have a chance of being elected president of the United States, that are going to represent them on the world stage, that are going to be in charge of the economy that affects their life every day,\u201d Biden\u2019s principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said on CNN. \u201cPresident Biden deeply believes this. We have nothing to hide.\u201d An intense start to the summer For Biden, debate preparation will compete with a heavy campaign travel schedule and two foreign trips: to France for the 80th anniversary of the June 6 landings at Normandy and to Italy for the Group of 7 summit. Trump, meanwhile, continues to grapple with a swirl of legal issues, including the conclusion of his New York hush money trial. Klain, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, is planning to take a vacation from his job as AirBnB\u2019s top lawyer to help Biden prepare. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Biden\u2019s personal attorney Bob Bauer, who played Trump in previous debate practice session, would reprise his role. Trump and his campaign have made debating Biden a key part of their campaign. During rallies, Trump has brought an extra podium to the stage to mock Biden\u2019s refusal to answer Trump\u2019s calls to debate. Last month,\u00a0surrogates received talking points that encouraged them to say that \u201cPresident Trump is ready to debate anytime, anyplace, and anywhere\u201d and that \u201cAmericans deserve a full chance to see both candidates on the same stage before they start voting.\u201d Seeking to take control of the media narrative back around the debates, Trump posted on Truth Social that he would be accepting a third debate on Fox News, which the Biden campaign swiftly rejected. Both campaigns had little interest in debating Kennedy, the third party candidate who could siphon votes from both Biden and Trump. As CNN previously reported, in recent weeks Kennedy has gone from a perceived nuisance to a political problem that the Trump campaign is eager to swiftly extinguish. Biden, meanwhile, has sought to blunt Kennedy\u2019s appeal to Democrats by appearing with other members of the Kennedy family. \u201cIt is still too early to tell who RFK would take votes from,\u201d one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \u201cWe absolutely believe that its possible he could take away from Trump in a general election.\u201d Even after accepting in short order the invitations from CNN and ABC, neither campaign sounded entirely sure the debates would actually occur.\u00a0The skepticism reflected the logistical tripwires and political considerations that could still forestall an eventual debate. \u201cWe\u2019ll see Donald Trump on June 27th in Atlanta \u2013 if he shows up,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said. \u201cI wonder whether or not he shows up,\u201d Trump told radio interviewer Hugh Hewitt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/debates-joe-biden-donald-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_what-to-know-history-of-presidential-debates", "text": "The decisions by President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday to agree to two presidential debates will ensure the continuation of a tradition that dates back to 1960. But it might look a little different this year: the candidates will first debate on June 27 on CNN, months ahead of the usual fall matchups, in events that will not be organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has overseen debates in every US presidential election cycle since 1988. It\u2019s just the latest evolution in the history of US presidential debates. A tradition that dates back to 1960 The first televised presidential debates, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960, occurred in television studios with no live audience present. Debates did not take place again until the 1976 election, and from then on, took place in front of live audiences that were instructed to not make noise aside from the beginning and ends of the debate. \u201cIn\u00a0\u201976,\u00a0the president was Gerald Ford. He had come into office because of Nixon\u2019s resignation. So he was in kind of a weak position. He\u2019s the one that actually challenged Jimmy Carter to debates, and that set in place this tradition that has existed ever since then of presidential debates,\u201d Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University,\u00a0previously told CNN\u2019s Zachary B. Wolf. Schroeder said there are typically two or three presidential debates and\u00a0one vice presidential debate per cycle. The importance of the presidential debates is, well, debatable: many credit Kennedy\u2019s narrow victory in 1960 with an appealing performance in the televised debate. Then-President Gerald Ford may have cost himself reelection when he fumbled a question about Soviet military strength in Eastern Europe in 1976. Ronald Reagan, formerly a professional actor, used strong debate performances against Democrats Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale to help secure two election victories, and an ill-advised decision to look at his watch in the 1992 debate became a memorable footnote in President George H.W. Bush\u2019s defeat that year against Bill Clinton. On the other hand, in an era of increasing partisan divides, it\u2019s unclear how many minds are left to be made up. Either way, the debates are likely to present the candidates with some of their best opportunities to reach millions of Americans: around\u00a073 million people\u00a0watched the first debate between Trump and Biden in 2020, when it was broadcast on 16 channels. Many more probably watched online or encountered snippets. A record 84 million watched the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. This year\u2019s schedule The debates between Biden and Trump will be a historically early and will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. Wednesday morning, both campaigns announced that they had accepted CNN\u2019s invitation for a debate on June 27 and later revealed that they had agreed to debate on ABC on September 10. The debates will be hosted by news organizations rather than the Commission on Presidential Debates, from which the Republican National Committee withdrew its participation in 2022, citing concerns over what it said were biased moderators and debates that were too late in the election calendar in an age of increasingly early voting. Despite the RNC\u2019s withdrawal, the commission\u00a0announced\u00a0dates for three presidential debates last November: a first debate scheduled for September 16 in Texas, a second on October 1 in Virginia and a third on October 9 in Utah. In a letter on Wednesday explaining the campaign\u2019s decision to not participate in the commission\u2019s 2024 debates, Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said the campaign proposed an altered schedule because the original dates are \u201cout of step with changes with changes in the structure of our elections and the interests of voters,\u201d pointing to the timeline of early voting, the way the commission has built debates as an \u201centertainment spectacle\u201d and the commission being \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to enforce rules in 2020 debates. The CNN debate will be held without a studio audience, satisfying a condition outlined by the Biden campaign. It\u2019s a sharp departure from previous events that were often interrupted by responses from audience members. In addition to the two debates that were agreed upon on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s team also called for the candidates to participate in two additional ones in July and August, twice the number requested by Biden. The Biden campaign sidestepped questions about that request on Wednesday. Biden and Trump will likely be the only candidates on stage Biden and Trump have been their party\u2019s presumptive nominees for months despite each state\u2019s primaries continuing to take place. It\u2019s likely, though not yet certain, that the stage will feature only the two men and not include Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who, per CNN\u2019s qualifications for participation on Wednesday, is not yet on enough states\u2019 ballots to meet the 270 electoral vote threshold necessary to be elected president and has not maintained a minimal 15% polling average in major polls recently. Kennedy, who has repeatedly sought to debate Biden and Trump, did not take Wednesday\u2019s announcements well, accusing the two major candidates of \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the stage. In the commission era, the only non-major-party candidate to take part in debates was Ross Perot in 1992. Perot was not included when he ran again in 1996. CNN\u2019s Zachary B. Wolf, Betsy Klein,\u00a0Michael Williams\u00a0and\u00a0Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/what-to-know-history-of-presidential-debates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
