{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_john-roberts-recording-what-matters", "text": "The funny thing about \u201csecret\u201d recordings made of public figures is that they generally confirm what everyone already knew. The propriety of liberal activist Lauren Windsor pretending to be a religious conservative in order to surreptitiously record Supreme Court justices attending a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society can certainly be debated. The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters", "text": "Hunter Biden has never sought elective office or been part of a presidential administration, but he has loomed large in the American political conversation for years. His conviction in Delaware, the first federal criminal trial of a president\u2019s son in US history, is for allegedly lying on a federal firearms background check and owning a firearm for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs and could land him behind bars. It has put a personal drama of addiction and betrayal in the public eye, an unwanted embarrassment for the Biden family. Read more from CNN\u2019s team covering the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, his brother\u2019s widow \u2013 with whom he had an affair \u2013 and his daughter all testified. Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction will also serve as a sort of foil for former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction for lying on business records in New York. That\u2019s not to equate the two sets of charges or the trials. Trump was convicted for hiding his compensation of hush money paid to keep an alleged affair out of the media during the 2016 presidential campaign. He is also running again in the 2024 presidential election, while Hunter Biden is now an artist. Hunter Biden also faces tax evasion charges in Los Angeles later this year, another case brought by the former Trump-appointed US attorney turned special counsel whose planned plea deal with Biden to settle both the gun and tax problems imploded last year when a Trump-appointed judge refused to accept it. Trump feared a Joe Biden candidacy ahead of the 2020 election, and hoping to tarnish Biden\u2019s reputation, in 2019 he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to spin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. Trump pushed Zelensky to focus on Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as vice president, at a time when Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. Joe Biden was one of many Western leaders who had advocated for the ouster of a prosecutor in Ukraine because he was not pursuing corruption cases. Read a CNN fact check about Trump\u2019s Ukraine claims. Democrats impeached Trump (the first of two times) for improperly dragging a foreign leader into US politics. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. But that bad experience did nothing to stop Trump or Republicans from making allegations about Hunter Biden. At the Republican presidential debate in 2020, Trump brought up Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and also alleged that he was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the Navy Reserve for cocaine use, which is not true. Hunter Biden was administratively discharged, which is standard procedure when an officer fails a drug test. Read a CNN fact check about the discharge claim. In fact, if you search \u201cHunter Biden\u201d in the CNN Facts First database, there are many results. Among them: Did Hunter Biden have a job before his father became vice president? Yes. Did Joe Biden profit from his son Hunter\u2019s career? There\u2019s no evidence. What is Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with China? He did business with Chinese partners. The sheer volume of these fact checks is worth noting as proof, if nothing else, that he is so frequently cited by his father\u2019s political opponents.  When Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives in January 2023, one of their high-profile moves was to launch an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, most of it built on trying to tie the president to his son\u2019s former business career. While House Republicans have referred Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden for criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading Congress, the impeachment inquiry has seemingly fallen apart without unanimous support from Republicans and no evidence of wrongdoing by the president. For Hunter Biden, his name is both a blessing and a curse. It was with help from his last name that he built a lucrative career as an attorney, then lobbyist, who then  did business with companies in Ukraine and China. It is because of his name that he has been so scrutinized. It is a trade-off Hunter Biden has been experiencing for years. When Joe Biden was tapped as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008, they made a point about not consorting with lobbyists. Hunter, then a lobbyist, ended his lucrative lobbying contracts a few months before the election that year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_g7-loan-ukraine-russian-investments", "text": "Group of Seven leaders have reached an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, a senior administration official confirmed Thursday. The United States and its G7 contemporaries have placed a high value on showing their support for Ukraine during this year\u2019s summit, which is taking place in Italy. While Ukraine is not a G7 member, its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, attended the summit and participated in a Thursday evening joint news conference with Biden. \u201cWould we stand with Ukraine?\u201d Biden said at the news conference. \u201cWould we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny? The United States, the G7 and countries around the world have consistently answered that question by saying yes we will. We will say it again \u2026 we\u2019re going to stand with Ukraine.\u201d The leaders will soon issue a joint communiqu\u00e9, the product of \u201cyears\u201d of negotiation complicated by a patchwork of jurisdictional laws that required the direct involvement of Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, among other top US officials. \u201cWhen you have a commitment at the highest political levels, technocrats act and technical details get worked out,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,\u201d the senior official said. The official added that it\u2019s \u201conly fair that we close the gap by making Russia pay, not our taxpayers, and we found a way to do so that respects the rule of law in every jurisdiction.\u201d During the news conference, Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine after both leaders signed an agreement vowing lasting US support for Ukraine\u2019s defense now and in the future. But Biden might be making a commitment that he cannot fulfill if his political rival, former President Donald Trump, again wins the White House in November. Further US support for Ukraine could be jeopardized under a new Trump administration. The former president has long spoken admirably of strongmen, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and shocked world leaders by saying earlier this year that he would let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to US partner countries who don\u2019t fulfill certain defense spending obligations. For his part, Zelensky appeared outwardly optimistic that his country would retain US support no matter who is the president. \u201cThey work based on the voice of their people and it is impossible without people,\u201d Zelensky, who was speaking Ukrainian, said of US leaders. \u201cI am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents \u2026 and it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity\u00a0within this or that state \u2014 and\u00a0if the people are with us, any\u00a0leader will be with us in this\u00a0struggle for freedom,\u201d he added, according to a realtime translator. The loan will be drawn from funds frozen by Western leaders in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While just $3 billion in frozen funds is located in US banks, a much larger share, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars, is located in banks in Europe. Negotiators have focused on a loan amount of about $50 billion. It will take some time before Ukraine begins to receive this money, but the official said the effort would \u201cmove with urgency\u201d and the commitment remains \u201cto be ready to disburse $50 billion this calendar year.\u201d If the loan is disbursed by the end of 2024, it would ensure the money got to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine. In the United States, which has remained a crucial ally to Ukraine, promises of funding for defense systems and military weaponry are known to be difficult to fulfill. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress held up critically needed military funding for the war-torn country after Trump came out against a deal. That holdup carried with it real-world consequences to Ukraine\u2019s defense capabilities. Though the Senate would eventually pass a $95 billion aid package that included funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Ukrainian officials have said that aid came too late for troops on the ground. The agreement reached in Italy on Thursday would free up chests of funds in Europe that would not be hampered by further political bickering in the United States. \u201cThe next steps are to enshrine the communiqu\u00e9 commitments with the EU 27, the full membership, then we need to write contracts between the lenders \u2026 the recipient, which is Ukraine, and the intermediaries,\u201d the official said. From there, there will be an agreement on a disbursal schedule. Should a peace agreement be reached and the war end, there is also a plan in place: \u201cG7 leaders have committed that the assets will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damages that\u2019s caused. So if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized and keep generating interest to repay the loans, or Russia pays for the damage it\u2019s caused. Either way, there\u2019s a source of repayment.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/g7-loan-ukraine-russian-investments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-investigation-what-matters", "text": "It was nearly a year ago that CNN first reported about a cover-up at the Coast Guard Academy. That initial report about how the academy kept secret its own review of decades of sexual assault cover-ups continues to reverberate. This week, the Coast Guard Academy official in charge of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, resigned in protest and said the Coast Guard had made her an unwitting accomplice to a cover-up. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable,\u201d Norenberg said in a statement. Watch her appearance on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d. Separately, the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is scheduled to testify about the scandal on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where she will face tough questioning about why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. How does investigative reporting like this come to be? It took a team of\u00a0journalists\u00a0from CNN Investigates,\u00a0including Melanie Hicken,\u00a0Blake Ellis, Audrey Ash, Curt Devine and Pamela Brown. I emailed with Hicken and Ellis, reporters who have been working on this story since the beginning. Our conversation is below. WOLF: You\u2019ve been covering this Coast Guard story for some time. What was the first thread you pulled on it, and how has it unraveled? HICKEN and ELLIS: Our Coast Guard reporting all started with a young woman named Hope Hicks who was a student at a different service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy. In an anonymous blog post, she wrote about how she had been raped by her boss while out at sea \u2013 prompting a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry. As we started digging into her case, we became fascinated by this little-known industry.\u00a0We\u00a0spent months talking to merchant mariners who were assaulted while working on commercial ships and learned more about how the justice process works in the commercial shipping world \u2013\u00a0ultimately discovering that a number of sexual assaults were going unpunished and that it was all happening under the Coast Guard\u2019s watch.\u00a0So, that was the turning point where we started turning our attention to the Coast Guard. It is only because of this initial reporting on the Coast Guard and the maritime industry that we were able to ultimately break the news of the Fouled Anchor scandal. It took months to develop the trust of sources, obtain key records\u00a0and conduct sensitive interviews with victims. WOLF: A key part of the story is Operation Fouled Anchor, the secret internal probe of cover-ups. Has the Coast Guard acknowledged a cover-up?\u00a0 HICKEN and ELLIS: Reporting on this story has been so interesting because Fouled Anchor essentially ended up being a cover-up of past cover-ups.\u00a0The internal probe substantiated years of sexual assault at the US Coast Guard Academy and revealed how victims\u2019 complaints were ignored and, at times, covered up \u2013 allowing some offenders to rise to high-level positions in the Coast Guard and other military branches. Through our reporting, we learned that while there were originally plans to come clean to Congress about the reporting and its damning findings, Coast Guard leaders ultimately chose to bury it \u2013 even going so far as to make a list of pros and cons of disclosure. The Coast Guard\u2019s current leader has apologized to the workforce and Congress but has been careful to avoid calling the suppression of the Fouled Anchor investigation a cover-up. WOLF: Has there been any follow-up to look at some of those assaults from years ago? HICKEN and ELLIS: Operation Fouled Anchor itself was launched in 2014 to look at those earlier assaults when an academy graduate claimed that her allegations of rape from years earlier had never been investigated and her attacker had gone on to become a top officer in the Air Force. Despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, Fouled Anchor investigators found that most of the alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated at the time. Even after the cases were reopened during Fouled Anchor however, few alleged perpetrators were held accountable. The assailant in the case that started Fouled Anchor was the only person to face criminal charges in military court as a result of the probe, but an appeals court ended up ruling in his favor and dismissing the charges, saying that the military had missed its window to prosecute because the Coast Guard waited nearly two decades to investigate the victim\u2019s allegations. We learned that two other accused perpetrators were discreetly pushed to retire from the Coast Guard, but that there were nearly 40 cases where the Coast Guard no longer had jurisdiction over the alleged attackers and local and federal criminal statutes had long run out of time, so no action was taken at all. In terms of what is happening now, we know that the Coast Guard is currently investigating an officer for sexually harassing and groping a cadet who reported him to the academy two decades earlier\u00a0at the Coast Guard Academy (the officer\u2019s attorney denies the allegations). The former cadet brought up the allegations during\u00a0testimony\u00a0at a congressional hearing last year, but the Coast Guard didn\u2019t launch the criminal investigation until months later, after the woman said she flagged his name on a promotion list to senators. Another woman has asked Congress to reopen her rape case from 2005, which the Coast Guard has claimed it cannot pursue despite findings at the time that he had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her since he is not currently under Coast Guard jurisdiction. WOLF: There\u2019s a hearing in Congress this week. Shannon Norenberg resigned in protest. Has there been any accountability yet at the Coast Guard Academy or in the Coast Guard? HICKEN and ELLIS: It sounds like the Coast Guard\u2019s current leader, Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, will be facing a lot of tough questions at the hearing. So far, she has wanted the agency to focus on the future and make changes to policies that she hopes will help prevent sexual assault and better support survivors. But many Coast Guard members are frustrated by two major issues: that to date, the leaders who covered up Operation Fouled Anchor still haven\u2019t been held accountable and that Fagan is not acknowledging how much of an issue sexual assault still is in the service today. Shannon Norenberg was angry that she was used as part of what she described as a \u201ccruel coverup\u201d where victims and Congress were both deceived, but she is also frustrated that more hasn\u2019t changed at the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 saying perpetrators are still facing little accountability. WOLF: Having covered this for so long, what is it about the Coast Guard Academy that allowed this kind of cover-up culture to develop? Is this a problem specific to the Coast Guard or the academy? HICKEN and ELLIS: Many of the issues we have seen playing out at the Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard at large, such as fear of retaliation for speaking out about assaults, a lack of accountability for alleged perpetrators and a boys-club culture, were very similar to what we heard from those in the US Merchant Marine Academy community when we first started this reporting several years ago. We have also heard from assault survivors from across the military service who argue that our country still has a long way to go in combating military sexual assault and attempting to make survivors whole. We have also been told by some in the organization that because the Coast Guard does not fall under the Department of Defense, like the other military branches, that it has historically escaped the same level of scrutiny. Many are hopeful that maybe that can change with people who have been terrified to speak up finally feeling like they can. WOLF: You include your email addresses at the end of your stories and ask for tips to investigate. Does that ever turn into stories? HICKEN and ELLIS: Yes! We have received so much helpful information through tips in response to our stories, and many of the sexual assault survivors we have spoken with throughout our reporting originally contacted us through our tips email (watchdog@cnn.com). Many current and former Coast Guard employees have also shared information with us anonymously that has hugely informed our reporting and led to multiple follow-up stories. We\u2019re always looking for new story ideas, and a variety of our past investigations have stemmed from tips from readers, so we welcome emails!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/coast-guard-investigation-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_nato-agreement-ukraine-aid", "text": "NATO defense ministers are expected to finalize an agreement on Friday that will give\u00a0the alliance\u00a0greater control over security assistance and training for Ukraine\u2019s military, an attempt some officials say is meant to give Europe greater responsibility over the aid amid uncertainty\u00a0over the outcome of the US presidential election this fall. The possibility that former President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of providing US military support to NATO and Europe, could win the election \u201cis a huge part\u201d of why NATO is moving forward with the consolidation plan, said one official familiar with the discussions. It is also a way to give Europe more responsibility\u00a0over\u00a0the training and equipping of Ukraine as the extent of the\u00a0US\u2019 commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia\u00a0after the election remains unclear, the official said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the intent in a news conference on Thursday, saying NATO provides \u201cmore than 99% of all military support to Ukraine \u2026 so it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts.\u201d \u201cThis will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv, and address both immediate and long-term needs,\u201d Stoltenberg said. Stoltenberg added that the effort will be headquartered in Wiesbaden, Germany and fall under NATO command, led by a 3-star General reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Chris Cavoli, who is also the head of US European Command. Earlier in the day on Thursday, Stoltenberg said the \u201cwhole idea\u201d of the new framework was to \u201cminimize the risk for gaps and delays\u201d \u2014 particularly after a months-long delay by the US in providing additional security aid had real negative impacts on Ukraine\u2019s ability to fight Russia. \u201c[T]he whole idea is to minimize the risk for gaps and delays as we saw earlier this year, because the gaps in delays in both the provision of military support from the United States but also from several European allies, made a difference on the battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one of the reasons why the Russians are now able to push and to actually occupy more land in Ukraine.\u201d Stoltenberg also said Thursday that he has proposed NATO allies provide Ukraine a minimum of 40 billion euros a year \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d \u2014 a number that he said allies have already approximately provided annually since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022. Ukraine needs the annual funds \u201cto ensure they have the resources to repel Russian aggression against their country,\u201d he said. CNN previously reported the options around ensuring long-term support for Ukraine, which one senior European diplomat described at the time as \u201cfuture-proofing.\u201d A senior US Defense Department official told reporters on Thursday it was important to ensure that the capabilities and troops assisting Ukraine is being done with \u201can eye \u2026 towards NATO interoperability and integration.\u201d \u201c[R]ight now it\u2019s pretty ad hoc,\u201d the official said. \u201cA nation raises its hand and says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the artillery coalition,\u2019 another says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the drone coalition\u2019 \u2014 who\u2019s actually sitting down and mapping these things out and making sure that that force that\u2019s being built is going to make sense to deter and defend against what Ukraine needs to deter and defend against? Who\u2019s thinking through the extent to which that force is interoperable with Polish forces, for example. Earlier this week, the plan to centralize the alliance\u2019s military support for Ukraine overcame a major hurdle when Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said that while Hungary will not participate in the scheme, it will not veto it. \u201cThe prime minister has assured me that Hungary will not oppose these efforts, enabling other allies to move forward, and he has confirmed that Hungary will continue to meet its NATO commitments in full,\u201d Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group and NATO defense ministers\u2019 meetings are happening in Brussels as a Group of Seven nations summit in Italy is taking place, where support for Ukraine remains a top issue. Leaders of G7 nations have agreed to loan Ukraine money backed by profits from frozen Russian investments. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that the loan amount totals roughly $50 billion, which is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024 \u2014 before a potential change in US administrations. The US and Ukraine are also\u00a0expected to sign\u00a0a long-term security agreement at the G7 summit, after months of negotiations, but could ultimately be undone by a new administration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/nato-agreement-ukraine-aid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_what-to-know-about-the-supreme-courts-ruling-allowing-mifepristone-to-stay-on-the-market", "text": "The Supreme Court\u00a0unanimously rejected a lawsuit on Thursday challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone, allowing the drug to stay on the market. The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Though technical, the court\u2019s reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Medication abortion\u00a0accounts for nearly two-thirds of all US abortions, according to some estimates.\u00a0The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy, and it has been shown to be safe and effective. The pill is also often prescribed for miscarriage treatment. Here\u2019s what to know about the ruling: Plaintiffs had no standing The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the opinion, said the parties do not have standing \u201csimply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities \u2014 at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-regulation of others.\u201d Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone \u2014 the first drug in the medication abortion process \u2014 is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. Biden blames GOP for allowing challenge to abortion access President Joe Biden cast blame on Republicans for the very existence of the case, taking aim at GOP elected officials\u2019 \u201cextreme and dangerous agenda\u201d on reproductive rights. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid. Meantime, former President Donald Trump cautioned Republicans not to go too far on abortion in a meeting with the House GOP conference. The big picture Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement. But the court\u2019s technical reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. Much of the opinion covered the various legal thresholds a plaintiff must reach to make it appropriate for courts to intervene in a dispute. In addition, the Supreme Court is yet to release a decision on a case related to abortions in health emergencies. The justices will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have\u00a0strict bans on abortion.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_protesters-republican-convention-milwaukee-park", "text": "The US Secret Service is\u00a0in talks\u00a0to expand its security perimeter around the Milwaukee arena where the Republican Party will host its national convention this year, three\u00a0sources familiar with the plans told CNN. The discussed\u00a0expansion\u00a0would\u00a0bar protesters from being allowed to gather in a large park near the venue. The talks\u00a0come\u00a0after a monthslong dispute between the Secret Service and the GOP over security measures around the convention, which will take place from July 15 to 18. The party has accused the agency of ignoring its concerns, while the Secret Service has said Republicans were undermining efforts to keep the event safe. The Washington Post first reported on the new security measures under consideration. In a statement to CNN, Trump campaign adviser Danielle Alvarez praised what she described as the Secret Service\u2019s decision to keep protestors away from Pere Marquette Park, the largest public park near the venue. \u201cWe applaud Secret Service leadership for including Pere Marquette Park in the security perimeter and we implore local officials to expedite the permit application for this park and choose a different location for the First Amendment zone,\u201d\u00a0Alvarez said. However, an official involved in the process warned that no formal decision has\u00a0been made at this point and that the Secret Service is still waiting to learn whether the GOP\u2019s permit to hold its own activities in the park will be approved. At present, it is unclear whether the city of Milwaukee will allow any such activities to take place in the park. \u201cAs of right now, the security plan for the 2024 Republican National Convention, which includes the security perimeter, is still in development,\u201d Alexandria Worley, a spokesperson for the US Secret Service, told CNN. \u201cThe U.S. Secret Service does not determine demonstration zones for National Special Security Events \u2013 those decisions are made by the host city. The U.S. Secret Service is continuing to work closely with our public safety partners, the City of Milwaukee, and the Republican National Committee to ensure the highest level of safety and security during the 2024 Republican National Convention,\u201d Worley added. In April, Republican National Committee counsel Todd Steggerda sent a letter\u00a0asking the Secret Service to keep protesters farther back from the July convention in Milwaukee\u00a0than what had been planned at the time. He wrote that the city\u2019s proposal \u201ccreates an elevated and untenable safety risk to the attending public\u201d and would place demonstrators in a one-block park that\u00a0\u201cwill\u00a0force thousands of peaceful attendees and demonstrators \u2026 to be in extremely close, consistent and unavoidable proximity.\u201d The RNC letter came during a peak in pro-Palestinian rallies at major universities\u00a0across the US that saw police removing demonstrators on some campuses, resulting in detainments and arrests. The committee said in the letter that\u00a0\u201crecent\u00a0college and university campus clashes\u201d have shown that forced proximity causes heightened tensions and increases the risk of confrontations and law enforcement intervention. When the RNC announced in 2022 that it would host this year\u2019s convention in Milwaukee, the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Cavalier Johnson, dismissed security concerns, saying,\u00a0\u201cOur\u00a0police department is well-versed, and I think they are prepared for the convention.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/protesters-republican-convention-milwaukee-park/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_trump-european-union-elections-analysis", "text": "In June 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union in a populist revolt that foreshadowed Donald Trump\u2019s shock outsider election win a few months later. Now, in June 2024, far-right candidates, many of whom share Trump\u2019s populist nationalism, hostility to immigrants, searing economic message, and disdain for governing elites and globalist institutions, just won sweeping gains in EU elections. Is political lightning about to strike twice? US voters don\u2019t take direction from foreigners, and American presidential elections, which play out state by state, are far different from those for the European Union. Plus, Trump\u2019s win eight years ago had more to do with the deficiencies of Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign than Brexit. But President Joe Biden should be concerned. The latest campaign in Europe successfully road-tested a message that mixes a potent political cocktail \u2014 public anger over what is perceived to be out-of-control migration, the pain of voters facing high prices and the cost to individuals of fighting climate change. Trump is hitting these themes hard in battleground states that will decide the White House race. Another lesson of the European elections is that in an age of inflation, incumbents are vulnerable to a disgruntled electorate. When Biden arrives at the G7 summit in Italy this week, he\u2019ll join a quartet of four other politically diminished Western leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are smarting from their rebuke in European elections that rewarded far-right parties that echo the continent\u2019s dark past. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s low approval ratings mean he might not even lead his Liberal Party into elections due by the end of next year. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to be wiped out in next month\u2019s general election after 14 years of Conservative rule. Ironically, the most secure European leader at the G7 will be Giorgia Meloni, the right-wing prime minister of Italy, a country known for dispensing with leaders at a hectic rate. Meloni\u2019s party won big over the weekend, making her one of the most powerful leaders on the other side of the Atlantic. A saving grace for Biden might be that the US election is not a traditional face-off between an insurgent outsider and an unpopular sitting president. Trump is, in many ways, an incumbent himself who boasts a controversial White House legacy and carries heavy political baggage as a twice-impeached and convicted former president. And populist nationalism isn\u2019t on the rise everywhere. Biden led a surprisingly successful midterm election campaign against \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d influences in the GOP in 2022. An expected return to power by the Labour Party in Britain next month would buck the trend of ascendant right-wing parties. And Poland just rejected eight years of populist rule that drew inspiration from Trump. Macron reacted to the surge of the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen with a bold gambit that stunned commentators watching his post-election speech in TV studios. He dissolved Parliament and called new elections. The National Rally is an evolution of the ultra-right-wing anti-immigrant National Front, which has never managed to navigate the country\u2019s two-round electoral system to win the presidency. Le Pen has now moderated some policies to appeal to a broader group of voters. Macron, who heads a centrist party that was routed in the European elections, may be betting that the higher turnout in legislative elections could reverse the trend. A post-election anti-far-right coalition could also emerge in Parliament. But if the National Rally wins the two-part elections that culminate weeks before the Paris Olympics, Macron may be forced to appoint 28-year-old far-right star Jordan Bardella as prime minister in an awkward cohabitation deal. Cynics wonder whether Macron secretly hopes that a far-right government could be so disastrous that it could tarnish Le Pen\u2019s hopes of succeeding him in 2027. Macron told voters his gamble was based on trust \u201cin the capacity of the French people to make the most just choice for themselves and for future generations.\u201d He\u2019s implicitly beseeching voters despondent about the economy to save the foundational values of their country, billing his announcement as an act of \u201ctrust in our democracy.\u201d That\u2019s rather similar to the warning that American democracy is in deep peril and needs to be saved by voters, which Biden spelled out at Macron\u2019s side last week during the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day Normandy landings. That\u2019s why the White House will be watching French election results on July 7 even more closely than Sunday\u2019s EU contests.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/trump-european-union-elections-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_anna-wintour-holly-valance-london-fundraisers-biden-trump", "text": "President Joe Biden and former President Trump held competing fundraisers in London on Wednesday, sources told CNN, amid an intensifying race for campaign cash and signs that the former president is gaining some financial ground. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, hosted Biden\u2019s event,\u00a0while actress and political activist Holly Valance hosted the Trump event, which\u00a0Trump\u2019s son,\u00a0Don Jr. and his\u00a0fianc\u00e9e,\u00a0Kimberly Guilfoyle,\u00a0attended. Ric Grenell, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Germany,\u00a0posted\u00a0on X that Trump\u2019s event raised $2 million. London has long been fertile fundraising ground for American politicians, who are allowed to solicit donations from US citizens abroad. Gwyneth Paltrow, then a resident of the UK, held a fundraiser for then-President Barack Obama during his reelection bid in 2012. And then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney held a fundraiser in the British capital during a visit the same year. Wintour, a longtime Democrat, previously hosted a fundraiser for Biden during Paris Fashion Week in March. The Financial Times first reported on the fundraisers, which come amid signs of an increasingly competitive money race. Throughout early 2024, Biden\u2019s reelection effort dominated the fundraising landscape, outraising Trump\u2019s team significantly during the first three months of the year while building a substantial war chest that the campaign said totaled more than $192 million across all of its allied committees entering May. In April, however, Trump\u2019s first full month as the de-facto GOP nominee, the former president\u2019s team raised $76 million, significantly ahead of Biden\u2019s $51 million haul in the same month, and the first time that Trump\u2019s team outraised Biden\u2019s team this year. Trump also benefited from a fundraising bonanza following his historic conviction in the criminal hush money trial in New York at the end of last month. His team sent out numerous fundraising appeals to supporters in the aftermath of the high-profile verdict announcement. As a result, Trump\u2019s campaign and its affiliated committees announced they had hauled in $141 million in May, with more than one-third of that total, $53 million, coming in just the 24 hours following the verdict at the end of the month. Trump\u2019s team did not announce a cash-on-hand total when announcing its May fundraising surge, but the $141 million that it raised is significantly more than Biden\u2019s team has raised in any month so far this year. And it could help close the cash-on-hand gap between the principal campaign committees, with the Biden campaign holding a $35 million advantage at the end of April. Biden\u2019s team has not yet announced their May fundraising totals, but while being outraised by Trump in recent months, the campaign has repeatedly pointed to its substantial war chest of $192 million across all allied committees at the end of April, which they described as the highest cash-on-hand figure for any Democratic candidate in history and one they say positions the president to compete effectively with the former president. Biden advertising blitz Biden\u2019s team has also put its early cash advantage into play, dominating the TV advertising landscape during the first half of the year. According to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact, since Super Tuesday, when Trump effectively secured the GOP presidential nomination, through Wednesday, Biden\u2019s campaign had spent $47.8 million on advertising, blitzing battleground states, while Trump\u2019s campaign has spent just $105,000. Trump\u2019s reelection effort has effectively left its paid advertising to allied outside groups so far, as opposed to the campaign, but the advertising gap remains when accounting for all outside spending from both parties in the presidential race. Including all advertisers, Democrats have outspent Republicans on presidential advertising by about $81.2 million to $31.9 million, according to AdImpact data, a gap roughly equivalent to the Biden campaign\u2019s ad spending alone. Further complicating the financial picture is the significant strain that Trump\u2019s legal troubles have placed on his reelection effort. Save America, a leadership PAC that has taken a lead role in paying legal fees for the myriad cases facing the former president, has had to divert nearly $80 million to legal expenses since the start of 2021 \u2013 funds that could otherwise go toward staff, organizing, paid messaging, and other campaign activities.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/anna-wintour-holly-valance-london-fundraisers-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_felons-inmates-voting-what-matters", "text": "Both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, face sentencing for nonviolent felonies before Election Day. Although it seems unlikely either will be behind bars on November 5, it\u2019s worth noting that how and whether felons and people otherwise detained can cast election ballots has developed into a major civil rights issue in recent years. The rules for how felons, inmates and those facing trial can cast ballots vary from state to state, and a number of recently enacted laws and ballot initiatives will change things further in 2024. In California, where Hunter Biden lives, for instance, only people who are serving time in prison are ineligible to vote, according to a database maintained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In Delaware, where he was convicted in federal court, there are more restrictions on felons voting. In Florida, where Trump lives, there are more restrictions on felons voting than in New York, where Trump was convicted in state court. There are only a few places \u2013 Vermont, Maine and the District of Colombia \u2013 where everyone can vote, even if they\u2019re convicted felons serving time in prison. Everywhere else in the US places prohibitions on incarcerated felons, and some states include other prohibitions. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Kimberly Berryman traveled to Nevada, where Tuesday was primary day and, for the first time, people who are detained, for a variety of reasons, were able to vote despite their incarceration. They met inmates casting ballots for the first time in their lives. Watch their full report. Nevada\u2019s state government gave felons who\u00a0have been released from prison the ability to vote back in 2019. That still left a population of people who are not convicted of a felony but are detained in jail in the lurch. A new law passed this year in Nevada required jails to facilitate access to voting for those non-felons inside jails in the state. Tuesday\u2019s primary was the first test. \u201cTheir vote should not be any less important than the individuals that are out here,\u201d Sadmira Ramic, a voting rights staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, told Murray and Berryman. \u201cThey face those barriers that we here on the outside don\u2019t even really think about.\u201d One major issue is confusion. Unfounded allegations of illegitimate and illegal votes or outright rigged elections have caused confusion among inmates about where they stand, so they often don\u2019t vote at all. For instance, despite Florida voters overwhelmingly agreeing in 2018 to reenfranchise felons in that state, a series of actions by the legislature complicated voting for felons, leading to court battles and confusion. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, made a show of trying to prosecute people for illegally voting in 2022. The ACLU has worked with voting rights groups in Nevada to make sure detained people who have the right to vote can access that right this year, but at one point threatened a lawsuit in order to make sure access to polling booths was granted by primary day. In a presidential election that could be decided by a small fraction of votes in key states like Nevada, even a small number of additional votes could, in theory, change the outcome. Nevada is also the site of a hotly contested Senate race that could determine which party controls the Senate next year. Jagada Chambers, a former inmate who is now a rights restoration coordinator for Silver State Voices, a voting rights group, told Murray and Berryman she hopes politicians will see the potential of asking for the votes of people who are detained. \u201cIn Clark County, you have potential victories lying in those cells,\u201d Chambers said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/felons-inmates-voting-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_us-ukraine-security-agreement-g7", "text": "The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US\u2019 long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations. The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. But the pledge is expected to be an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201d the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he\u2019d \u201cencourage\u201d Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d if Europe didn\u2019t increase its defense funding. The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine\u2019s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said.\u00a0An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine\u2019s defense. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday that the US\u2019 commitment to Ukraine \u201cwill continue to be right up front and clear\u201d at the G7, and that the US \u201cwill take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine fight for freedom.\u201d President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet during the summit, Kirby said, and the US will announce steps to unlock Russia\u2019s frozen assets for use in Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction after the war ends. The pledge the US and Ukraine are expected to sign will be similar to the 14 other bilateral agreements Ukraine has already reached with other allies, including the UK, France and Germany.\u00a0The US-Ukraine agreement will be the 15th\u00a0such deal signed, one of the sources said, and 17 other countries have committed to negotiating similar bilateral security pacts with Ukraine. As part of the deal, the US will promise to hold consultations with Ukraine immediately following a future attack by Russia to determine next steps, said the people familiar with the agreement\u2019s contours. The UK, France and Germany also included provisions calling for such talks within 24 hours of a Russian attack. But the bilateral agreement with the US, like with Ukraine\u2019s other allies, will not include a mutual defense clause, which would commit them to defending Ukraine militarily in the event of another attack. While Zelensky has welcomed the bilateral commitments, he has said repeatedly that they are not a\u00a0substitute for full NATO membership, which does have a mutual defense provision known as Article V. The agreement comes as the US-Ukrainian relationship has begun to recover after faltering late last year and into this year amid a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine \u2013 something Biden personally apologized to Zelensky for during a meeting in Paris last week. Biden also recently agreed to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike into Russia directly, a major shift that Ukraine had been asking for months as Russia pummeled Kharkiv with missiles from just across the border.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/us-ukraine-security-agreement-g7/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial", "text": "One month after Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial began, and with weeks of testimony still to come, the prosecution and its witnesses have painted a politically damning portrait of the New Jersey Democrat, who chaired the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee until stepping down last fall after being indicted. But for all the sharp angles and colorful flourishes delivered by witnesses for the government \u2013 none more so than turncoat businessman Jose Uribe, who pleaded guilty to multiple counts as part of a cooperation agreement that put him on the stand for parts of the past four days \u2013 some of the underlying questions from the beginning of the trial still appear unresolved. Uribe delivered the most detailed testimony to date placing Menendez, 70, at the center of an alleged bribery scheme in which he had previously appeared as a marginal figure. Instead, it had been the senator\u2019s then-girlfriend (and now wife), Nadine, appearing in nearly every scene of the legal drama \u2013 prosecutors describing her as a glorified fixer for her partner; the defense insisting she was pulling the strings herself. Nadine, who along with her husband and co-defendants Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes, has pleaded not guilty to their alleged roles in the scheme, is expected to go on trial separately in August. The senator disclosed last month that his wife has breast cancer. Together, the four have been accused of assorted roles in the alleged bribery scheme, spanning from cattle slaughterhouses in the American Midwest to the inner workings of the Egyptian government. Here are five takeaways from the prosecution\u2019s case, and the defense\u2019s pushback, as the trial enters its second month. For whom the (tiny) bell tolls The story, as Uribe told it, was a thrilling one. Face-to-face at last, following months of drinks, dinners and written correspondence with Nadine, Uribe was alone with the senator in September 2019. They were seated at a patio table in the backyard of Nadine\u2019s suburban home and, after a brief chat, Menendez asked Uribe for the names of the associates he was trying to shield from prosecution or investigation. Realizing he had nothing to write on, Uribe testified, Menendez called out \u201cmon amour\u201d to Nadine and then rang a small bell on the table. At that, Nadine emerged from inside with paper. Uribe scribbled the details for Menendez, who pocketed the information. The next morning, Menendez welcomed then-New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal to his Newark office, where he raised concerns with\u00a0the state\u2019s top prosecutor, according to Grewal\u2019s account,\u00a0about an ongoing criminal case.\u00a0(Grewal testified that Menendez never explicitly identified the case or the defendants by name.) Following the\u00a0brief meeting,\u00a0Grewal\u2019s\u00a0deputy who\u00a0had\u00a0accompanied him rendered his verdict:\u00a0\u201cWhoa, that\u00a0was gross.\u201d But if Menendez had been rebuffed, his subsequent actions suggested otherwise. Nadine told Uribe to meet Menendez at the senator\u2019s apartment building, where Menendez, per Uribe, told him, \u201cThat thing that you asked me about (last night), it doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there.\u201d For Uribe, who told the court he wanted all the probes \u201cstopped and killed,\u201d this registered as qualified good news. He texted an associate saying it had been a \u201cgood meeting\u201d and that Menendez felt \u201cvery positive.\u201d The \u201cpeace\u201d that Uribe craved, though, would not come until months later, when he testified that Menendez, called from his office on Capitol Hill with more definitive word. \u201cThat thing that you asked me about,\u201d he began again, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing there. I give you your peace.\u201d Days later, Uribe, a friend, the senator and Nadine gathered at an upscale North Jersey restaurant to celebrate \u2013 not their alleged deal, which never came up, but the future Menendezes\u2019 engagement. Jurors saw a picture of the foursome with champagne glasses in hand, sharing a toast after diners at another table had sent over a bottle. That might have been the end of the story, but the most sensational testimony had yet to come. After months apart, largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Uribe was again sitting for a meal with Bob Menendez and Nadine. This time, Nadine\u2019s adult daughter was also present. At some point, Menendez quietly texted Nadine, \u201cCan you go to (the) bathroom?\u201d Uribe was, once again, alone with Menendez. The senator, he testified, sat back in his chair, hands across his stomach, and spoke in Spanish. \u201cI saved your ass twice,\u201d Menendez said, according to Uribe. \u201cNot once, but twice.\u201d The Bob-father? Lovestruck naif or the all-knowing boss of a carefully managed alleged criminal network? The defense has often sought to portray Menendez as a victim of sorts, at worst an unwitting accomplice to his glamourous new girlfriend\u2019s corrupt machinations. Prosecutors, with Uribe as their star witness, have called that claim nonsense. Menendez \u201cused Nadine as his go-between to deliver messages to and from the people paying bribes,\u201d prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said in her opening statement, after telling the jury that the alleged episode \u201cwas not politics as usual,\u201d \u201cThis was politics for profit,\u201d she said, \u201ca US senator on the take.\u201d From there, the government has fought the perception, advanced by the defense, that Menendez had a limited view into Nadine\u2019s world \u2013 they even had separate phone plans, the defense noted \u2013 and could not have known what she was promising Uribe, Hana and others. Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman described his client as being smitten by Nadine, a \u201cbeautiful and tall, international woman,\u201d who entered his life as a romantic prospect shortly after another corruption case against Menendez was dropped following a mistrial. The defense also tried and failed to call a psychiatrist as a witness to testify that \u201cintergenerational trauma\u201d \u2013 in Menendez\u2019s case, Fidel Castro\u2019s seizure of power, and property, in communist Cuba \u2013 led the anxious senator to keep the now infamous bricks of cash in his home, stuffed in jackets, closets and boots. Prosecutors, through testimony from Uribe and, before him, a former senior official at the US Department of Agriculture, sought to rubbish the defense\u2019s suggestions. Ted McKinney, the undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, testified that in May 2019 Menendez told him to stop interfering with the workings of a mysterious new halal meat certification firm, based in New Jersey and owned by Hana, that suddenly became the sole Egyptian-sanctioned US operator. McKinney testified he understood what Menendez told him over the phone: \u201cto stand down and stop doing all of the things that we were doing\u201d to probe the arrangement. McKinney said he demurred but felt that Menendez was trying to inappropriately pressure him. Other prosecution witnesses, like Grewal, depicted Menendez in a similar way: cautious with his words, but plainly comfortable exercising his power in the form of pointed, informal conversations and inquiries into their work. Uribe delivered the most striking picture \u2013 of Menendez calling him from his Senate office to confirm he had delivered on Nadine\u2019s promise and then crowing about it at their dinner months later, suggesting it hadn\u2019t been that heavy a lift after all. The two Nadines Nadine Menendez, though absent from court, has loomed over nearly all the proceedings. The prosecution calls her the central conduit of cash, gifts \u2013 including the infamous Mercedes Benz convertible \u2013 and information traded among the defendants and other unindicted parties. But still, only that: a connector or \u201cgo-between.\u201d The defense, however, says that undersells her influence. Menendez\u2019s lawyers have accused her of hiding her financial troubles from her then-boyfriend and keeping him in the dark about key pieces of her negotiations with a rogues\u2019 gallery of local business operators. Her delayed trial is slated for August,\u00a0but for now, for her husband and his lawyers, she stands as the clearest buffer between the senator and a laundry list of alleged criminality. Through weeks of testimony, and most sharply over the past four days in court, it has been Nadine\u2019s text messages, with Uribe and others, driving the case. The jury will likely need to decide which version of Nadine they believe to be closest to the truth \u2013 a reckoning that will be intertwined with their perception of her husband. Unanswered questions Even after nearly five weeks, many of the crucial issues at the crux of the case remain either in doubt or are being fiercely contested. Uribe said he didn\u2019t know how the senator would have carried out a plan to try to obtain a more favorable outcome for an Uribe associate and then quash a wider investigation that threatened Uribe\u2019s close friends and relatives, as prosecutors have insisted. Testimony with insight into these matters has either focused on the \u201cbefore\u201d or the \u201cafter.\u201d The alleged crimes themselves, the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhen\u201d remain murky. Prosecutors will likely ask jurors to make simple, logical inferences using a combination of testimony and documentary evidence, like text messages, to come to what they\u2019ve suggested is a simple, logical conclusion. But with the defense aggressively seeking to undermine Uribe, who had an estimable rap sheet even before getting involved with Menendez, what appeared clear-cut at first glance is now at least a little murkier. Adam Fee, a lawyer for Menendez, drilled down hard from the beginning of his cross-examination. \u201cYou\u2019re a very good liar, aren\u2019t\u00a0you?,\u201d Fee said to Uribe, before questioning nearly every aspect of the businessman\u2019s testimony and suggesting Wednesday that Uribe\u2019s admitted use of Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication he was not prescribed, and alcohol made his memory \u2013 and so his testimony \u2013 wholly unreliable. (Uribe denied ever being intoxicated during meetings with Menendez.) Where do we go from here? With Uribe\u2019s excusal, the trial quickly pivoted to co-defendant Daibes, whom prosecutors say Menendez sought to help with a pending criminal case in 2020. He did so, the prosecution said, by trying to influence who would fill the role of US attorney for the District of New Jersey, a federal position. Philip Sellinger, who now holds the job but was a potential pick during a meeting with Menendez shortly after Joe Biden was elected president, told the court that Menendez had brought up Daibes\u2019 case during their sitdown. \u201cSen. Menendez mentioned that Fred Daibes had a case before the US attorney\u2019s office, and Sen. Menendez believed that he was being treated \u2013 he, Mr. Daibes \u2013 was being treated unfairly, and Sen. Menendez hoped that if I became US attorney that I would look at it carefully,\u201d\u00a0Sellinger testified Wednesday afternoon. After another conversation in which Sellinger says he told Menendez he might have to recuse himself from any case involving Daibes because of conflicts pre-dating 2020, the buzz quieted. Later, Sellinger testified, the senator informed him that he would not boost his bid for the US attorney position. \u201cHe told me that he was unable to have the White House nominate me and therefore he wasn\u2019t going to recommend it,\u201d Sellinger recalled. \u201cHe did not say specifically why.\u201d After the eventual nominee, Esther Suarez, fell out of favor, Sellinger said he spoke to Menendez again in the spring of 2021. A top aide to Menendez later called to \u201cfollow up\u201d on Sellinger\u2019s previous chats with the senator. By December, Sellinger had been nominated by the White House, confirmed by the Senate and sworn into his post. Menendez, he said, did not bring up Daibes again, but Sellinger was informed by the Justice Department shortly after taking office that while he could not participate in the case, his staff could continue working on it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_social-security-medicare-election-what-matters", "text": "Unlike most Republicans who have been critical of former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Paul Ryan is not about to make an endorsement or even indicate he\u2019ll grudgingly vote for Trump. Arguing Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d for office, Ryan, a Republican who represented the battleground state of Wisconsin in Congress, said on Fox News this week that he\u2019ll write in some other Republican \u2013 a conservative rather than a populist like Trump. It was a notable moment, particularly since it occurred on Fox News, where opposition to Trump is hard to come by. Ryan, who has turned to a lucrative career on Wall Street since leaving politics, remains on the board of the conservative network\u2019s parent company. \u201cI would prefer a party that is based on principles, not personality or populism,\u201d Ryan said, describing himself as \u201can anti-establishment Republican at this time.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning turn for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, to be so out of whack with his party. Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who selected Ryan as his running mate, is also now effectively a member of the shrinking Republican resistance to Trump. A promise to do nothing Like many Americans, Ryan said he isn\u2019t happy with either of the major-party candidates, but he has a very specific reason for concern. It\u2019s worth taking a closer look at his important point. \u201cThey\u2019re both promising not to tackle the debt,\u201d Ryan said, coming back to the issue that has animated his political career. \u201cAll the First World countries have the same issue we have: baby boomers retiring and unfunded entitlements coming due, and massive amount of debt,\u201d he said, referring to Social Security and Medicare, on which millions of aging Americans rely for their quality of life but which also eat up a growing portion of federal spending. For the record, both President Joe Biden and Trump have sworn they will not cut benefits. When Trump suggested in an interview in March that he might be open to Medicare and Social Security cuts, his campaign quickly made clear that no, he was talking about waste, not touching the programs themselves. He attacked other Republicans during the primary for being open to reforming these programs. $34 trillion and counting The current US national debt exceeds $34 trillion, a figure that has exploded under both parties. Pandemic-era spending had bipartisan support. Republicans passed massive tax cuts under Trump. Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act under Biden and the Affordable Care Act under then-President Barack Obama. Ryan is absolutely correct that neither side, at least at the presidential level, is making action on the debt a political priority. \u201cYou can fix it if you have the political will,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the political will right now. We don\u2019t have serious politics right now.\u201d Whether and exactly how concerned to be with that debt is a matter of intense debate among policy wonks and economists, but the idea that the US is on an unsustainable path is generally accepted. More focus on tax cuts Meanwhile, in the larger political conversation, there\u2019s more focus on how or whether to extend Trump-era tax cuts that will expire next year. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby has a look at the opposing promises from Biden and Trump. Trump wants to extend all of the tax cuts, which could further explode the debt without corresponding spending cuts. Biden, on the other hand, wants to allow the cuts to expire only for those making $400,000 and up. He would also try raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. When Trump and Republicans enacted the current tax structure, they made individual tax cuts temporary and most of the corporate tax cuts permanent. Democrats are also hoping to use the tax debate as leverage to increase social safety net spending. More from Luhby: Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced\u00a0child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous\u00a0Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the\u00a0American Rescue Plan Act\u00a0that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. Her story \u2013 read it here \u2013 outlines more of the looming tax implications and spells out the argument that the Trump tax cuts were a huge success alongside the opposing argument that they were a total failure. What\u2019s not up for debate is that the debt has grown, by trillions of dollars, under both Trump and Biden. Fearing \u2018radical budget surgery\u2019 Ryan fears a future when the Treasury Department can no longer sell the interest-bearing bonds that fund deficit spending, at which point the government would essentially have to print money to cover expenses. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a dollar crisis. That\u2019s when the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency is called into question. That\u2019s a huge privilege we could lose,\u201d he said, arguing it would lead to \u201cradical budget surgery\u201d \u2013 steep, painful cuts \u2013 to get out of the crisis. Solve the problem now or solve the problem later, he is arguing, but solving it now will be less painful. Tough choices could come sooner than you think Social Security won\u2019t be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035 unless Congress acts, according to a government forecast. Spending on the program will balloon, and the trust funds that currently fund it will run dry. At that point, the payroll tax and other income sources that fund Social Security will only be able to pay 83% of benefits. Congress will be forced to do something. It\u2019s a similar story with a slightly different timeline for Medicare. \u201cIf you step ahead of this problem, you can solve the insolvency of these entitlement programs without affecting anyone\u2019s benefits who are on them today,\u201d Ryan said. The broad strokes of what needs to be done are generally known and have been suggested by a variety of commissions, foundations and economic policy groups. The fixes could include incrementally raising the retirement age over the coming years and changing the funding structure for the systems to raise more money. Biden has proposed additional taxes on those making more than $400,000 to address Medicare\u2019s solvency, among other ideas, but does not have a detailed Social Security plan. Ryan has previously endorsed reform Ryan, to his credit, proposed some of the more revolutionary changes earlier in his career. When House Republicans passed versions of those plans, he paid a political price. They arguably contributed to his and Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. \u201cThe problem is, doing what I just said, you lay yourself out there for ridicule,\u201d Ryan said on Fox. \u201cYou lay yourself out there for political shots.\u201d He added: \u201cInvariably, the political demagoguery makes it look like you\u2019re taking something away from people. The dirty little secret in all of this is, Medicare and Social Security are going insolvent on their own. That means they go bankrupt. That means current seniors do get their benefits cut if we do nothing.\u201d But Ryan also deserves some blame He was House speaker, for instance, when Republicans passed those Trump tax cuts in 2017, which cut government income without addressing spending. Ryan suggested a fix to the problem now could be a commission set up to create a path to solvency and which would be able to force a vote in Congress. There are previous examples of such commissions, such as the one helmed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1983. Ryan actually sat on another one during the Obama administration. Chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, it was called the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and it sought a bipartisan menu of tough choices to deal with the unsustainable path it has been clear the US has been on for a long time. When it came time to endorse those proposals, however, Ryan voted no, helping kill the commission.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/social-security-medicare-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed over and over this year that Iran was so impoverished because of his policies as president that it did not provide any money to terror groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. \u201cIran was, as you know, they were broke. They weren\u2019t funding Hamas, and they weren\u2019t funding anything. They weren\u2019t funding Hezbollah,\u201d Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May interview with right-wing host Dan Bongino. In a June interview with Phil McGraw, the personality known as Dr. Phil, Trump\u00a0claimed Hamas would have never perpetrated its October attack on Israel if he had still been president, \u201cbecause Iran was broke and Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hamas and they weren\u2019t funding any of the terrorists \u2013 Hezbollah, all of them,\u00a0there\u2019s like 28 of them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hezbollah, Hamas or any other terror group during his presidency is false. Iran\u2019s funding for such groups\u00a0did\u00a0decline\u00a0in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his\u00a0sanctions\u00a0on Iran had a\u00a0major negative impact\u00a0on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN this week. Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah.\u00a0 Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups\u00a0(though it\u2019s\u00a0unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his\u00a0years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements. Pompeo said Iran continued to fund terror in 2020. Experts agree Research institutions in the US and Israel have reported that Iran\u2019s financial relationship with Hamas\u00a0actually\u00a0grew\u00a0stronger\u00a0in 2017, the first calendar year of Trump\u2019s presidency, after several years of frostiness related to divisions between Tehran and Hamas over the war in Syria. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in\u00a0late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d But\u00a0Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. \u201cSo you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically \u2013 continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,\u201d Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a\u00a0transcript posted on the State Department\u2019s website. Earlier that week, during a visit to Israel, Pompeo\u00a0told reporters\u00a0that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to limit the money the Iranian regime has available to inflict harm around the world \u201chas borne fruit, it has been successful,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay at it. There is still work to do on that file as well.\u201d He said, \u201cEven during this pandemic, the Iranians [are] using the ayatollahs\u2019, the regime\u2019s, resources to foment terror across the world\u00a0even when the people of Iran are struggling so mightily.\u201d Four experts told CNN this week that Iran\u2019s funding for Hezbollah and Hamas never vanished under Trump. \u201cIt absolutely did not and has not,\u201d said\u00a0Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cDefinitely it didn\u2019t stop. It decreased, yes,\u201d said\u00a0Hanin Ghaddar, senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cI would say it slowed down, but it never stopped entirely,\u201d said\u00a0Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group. \u201cIran has never ceased funding many of its core proxy groups\u201d such as Hezbollah, said\u00a0Phillip Smyth, who\u00a0studies Iran\u2019s proxies. \u201cThey are hyper-focused on continuing these relationships and proxy building efforts. However, sanctions do take a toll on some of their operations/abilities to build proxies.\u201d A funding cut, but funding continued Iran does not disclose how much money it gives to Hezbollah, Hamas and other foreign armed groups. Brian Hook, who served as the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran under Trump,\u00a0claimed\u00a0in 2019 that Iran \u201chas provided Hezbollah almost $700 million annually and gave more than $100 million a year to Palestinian terrorist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\u201d Hook\u00a0declined in June 2020\u00a0to publicly say how much less money Iran was spending on foreign activities than it had before Trump launched the pressure campaign, but he pointedly noted media reports about Iranian proxies receiving less than they had before.\u00a0Pompeo also\u00a0touted this reduction\u00a0in August 2020. In 2019, The Washington Post\u00a0published an in-depth report\u00a0explaining that, because Iran\u2019s financial situation had been worsened by Trump policy, Hezbollah had \u201cseen a sharp fall in its revenue and is being forced to make draconian cuts to its spending, according to Hezbollah officials, members and supporters.\u201d Reuters\u00a0published a report in 2020\u00a0about how Iran had slashed its payments to Shiite militia groups in Iraq because of the impact of the US sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Iran reduced its publicly disclosed military budget under Trump. The\u00a0Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which monitors countries\u2019 military spending,\u00a0reported\u00a0that Iranian military spending declined 20% between 2018 and 2020. Still, there\u2019s no doubt Iran\u2019s unspecified spending on foreign armed groups continued to some significant extent even after these cuts. The State Department\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0on international terrorism in 2020 made clear that Iranian support for terror entities endured in the last calendar year of Trump\u2019s term. \u201cIran continued to support acts of terrorism regionally and globally during 2020. Regionally, Iran supported proxies and partner groups in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, including Hizballah and Hamas,\u201d the report, released in 2021, said. \u201cSenior (al Qaeda) leaders continued to reside in Iran and facilitate terrorist operations from there. Globally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force remained the primary Iranian actors involved in supporting terrorist recruitment, financing, and plots across Europe, Africa, and Asia, and both Americas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Wade resigned from the case in March over allegations of an improper romantic relationship with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but said in an exclusive interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Source\u201d that he remains close friends with her. The question of whether a sitting US president can be forced to stand trial for state-level criminal charges has never been litigated. Wade said in the interview Wednesday that he expects prosecutors and defense attorneys will have to confront that unprecedented scenario if Trump wins the 2024 election. When asked if Trump can be put on trial in the Peach State during a second term, Wade said: \u201cI do believe that he can.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that it \u2026 it looks good to the rest of the world. But certainly I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything that would prevent that from happening,\u201d Wade said. He added: \u201cIf he wins the election, then certainly there are lawyers out there who will be charged with figuring out that issue, maneuvering around it.\u201d Wade\u2019s interview comes as the Georgia Court of Appeals has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Trump and his co-defendants until a panel of judges decides if Willis should be removed from the case. Trump, who has been seeking to push off legal issues until at least 2025, has been arguing that her affair with Wade should also disqualify her. The court\u2019s recent order pausing the case is the latest indication that a trial will not occur before the November presidential election. The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, though it could issue a ruling sooner. Willis in a new filing on Wednesday asked the state appeals court to dismiss the appeal of trial Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s original order due to a \u201clack of sufficient evidence.\u201d \u201cWith the case now docketed,\u00a0the State of Georgia, by and through Atlanta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Fani T. Willis, moves for the appeal to be dismissed as\u00a0improvidently granted due to the lack of sufficient evidence, based upon\u00a0the explicit factual findings of the trial court, to support reversal of the\u00a0order at issue,\u201d the filing from the district attorney\u2019s office states. Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead defense counsel in Georgia, called Willis\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal a \u201clast ditch effort.\u201d On Wednesday, Wade pushed back on criticism that his relationship with Willis was to blame for delaying Trump\u2019s trial. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my actions played a role at all,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI believe in the indictment. Certainly I would never have done anything that would have jeopardized that work. I do think the timing of the personal relationship I had was bad.\u201d \u201cThis prosecution has nothing to do with the voters and their opinion as to whether or not this indictment is proper or not proper. It has everything to do with the rule of law,\u201d he added. Trial court Judge Scott McAfee had previously ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped away, prompting his resignation. The decision from the judge came after he held several days of witness testimony and evidence over claims from defense attorneys that Wade and Willis had engaged in an improper relationship, which they alleged financially benefited the district attorney. McAfee, in his ruling, noted that \u201cGeorgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices \u2013 even repeatedly.\u201d Yet, the judge wrote in his decision that an \u201codor of mendacity remains\u201d over the circumstances of their relationship and that either Willis or Wade would have to leave the case. Wade announced his resignation shortly after the ruling.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_supreme-court-rejects-challenge-abortion-pill-mifepristone", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. The ruling is a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the court\u2019s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. The court ruled that the doctors and anti-abortion groups that had challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue. Though technical, the court\u2019s reasoning is important because it might encourage other mifepristone challenges in the future. \u201cWe recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. \u201cBut citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities \u2013 at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-regulation of others.\u201d The challenge to the drug had been vehemently opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, which warned that a ruling that second-guessed the regulations for mifepristone could open the door to legal challenges targeting all sorts of medications. Under the Constitution, Kavanaugh wrote, \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue.\u201d \u201cCitizens and doctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take their concerns to the Executive and Legislative Branches and seek greater regulatory or legislative restrictions on certain activities,\u201d he wrote. Much of Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion covered the various legal thresholds a plaintiff must reach to make it appropriate for courts to intervene in a dispute. Turning to the anti-abortion doctors and medical groups that sued the federal government over the current regulatory regime for the drug, Kavanaugh wrote that the plaintiffs suffered neither the monetary nor the physical injuries that could have established standing. He noted that federal law already protects individual health care providers who have objections to performing abortions for moral reasons. \u201cIn short, given the broad and comprehensive conscience protections guaranteed by federal law, the plaintiffs have not shown \u2013 and cannot show \u2013 that FDA\u2019s actions will cause them to suffer any conscience injury,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence to bring up other issues he had with the anti-abortion groups\u2019 standing claims. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department was \u201cgratified\u201d that the ruling \u201censures that mifepristone remains available for women across the country on the terms approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d  Danco, a mifepristone manufacturer that had intervened to also defend access to the drug, said it was \u201cpleased with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this incredibly important case.\u201d The ruling, Danco spokesperson Abigail Long said, \u201cmaintained the stability of the FDA drug approval process, which is based on the agency\u2019s expertise and on which patients, healthcare providers and the US pharmaceutical industry rely.\u201d \u201cThe decision also safeguards access to a drug that has decades of safe and effective use,\u201d Long said in the statement. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that brought the lawsuit on behalf of the anti-abortion doctors, said it was \u201cdisappointed\u00a0that the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the FDA\u2019s lawless removal of commonsense safety standards for abortion drug,\u201d while alluding to the fact that the legal fight over the rules could continue with other plaintiffs. Ingrid Skop, an anti-abortion OB-GYN and member of one of the medical groups suing the FDA, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing that the FDA was not held accountable today for its reckless decisions.\u201d Originated in Texas with Trump-appointed judge At the outset of the case, the anti-abortion doctors and medical organizations who challenged the FDA rules sought to pull mifepristone off the market entirely, arguing it was unsafe \u2013 a claim that has been refuted by mainstream medical organizations. That effort came against a backdrop of conservative state laws that severely limited abortion in much of the country. As those bans helped propel the demand for medication abortion,\u00a0mifepristone became a logical target for the anti-abortion movement. Medication abortions account for nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the US, according to some estimates. A\u00a0federal\u00a0judge in Texas nominated by former President Donald Trump, Matthew Kacsmaryk, sided with the anti-abortion groups, but his ruling never went into effect. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed part of that ruling, holding the drug\u2019s two-decade-old underlying approval would stand. But the appeals court sided with the doctors who challenged subsequent decisions by the agency that expanded access to the drug, including the ability to dispense it through the mail. None of those lower court rulings went into effect because the Supreme Court intervened last year and ordered that the status quo around mifepristone remain in place until the justices reviewed the case. The Supreme Court heard arguments in March. In the meantime, a group of GOP-led states intervened in the case at the trial judge-level, signaling that the legal fight over abortion pill access could continue even as the Supreme Court has rejected the lawsuit brought by the anti-abortion doctors. Steve\u00a0Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said that Thursday\u2019s ruling \u201cdoesn\u2019t cut off the possibility of future challenges to mifepristone,\u201d as he pointed to the efforts by those Republican states. \u201cBut the reasoning of the case should make those challenges less likely to succeed, because those plaintiffs (and others) will have a hard time showing that they were harmed by the FDA\u2019s actions,\u201d Vladeck said. The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 as part of a two-drug regimen to end a pregnancy. Over the course of two decades, the agency loosened restrictions it initially placed on the drug\u2019s use. In 2016, it allowed women to take the drug later into a pregnancy, to 10 from seven weeks\u00a0of\u00a0gestational age. It also permitted non-physicians, such as nurse practitioners, to prescribe it. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the FDA announced it would no longer enforce the in-person dispensing requirement. Last year, after the doctors\u2019 lawsuit was filed, the FDA formalized that decision, allowing the drug to be dispensed through the mail. Both the FDA and several medical groups, including the American Medical Association, told the Supreme Court that mifepristone is safe. But the doctors, many of whom\u00a0have long been associated with\u00a0the anti-abortion movement, claimed that they faced the risk of being forced to treat patients dealing with complications from the drug, such as heavier-than-expected bleeding. They claimed that triaging those women had a substantial impact on their practices. And some said they had been called on to perform post-medication abortion procedures they said violated their beliefs. At the Supreme Court hearing earlier this year, several justices\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including members of the conservative\u00a0bloc\u00a0\u2013\u00a0expressed doubt that the doctors had overcome a procedural threshold known as standing, which requires plaintiffs\u00a0to\u00a0show that they had been harmed by the government\u2019s actions. None of the doctors who submitted declarations to a lower court actually prescribe mifepristone and none pointed to an instance when they\u00a0were\u00a0personally required to complete an abortion for a patient who had complications after taking the drug. The lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it filed the lawsuit \u2013 allowing it to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to Kacsmaryk, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump. The Biden administration, along with a mifepristone manufacturer that intervened to defend the FDA, argued that since the anti-abortion doctors were not prescribing the drug, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for them to challenge the regulations. The decision landed in the middle of a presidential election that has already been heavily swayed by the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence. The 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ended the constitutional right to abortion that Roe established in 1973. The decision prompted conservative states to enact strict\u00a0limits\u00a0on the procedure, which prompted additional litigation and helped rally Democrats. President Joe Biden has repeatedly blasted the decision on the campaign trail this year. The mifepristone appeal was one of two abortion cases the high court was considering this month. The other deals with a strict ban on the procedure in Idaho. The Biden administration sued the state over that prohibition, arguing that a federal law requires hospitals that receive Medicare funding to provide stabilizing care in emergency rooms, including abortions, when the health of the pregnant woman is at stake.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_tax-cuts-expiring-trump-biden", "text": "Whoever wins the presidency in November will have some especially tough financial choices to make next year. More than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts \u2013 heralded by Republicans for spurring economic growth and largely decried by Democrats for disproportionately benefitting the rich \u2013 are set to expire at the end of 2025. Add in some corporate tax changes and interest, and the impact on the deficit swells to $4.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That means the parties whom voters select to control the White House and Congress next year will be particularly consequential. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential nominees, have already laid out general positions on how they\u2019d handle the lapsing provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of the signature achievements of Trump and the GOP-led Congress in his first term. Trump and Biden\u2019s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are scheduled to speak Thursday to business leaders at different venues, where they are expected to touch on tax provisions. In keeping with Biden\u2019s long-standing policy promises, the president has said that he would allow the income tax cuts for the rich to expire while protecting those who earn less than $400,000 annually from any tax hikes. Plus, he has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate that the TCJA put in place permanently \u2013 which, along with higher taxes on the wealthy, would help pay for extending tax cuts for most other Americans, he argues. \u201cDonald Trump was very proud of his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and biggest corporations and exploded the federal debt,\u201d Biden posted on X in April, citing the original 10-year cost estimate. \u201cThat tax cut is going to expire. If I\u2019m reelected, it\u2019s going to stay expired.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, has promised big tax cuts for people of all incomes, as well as for businesses. And he told a crowd of wealthy donors at a fundraising dinner in April that one of his core issues for a second term would be extending the law\u2019s sweeping array of tax cuts \u2013 a view echoed recently by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republicans. \u201cInstead of a Biden tax hike, I\u2019ll give you a Trump middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut,\u201d Trump said at a rally in New Jersey in May. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cut.\u201d Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the American Rescue Plan Act that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. But how Congress handles the TCJA\u2019s expiring tax provisions likely won\u2019t be that simple, experts say. There are many costly measures to contend with, and their fate will have big implications for both taxpayers and the federal budget. Another consideration: Will lawmakers agree to pay for at least part of any extensions through other measures? It\u2019s also possible that a deeply fractured Congress won\u2019t be able to come to a resolution, which could prompt lawmakers to kick the can down the road and temporarily extend the provisions \u2013 as they did in 2010 when the big tax cut packages passed during the George W. Bush administration were about to sunset. Most of those measures were made permanent in 2013. A multitude of tax cuts The TCJA contained a bevy of individual income and corporate tax reductions, making it one of the largest tax cut packages in US history. Unlike the individual income tax provisions, most of the corporate measures are permanent. Here are some of the key things the law did that lapse at the end of next year: In addition, the law temporarily created a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns. The deduction, which also expires at the end of 2025, allows these taxpayers to exclude up to 20% of their business income from their federal income tax. These so-called pass-through businesses include partnerships, such as those formed by lawyers, doctors or investors. Also, congressional Republicans included a handful of corporate tax increases in the TCJA to offset part of its cost \u2013 the largest of which ends businesses\u2019 ability to immediately deduct the cost of their US-based research. Instead, they have to write off the expense over five years. Some GOP lawmakers are trying to unwind those increases in exchange for augmenting the child tax credit, which Democrats have sought to do. But the bipartisan package is stalled in the Senate, with some in Congress arguing it should be part of the tax reform debate next year. What\u2019s not expiring are the law\u2019s main corporate tax measures, which include reducing the corporate rate from 35% to 21% and shifting to more of a territorial tax system for US multinational firms. Prior to the TCJA, American companies had to pay taxes on all their profits no matter where the income was earned, though they could defer the tax bill until they brought the money home \u2013 giving them the incentive to park the profits overseas. Now, these firms don\u2019t owe taxes on certain types of income repatriated from abroad. In addition, the law created a number of minimum taxes to prevent companies from avoiding taxes. While the TCJA reduced taxes for most people, the rich benefited far more than others. If the individual income tax provisions are extended, more than 60% of the benefits would go to those in the top 20% of income, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group. More than 40% of the benefits would go to those in the top 5%. Those making between $400,000 and $1 million would get an average tax cut of about $15,000, lifting their after-tax incomes by 3.1%, according to the center\u2019s estimates. Those who earn $1 million or more would enjoy an average tax cut of about $50,000, raising their after-tax incomes by 2.3%. Only about a quarter of those in the lowest income households would see their taxes reduced. Their tax cut would be $100, on average, which would bump up their after-tax incomes by 0.5%. Big implications for the federal budget Allowing the individual income tax cuts for the wealthy to expire would wallop a small but influential set of American taxpayers, but extending all the provisions would greatly increase the federal deficit. These two factors will complicate the conversations on Capitol Hill. The debate will come at a time when the nation\u2019s fiscal health is in the spotlight. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle \u2013 particularly Republicans \u2013 have repeatedly voiced concerns about the US deficit and debt levels. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the nation is on \u201can unsustainable fiscal path.\u201d And even before Congress addresses the expiring tax cuts, it will have to contend with the return of the federal debt ceiling in January, which is expected to spark more heated discussions over the size of the nation\u2019s budget. Extending the individual and estate tax provisions would add more than $3.4 trillion to the federal deficits over a decade, while addressing certain business tax changes could add about another $550 billion, according to the latest CBO estimate released last month. In addition, interest costs would rise by more than $600 billion. While Republicans often argue that tax cuts pay for themselves, the effects of the TCJA are a matter of debate. Complicating the analysis is the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, which temporarily threw the economy into a tailspin and prompted Congress to approve trillions of dollars in stimulus and relief spending, as well as the surge in inflation in recent years. The law\u2019s supporters say that it accelerated economic growth and business investment, spurred companies to bring profits back to the US and raised household incomes. They argue that it\u2019s crucial to extend or make permanent the expiring provisions or those gains will be lost. Tadd Fowler, treasurer and senior vice president for global taxes at Procter & Gamble, ticked off the impact of the TCJA on the multinational consumer goods manufacturer at a recent Tax Foundation event. Some 44% of the company\u2019s sales are now in the US, compared with 39% prior to the act, thanks to increased domestic investment that led to greater demand for its products. Procter & Gamble has made close to $6 billion in new manufacturing investments in the US and added more than 4,000 new jobs since the law\u2019s passage. It also repatriates nearly $7 billion a year, up from about $1 billion annually in the years immediately preceding the TCJA. \u201cWe\u2019re a great example of what can happen with pro-growth and competitive tax policies,\u201d Fowler said, noting the law has \u201cpromoted a healthy investment climate in the US and a system that levels the playing field for US companies relative to our global competitors.\u201d Opponents, meanwhile, contend that the rich benefited most from the law, and that there\u2019s little evidence that any economic rewards trickled down to other Americans. Some scoff at the Trump administration\u2019s promise that the tax cuts would boost household wages by $4,000. Instead, tax revenue as a share of the US economy has fallen compared with projections, contributing to deeper deficits, while stock buybacks skyrocketed, benefitting investors. \u201cMost Americans saw very little from TCJA,\u201d Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive policy group, said at a Politico event last month. \u201cThe benefits really, really skewed to the very, very wealthiest Americans.\u201d Also, the faster economic growth that could be spurred by extending the expiring provisions would only pay for between 1% to 14% of the cost of continuing the measures, according to a recent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget review of analyses from four organizations spanning the ideological spectrum and comments from the CBO\u2019s director. \u201cIt dramatically worsens a fiscal situation that\u2019s already headed in the wrong direction,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the committee. \u201cThe last thing we need is to cut out some of our biggest revenue sources.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/tax-cuts-expiring-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters", "text": "Theodore Roosevelt carefully crafted his image of rugged manliness. The wealthy heir became a Badlands cowboy and a volunteer Rough Rider and war hero. A populist and a reformer as president, Roosevelt enjoyed incredible popularity during his lifetime \u2013 and he nearly remade the American political system when, frustrated by the direction of the Republican Party after his presidency, he splintered off as a third-party candidate and nearly won election as a Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d in 1912. But that image is not complete, according to \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President,\u201d a new biography by Edward O\u2019Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, which is constructing a new Roosevelt library in the Badlands of North Dakota. O\u2019Keefe is also a former colleague at CNN. The book argues that the women in Roosevelt\u2019s life do not get the historical attention they deserve, something O\u2019Keefe proves with detailed research and engaging writing. I talked to O\u2019Keefe about the book and how Roosevelt and his definition of masculinity relate to today. Our conversation by phone, edited for length, is below: Notoriously masculine, but the product of unsung women WOLF: Your book is about the women behind the most notoriously masculine president. What were you trying to do here?  O\u2019KEEFE: \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d argues that the most masculine president in the American memory is actually the product of unsung and extraordinary women. Theodore Roosevelt is chiseled in marble on Mount Rushmore, and the myth is that everything he did in his incredibly successful personal and political life was the product of his own will. That is true, but it also isn\u2019t the full story. His two sisters, Bamie (Anna) and Conie (Corinne); his two wives, Alice and Edith; and his mother Mittie (Martha) were an integral part of his success, and their stories have been almost entirely lost to history. Frequently absent at times of emotional difficulty WOLF: That theme shines through \u2014 that these women propped up this most famous of American men. But much of his life is built around leaving them. He was not there when his first wife gave birth. He left his second wife, who was critically ill, to go off with the Rough Riders. He\u2019s on safari. He\u2019s in the Badlands. He\u2019s very absent. How do you reconcile that fact with the larger theme of the book? O\u2019KEEFE: I\u2019m so glad you noticed that. I had this fascinating conversation with Connie Roosevelt, who is the wife of Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy\u2019s great-grandson). The first time I met her in 2019, we were at a fundraiser for the National Parks Conservation Association, and I had just started to work on the research for what would become \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d And I said to Connie almost exactly as you\u2019re saying, that there is this pattern that Theodore Roosevelt is absent. He leaves in a lot of emotionally difficult circumstances. And she chuckled and said, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go hunting,\u201d which is a line that I do use in the book. Theodore Roosevelt, who is known for willing himself through physical pain \u2014 that resilience of a cowboy and a rancher would really wilt when it came to emotionally difficult circumstances. He basically abandoned his daughter for the better part of three years, offered to give his daughter to his sister and have Bamie, his elder sister, raise her. He later said of his exploits in Cuba that he would have left his wife\u2019s deathbed to be there, and that\u2019s not an exaggerated statement. I think that the women in his life understood that they needed to be the support system, especially emotionally, that he didn\u2019t always have the capacity to have. I think if there\u2019s one surprising thing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d in addition to the argument that TR is actually the product of women, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an incredibly emotional person, as much as he\u2019s caricatured in history. I love Robin Williams and the depiction in \u201cNight at the Museum,\u201d but that\u2019s a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt. It\u2019s easy to caricature him with the big smile and teeth and the hat and the cowboy, but he\u2019s a very sensitive, emotional person who feels very deeply. I think it\u2019s what allowed him to empathize with people. It\u2019s what allowed him to connect with people. That\u2019s all, by the way, a direct result of the influence of his mother, Mittie, who\u2019s been completely written off in history. How a wealthy person became a populist leader WOLF: The gender inequality of the day is a major takeaway from this book. But also the general inequality. Roosevelt was born into fabulous wealth. These are people that take monthslong trips to Europe when he\u2019s a child. He is never not wealthy. But then he escapes that perception to become this populist leader. When inequality is such a big issue today, how do you view his rise from that perspective? O\u2019KEEFE: Theodore Roosevelt is not a Horatio Alger story. He does not rise from humble beginnings to find his way to the upper echelons of power and wealth in America. Interestingly, the expectation in the Victorian and Gilded Age was that those with the greatest amount in society owed very little back to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, like his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, was considered a traitor to his class. It was very unusual for someone of his status and wealth to run for office. Politics was seen as a dirty business, something that the middle and lower classes, that the immigrant class would be interested in, because why would you need the power of the vote? You have wealth. You have influence. I think some of that is due to the influence of his parents, Mittie and Thee (Theodore Sr.), a Southerner and a Northerner, who were able to disagree without being disagreeable over one of the most contentious issues in American memory, the Civil War. He saw them come together as a family and be interested in the unity of their family as well as the country. He did have a noblesse oblige. He did feel that to whom much is given, much is required. And I think that experience out in the Badlands of North Dakota \u2014 where it didn\u2019t matter if you were wealthy; you were expected to work equally with the person alongside you. A horse in a roundup doesn\u2019t much care if you\u2019re from the East Side of Manhattan \u2014 you\u2019re either gonna survive and do the work or you\u2019re not gonna make it. Connecting Roosevelt to Biden WOLF: The most gripping part of the book is your description of the circumstances around his first wife dying in childbirth and his mother dying in the same house on the same day. I was trying to quantify that level of tragedy, and the first thing that popped to my mind was the current president, Joe Biden, who lost his wife and his daughter just after he was first elected to the Senate. I wonder if you also made that connection. O\u2019KEEFE: Absolutely. Loss which no one ever hopes to experience is often the crucible of an individual\u2019s life. In Theodore\u2019s circumstance, it was his mother, Mittie, after his father\u2019s death, that said, we need to live for the living, not for the dead \u2014 that you would dishonor the memory of those who are gone if you did not live a life of purpose. I think that\u2019s very similar to President Biden\u2019s circumstances, absolutely. You know, he took the seat in the Senate that then, of course, he held for 36 years, in part because it would be a dishonor to the memory of his wife and daughter if he didn\u2019t. Loss and happenstance, fate and serendipity play such an incredible role in American history. You have to look at these moments, these crucible moments, as the turning points of not just these individual political lives but how they intertwine with the fate of the nation. A new focus on 21st-century masculinity WOLF: There\u2019s been a rise recently, particularly on the American political right, of men trying to reassert masculinity. Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who wrote a book about Roosevelt, more recently has a book called \u201cManhood,\u201d for instance. What do you think Roosevelt would make of that trend? O\u2019KEEFE: It\u2019s exactly what he was experiencing at his time. When Roosevelt was born in 1858, there\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no airplanes, there\u2019s no submarines. He will be the first president to go up on an airplane, to ride a car, to travel abroad while president, to go in a submarine. Everything changes, right? The society is shifting from agrarian to industrial. The technology that is coming in this age is disrupting how people feel about their sense of self and connection and community. There\u2019s an immigration wave in the country that, in the view of many, is changing what the definition of what an American is, and there\u2019s a fierce debate about whether we\u2019re an isolationist country, or we\u2019re going to be a global power. Does any of this sound familiar? This all intersects with masculinity and gender roles, right? There are constant themes of masculinity. How to be a man. What does it mean to be a man. What do you have to physically do in order to show that you\u2019re a man. He\u2019ll project the quintessential ideal of manhood in society\u2019s expectations at the turn of the 20th century. But what I\u2019m showing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d is that he too had this incredible emotional, soft side \u2014 that it was women, who were constrained by the age, working with him to achieve his goals. To your question about what is happening now, people trying to understand gender roles, masculinity, manhood \u2014 instead of looking at it as a continuum, trying to sort of define it as one or the other, to me, it sounds very much like something I\u2019ve heard before, if you pay attention to history. The duality of Roosevelt in the killing of a dog WOLF: There\u2019s a moment in the book when Roosevelt has just had a falling-out with Edith, his childhood sweetheart, who would later become his second wife. He\u2019s riding his horse home and, in a moment of pique, shoots a neighbor\u2019s dog. As I was reading that passage, I immediately thought of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced serious backlash for writing in her memoir about shooting a family dog who was unruly. Obviously, the 19th century was a different time, but I wondered if you thought of Roosevelt when you read about Noem, a Dakota lawmaker. Is she not just living \u201cthe strenuous life?\u201d O\u2019KEEFE: There\u2019s a stark difference between a family pet, as described by the governor of South Dakota, and an animal running in the Oyster Bay woods (in New York) that was owned by a neighbor. But this is the duality of Theodore Roosevelt. If you go out to Sagamore Hill (Roosevelt\u2019s home), to this day, one of the most touching parts is the pet cemetery, where they\u2019ve got the graves of all the different, many beloved animals that they had. The Roosevelts had a menagerie, a veritable zoo at the White House \u2014 Josiah the badger and Emily Spinach, the snake whom Alice (his daughter, who was named for her mother) named because she didn\u2019t like her aunt, Emily, and she didn\u2019t like spinach, so her snake must be Emily Spinach; Algonquin, the pony who was taken up to the second floor of the White House. They had so many dogs in their home, both in Sagamore and in the White House, that the pet cemetery is filled with the names of these beloved family pets. So it\u2019s incongruous with Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s attitude about pets and animals, but yes, it is true that after he broke up with Edith, he was so angry that he did indeed shoot a dog on a horseback ride through the woods around Oyster Bay. An unusual parallel, perhaps, to today\u2019s stories.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The move comes more than two years after President Joe Biden signed an executive order allowing online passport renewals for US travelers. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last year that the department had halted a pilot online renewal platform \u201cto make sure that we can fine tune it and improve it before we roll it out in a bigger way.\u201d Access to the program will be available for a limited midday Eastern Time window each day and will close once it reaches the limit.

It would be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the Shore or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of Ashdod.\u00a0A final decision is not expected to be made until Friday, officials said. Earlier this month, the pier broke apart and sustained damage in heavy seas and had to be towed to Ashdod for repairs that took over a week. It was moved back to Gaza last week and resumed operations on Saturday but had to pause again due to heavy seas on Monday and Tuesday. To date, the pier has been\u00a0used to move\u00a0thousands of tons of aid into Gaza, officials have said. But the pier\u2019s ability to operate effectively is heavily dependent on favorable sea\u00a0conditions, CNN has previously reported, and officials said on Thursday that current forecasts indicate that the waters will be rough on Friday and into the weekend. Officials have told CNN that\u00a0sea conditions in the eastern Mediterranean will only worsen as fall and winter approach, raising questions about the pier\u2019s realistic lifespan. Meanwhile,\u00a0the World Food Programme\u2019s aid distribution operations at the pier have been suspended for days and aid has been piling up in the staging area on the beach in Gaza, officials said this week. WFP Director Cindy McCain announced on Sunday the organization was pausing its work there after the IDF operation in Gaza that rescued four hostages held by Hamas and left scores of Palestinian civilians dead, and prompted disinformation that the pier was used as part of that operation. The Pentagon acknowledged that there was some Israeli military activity \u201cnearby\u201d to the staging area for the pier but denied that the pier was used in the operation. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re paused because I\u2019m concerned about the safety of our people after the incidents yesterday,\u201d she told CBS on Sunday. The operations will remain paused pending a risk assessment, which is ongoing. A source familiar said the UN was already conducting a broader risk assessment in Gaza, then after what happened on Saturday with the IDF operations near the pier, they decided to add the specific risk assessment on the pier operations. Once the assessment is completed, it will go to the Department of Safety and Security and the humanitarian coordinator to make a decision on whether to resume operations at the pier. Humanitarian officials say while any assistance getting into the Gaza strip is useful, the pier is not a sustainable mode for doing so. The Israeli government for months refused to open additional land crossings for aid into Gaza, and only did so after immense pressure by the US government in recent months. Even with additional openings, major obstacles to distribution within the Gaza strip remain and humanitarian officials tell CNN that there is still not an effective deconfliction method to protect aid workers. \u201cA very expensive distraction,\u201d one humanitarian aid official said of the pier.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/us-military-gaza-pier-considers-temporary-dismantling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}

John Fetterman has a history of unsafe driving, The Washington Post reported Thursday, raising additional questions about the Pennsylvania Democrat\u2019s driving habits in the wake of a car crash he was involved in over the weekend. The incident on Sunday morning was described as a \u201cgarden variety car accident\u201d by Fetterman\u2019s office on Tuesday, with a spokesperson saying the senator and his wife Gisele, as well as the other driver involved, were transported to a local hospital \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d But a police report obtained by CNN said Fetterman was driving at a \u201chigh rate of speed, well over the posted speed limit,\u201d and that his 2021 Chevrolet Traverse had to be towed from the scene due to \u201cdisabling damage.\u201d Asked about the disparity between his office\u2019s response and the official report, Fetterman declined to comment to CNN on Thursday beyond a statement he gave the Post in which he pledged to drive more carefully in the future. Fetterman, according to the Post\u2019s report, has received two speeding tickets in Pennsylvania: one in 2016 and one in March, for which he was required by the state to complete a driver\u2019s improvement course, a person familiar with the matter told the Post. Citing anonymous sources with knowledge of staff discussions, the Post reported that Fetterman has a habit of using his phone to text and video call while driving.

The senator\u2019s spokesman told The Washington Post that the accounts of his driving were \u201cgossip and inaccurate.\u201d The crash occurred Sunday morning in Maryland, according to the police report. Fetterman\u2019s vehicle rear-ended a Chevrolet Impala, which was being driven by a 62-year-old woman. Both vehicles were towed.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_aclu-bidens-border-executive-action", "text": "The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Biden administration Wednesday over a sweeping executive action that largely shuts off asylum to migrants crossing the US southern border illegally. The executive action \u2013 which bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum, with some limited exceptions, when an average daily threshold is met \u2013 marked President Joe Biden\u2019s most dramatic move on the US-Mexico border. Moments after the measure was announced last week, the ACLU warned it would sue the administration. On Wednesday, the group filed the lawsuit in Washington, DC. The filing argues that the new rules violate US immigration law and the Administrative Procedure Act, which lays out the procedural steps agencies must go through in implementing certain policies. The lawsuit challenges rules restricting asylum for migrants crossing illegally, citing US law that states migrants can apply \u201cwhether or not\u201d they enter at a designated port of entry; the requirement to claim fear, instead of being asked by authorities; the heightened screening standard; and reducing time for attorney consultation. The complaint doesn\u2019t seek emergency relief at this point. The plaintiffs are two Texas-based organizations that work with immigrants: Las Americas and RAICES. \u201cThere is no legal daylight between this asylum ban and the Trump ban the courts struck down.\u00a0The law is flatly illegal, period,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney who is lead counsel in the lawsuit and argued the challenge to the Trump asylum ban. \u201cThis law will not deter desperate families from seeking refuge here. It is ill advised and will put lives at risk,\u201d he added. White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez in a statement responding to the lawsuit said the Biden administration \u201ctook these actions, within its authorities, because border encounters remain too high and after Congressional Republicans twice voted against a historic bipartisan border security agreement that would have provided critical resources, statutory changes, and additional personnel to the border.\u201d Senior administration officials anticipated, when previewing the executive action last week, that there\u2019d be legal challenges. \u201cI respectfully disagree with the ACLU,\u201d\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro\u00a0Mayorkas\u00a0told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz Sunday. \u201cI anticipate they will sue us. We stand by the legality of what we have done.\u201d Similar rules implemented under the Trump administration have been blocked by the courts. In 2018, Trump tried to use the same authority invoked by Biden \u2013 212f, which gives the president broad authority to implement immigration restrictions \u2013 to clamp down on border crossings. But ultimately, a federal appeals court ruled\u00a0that the authority conflicts with asylum law and the 212f authority doesn\u2019t override it. The case \u2013 known as East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump \u2013 served as an example of why the president is limited in his ability to shut down the border.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_trump-too-small", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a political activist\u2019s attempt to trademark the phrase \u201cTrump Too Small,\u201d saying the federal trademark office did not violate the First Amendment when it declined to register the mark. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion for a unanimous court. \u201cOur courts have long recognized that trademarks containing names may be restricted. And these name restrictions served established principles. This history and tradition is sufficient to conclude that the names clause \u2014 a content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, trademark restriction \u2014 is compatible with the First Amendment,\u201d Thomas wrote, referring to a provision of the federal trademark law at issue in the case. \u201cWe conclude that the names clause is of a piece with a common-law tradition regarding the trademarking of names,\u201d he added later. \u201cWe see no reason to disturb this longstanding tradition, which supports the restriction of the use of another\u2019s name in a trademark.\u201d The dispute can be traced back to a memorable squabble between then-candidate Donald Trump and Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio during the 2016 Republican presidential primary, in which the senator joked about the size of Trump\u2019s hands ahead of a debate and said, \u201cYou know what they say about men with small hands.\u201d Trump shot back during the debate, stretching his hands out for the audience to see and insisting Rubio\u2019s suggestion that \u201csomething else must be small\u201d was false. \u201cI guarantee you, there\u2019s no problem,\u201d Trump said at the time. A host of headlines ensued, including one from CNN that read, \u201cDonald Trump defends size of his penis,\u201d and another from Vanity Fair that said: \u201cDonald Trump Assures America He is Well-Endowed.\u201d Two years later, attorney Steve Elster sought to register \u201cTrump Too Small\u201d as a trademark for use on T-shirts. He said in his registration request that the proposed trademark aims to \u201cconvey that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive.\u201d \u201cThe mark criticizes Trump by using a double entendre, invoking a widely publicized exchange from a 2016 Republican primary debate in which Trump commented about his anatomy, while also expressing Elster\u2019s view about \u2018the smallness of Donald Trump\u2019s overall approach to governing as president of the United States,\u2019\u201d attorneys for Elster told the justices in court papers. Federal law bars people from registering a trademark of a name of a living person without their consent. The US Patent and Trademark Office refused registration because the use of the name \u201cTrump\u201d would be construed by the public as a reference to the former president. The question for the Supreme Court was whether the prohibition could be squared with the First Amendment.\u00a0Elster appealed to the USPTO\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which also refused registration. A federal appeals court, however, later held that the refusal violated Elster\u2019s First Amendment rights. Justices differ on reasoning Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a concurring opinion, said she agreed with the court\u2019s decision but not its reasoning. Thomas relied heavily on the nation\u2019s history and tradition with trademark law to settle the case. Barrett said it could have been dealt with based on the court\u2019s past precedent. \u201cThe government can reasonably determine that, on the whole, protecting marks that include another living person\u2019s name without consent risks undermining the goals of trademark,\u201d Barrett wrote, in an opinion that was joined in part by the court\u2019s liberal wing. The bar on trademarking someone else\u2019s name, she wrote, \u201cis therefore constitutional, both facially and as applied\u201d to this case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor similarly wrote in a concurrence joined by the court\u2019s other two liberals that she would have applied the court\u2019s First Amendment precedent to decide the case. She said she was \u201creluctant\u201d to go down the path chosen by Thomas and her other colleagues. The provision of federal trademark law upheld in the case, Sotomayor wrote, \u201cis constitutional because it is a viewpoint-neutral, reasonable limitation on a trademark\u2019s registration.\u201d At oral arguments, the justices seemed inclined to side with the trademark office, with several raising doubts that Elster\u2019s free speech rights had been trampled on by the agency. Nothing stopped Elster from making or selling the T-shirts. \u201cThe question is: Is this an infringement on speech? And the answer is no,\u201d Sotomayor said at one point. \u201cThere\u2019s no limitation on him selling it. So there\u2019s no traditional infringement.\u201d Thomas similarly posited that if Elster\u2019s \u201cargument is that somehow your speech is being impeded, I think it would be good to know precisely how it\u2019s being impeded or burdened.\u201d In two recent cases, the court bolstered First Amendment protections when it declined to back decisions by the USPTO to deny trademark registrations based on other parts of the Lanham Act. In 2017, the court ruled in favor of Simon Tam, an Asian-American musician and political activist who named his rock band \u201cThe Slants\u201d in an attempt to take back a term that once was directed as an insult. He sought to register the name with the trademark office but was turned away on the ground that it is disparaging to \u201cpersons of Asian descent.\u201d Two years later, the justices struck down a provision of the Lanham Act that prohibited the agency from registering \u201cimmoral\u201d or \u201cscandalous\u201d trademarks, clearing the way for a clothing designer to apply for a trademark for a clothing line called \u201cFUCT.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/trump-too-small/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_g-7-leaders-italy", "text": "When the Group of 7 posed for its ritual family photo Thursday on the rocky Adriatic coast of Italy, the image was not of leaders at the height of their political strength. Instead, nearly to a person, the leaders assembling at a luxury resort in Puglia find themselves weakened at home by elections, scandal or waning influence. Amid the olive trees and swimming pools, the anti-incumbent sentiments coursing through Western democracies are creating extraordinarily high stakes for global geopolitics. Rarely has the yearly gathering of the world\u2019s leading economies been so overshadowed by the political vulnerabilities of nearly all its members. It raises questions of how effective the \u201csteering committee of the free world,\u201d as US President Joe Biden\u2019s aides have labeled the G7, can actually be amid anger and discontent from their own populations. Coming less than a week after far-right parties dominated in European Parliamentary elections and ahead of critical votes in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, the G7 summit will occur amid nagging anxiety about a populist resurgence. At a state dinner held in Biden\u2019s honor at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris last week, French lawmakers mingling underneath crystal chandeliers spoke openly about their fears of a potential Donald Trump victory, according to an attendee. That was a day before France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron suffered steep losses to the far right, prompting him to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections. \u201cOne of the great things about the G7 is we\u2019re all democracies so the leaders here don\u2019t get to pick and choose how things go politically in their country, day in, day out,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday as the summit got underway. Sullivan said leaders facing political headwinds \u2013 be it Biden or his European counterparts \u2013 would continue to be \u201cfocused on the task at hand.\u201d \u201c(Biden\u2019s) goal is going to be to do as much as possible to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if we are closely aligned with our democratic allies and partners,\u201d he went on. Concerns about migration and the burden of defending Ukraine are part of what is driving the rightward shift. Those have been central issues for the G7 since Biden joined the group in 2021 and promise to again be the driving topic for this year\u2019s summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend and convene a joint news conference with Biden on Thursday. Leaders are under pressure to find ways of turning around the battlefield momentum after Russia seized the initiative amid delays in American support, for which Biden apologized to Zelensky last week. \u201cWe had trouble getting a bill that we had to pass that had the money in it from some of our very\u00a0conservative members\u00a0who were holding it up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we got it done, finally.\u201d Ahead of the summit, diplomats were finalizing plans to loan Ukraine tens of billions of dollars to rebuild its devastated infrastructure, financed by interest from frozen Russian assets. The somewhat convoluted plan, which took years for the Western allies to come to consensus on, was still being hashed out as Biden was flying to Italy. And the president was planning to present a new bilateral security pact with Ukraine, a deal that lays out a path for the US\u2019 long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations. Indeed, the specter of leadership change in the United States and beyond is the uneasy backdrop to this year\u2019s G7, lending a degree of urgency to their work. \u201cThis is not a normal G7,\u201d said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, pointing to the series of upcoming elections and the wider group invited to this year\u2019s summit. \u201cYou hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: if we can\u2019t get this done now, whether it\u2019s on China, whether it\u2019s on the assets, we may not have another chance. We don\u2019t know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\u201d Among the G7 leaders, it is the summit\u2019s host, right wing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who appears on the most stable political ground.\u00a0She emerged as the only European G7 leader bolstered by last week\u2019s European Parliament elections. In an attempt to broaden the G7 discussions, Meloni invited the leaders of India, Brazil, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to join the discussions this week \u2013 a nod to non-Western economies that are assuming greater and greater political weight as the G7 countries see their own share of global influence wane. Once a skeptic who publicly voiced his concerns about Meloni\u2019s brand of right-wing populism, Biden has instead found in his Italian counterpart a somewhat unlikely ally on Ukraine. She has bucked far-right leaders elsewhere as a staunch supporter of continued aid to Kyiv. Still, she and Biden diverge on a number of other topics. Meloni has drawn comparisons to Trump and addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022. Her party, Brothers of Italy, has post-fascist roots. \u201cI am proud that Italy will present itself to the G7, to Europe with the strongest government of all. This is something that has not happened in the past but is happening today, it is a satisfaction and also a great responsibility,\u201d Meloni said early on Monday following the EU elections, according to Reuters. The leaders of France and Germany are contending with very different sets of political circumstances. After a surge from the far right, Macron is now risking parliamentary elections in a few weeks that could badly damage his ability to govern over the remaining three years of his term. In Britain, Prime Minster Rishi Sunak has called for elections in July in which his party is expected to lose power for the first time in 14 years. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau \u2014 now the longest-serving leader in the G7 \u2014 is unpopular, with a general election required sometime next year. Japan\u2019s Fumio Kishida has been beset by a party corruption scandal that has caused his approval ratings to plummet. And Biden, who has spent his term heralding a revival of traditional alliances and a defense of the West, is running neck-and-neck with a rival who\u2019s been convicted of felonies and who Biden accuses of undermining democracy itself. Whether it is Trump at the G7 table next year or Biden is among the great unknowable questions hanging over the gathering. Few leaders who lived through it would welcome a return the animosity that marked the summits of that era, be it battles over climate on a cliffside in Sicily, haggling on trade in the forests of Quebec or an argument over readmitting Russia at a lighthouse in Biarritz. By the end of his term, Trump had begun questioning the utility of attending the gatherings at all, fed up with what he saw as an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/g-7-leaders-italy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-son-trial-analysis", "text": "It would be devastating for any parent to see a child convicted of a crime. To experience it as president before the eyes of the world, during one of the most contentious reelection campaigns in history, would be unfathomable. But that is the ordeal now confronting President Joe Biden after his only surviving son Hunter was found guilty on all counts in a trial in Delaware over his possession of a gun while being addicted to drugs. The jury delivered its verdict Tuesday less than two weeks after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump learned he had been convicted of all 34 counts in a hush money trial in New York. The double convictions represent a remarkable departure from traditional presidential campaigns. Never has a former president and presumptive major party nominee been convicted of a crime. Nor has the child of a sitting president. Both Hunter Biden and Trump pleaded not guilty. Biden\u2019s statement at the start of the trial \u2014 that \u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad\u201d \u2014 encapsulated the tension of his role as the titular head of the nation\u2019s justice system and the pain he would naturally endure from seeing a cherished son, who has dealt with addiction and worked hard to recover, go on trial in the middle of a media storm. Biden repeated that poignant line in a statement issued immediately after the verdict. And unlike former president Trump after his verdict, Biden accepted the jury\u2019s judgment and the integrity of the legal system. \u201cJill and\u00a0I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The Hunter Biden conviction is the latest cruel twist in the story of a family that has endured more tragedies than most could bear. The story of how the future president lost his first wife and infant daughter as a newly elected senator in the early 1970s and brought up his sons with his second wife, the current first lady, has become part of Biden\u2019s personal political mythology. Nearly a decade ago, Biden suffered the loss of his elder son Beau, who had brain cancer. The president\u2019s grief remains raw and often comes to the surface during public events. The trial of Hunter Biden is also occurring at a moment when the president is already under extreme pressure, amid an intensifying reelection campaign in which he is facing an opponent who he warns is bent on destroying American democracy. Biden\u2019s personal burden is, meanwhile, being exacerbated by the fact that at 81, he\u2019s the oldest president in history and opponents highlight every slip or senior moment to charge he\u2019s unfit for office. He just returned from Europe on Sunday, but heads back Wednesday for the G7 summit. And his critical first debate with Trump, on CNN on June 27, will provide the kind of test of his mental faculties and emotional fortitude to match anything any modern president seeking reelection has faced. Two vastly different cases thrust into the same political maelstrom The Hunter Biden and Trump cases are vastly different, as is the way the former and current first families have responded to the trials. For instance, there have been no daily rants by the president\u2019s son about a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d judge. Trump\u2019s conviction for falsifying financial records to cover up a payment to an adult film star, by contrast, prompted the ex-president to warn of retribution. He\u2019s also absurdly claimed he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident who compares to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela. In the latest stage of his legal morass, Trump sat through an online pre-sentencing meeting Monday that came two days after he used his Truth Social network to launch a fresh assault on the probity of the verdict he has vowed to appeal. \u201cThese are not legitimate trials; they are merely part of an illegal POLITICAL WITCH HUNT the likes of which our Country has never seen before!\u201d Trump wrote. The former president\u2019s sentencing has been set for July 11, just a few days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s sentencing is not expected to occur until October. Joe Biden, who has said he is trying to restore faith in the justice system after the Trump presidency, said in a solemn ABC News interview that he won\u2019t pardon his son. This is especially significant since Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, although a sentence for a first-time offender is unlikely to be that severe. First families in the spotlight While cameras were barred from the courtroom in both trials, each unfolded against a backdrop of taut political drama and the glare of publicity surrounding the former and current first families. The ex-president\u2019s adult sons Eric and Donald Jr. sometimes attended court in New York. And crowds of GOP lawmakers \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 were eager to embroider the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s claims that he was a victim of politicized justice in what amounts to an attack on the rule of law by a major American political party. Former first lady Melania Trump did not attend. Biden has stayed away from his son\u2019s trial in Wilmington, but first lady Jill Biden has led a gathering of the clan at the courthouse for the last week. She crossed the Atlantic four times last week, balancing her official role alongside her husband at D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations and in a state visit to France with her desire to be with her son in his hour of greatest need. In one striking moment in the trial\u2019s closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors drawn from a state where many families have a story about interacting with the Bidens that they should draw no inference from the first family\u2019s rock-solid bond and presence at the trial. \u201cPeople sitting in the gallery are not evidence. You may recognize them from the news \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d\u00a0Wise added: \u201cYour decision can only be made on evidence.\u201d The infringements on the Biden family\u2019s dignity and privacy cut deep during the trial, which saw discomforting testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s former cocaine addiction. Beau Biden\u2019s widow, Hallie, who had a relationship with Hunter as they grieved, testified about their joint cocaine use that she said now embarrasses and shames her. In a heart-rending scene, the accused\u2019s daughter, Naomi, was brought to the stand by the defense, then came under a rigorous cross-examination from prosecutors. The way addiction ravages loved ones as well as the user was laid bare when a text from Naomi to her father reading, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad, I can\u2019t take this,\u201d was introduced into evidence. Media organizations, meanwhile, played an excerpt from Hunter Biden\u2019s audio book that chronicles his spiral into addiction that was used in the prosecution case. Two politicized trials with critical differences Given the identities of those involved and the fraught national moment in the middle of a bitterly contested general election, there\u2019s no way the Trump and Hunter Biden trials could not have become politicized. Trump has claimed that he\u2019s the victim of a vendetta by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, though he was indicted by a grand jury, enjoyed the presumption of innocence like any other accused felon and was judged by a jury of his peers. When Biden\u2019s plea deal collapsed in the court of a Trump-appointed judge and when Attorney General Merrick Garland made David Weiss, the prosecutor investigating Biden, a special counsel, some Democrats asked whether Republican pressure designed to damage the president had weighed on the renewed push for a trial. But both trials have been conducted according to the rules of evidence and provided expansive protections for the accused. And the same bedrock American principle that was cited by prosecutors in the Trump hush money trial was used by Wise in his summation on Monday. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d he said, urging jurors not to treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d There is a critical difference between the two trials that debunks much of the political noise around them. Hunter Biden, unlike Trump, did not serve as president and has no chance of sitting in the Oval Office as commander in chief on January 20. While Biden is facing serious charges and will go on trial again in September in a separate tax case, his alleged offenses have nothing to do with the Constitution or threats to democracy. Trump\u2019s charges, however, focus on alleged mishandling of national security documents that he hoarded at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office. He has also been charged in two separate cases \u2014 one federal and one in Georgia \u2014 with the ultimate crime in a democracy: seeking to overturn the will of voters. The former president is waiting for a US Supreme Court ruling on his sweeping claims of immunity arising from the federal election interference case that, if the court rules his way and he wins a second term, could augur a presidency of almost no constraints that could verge on autocracy. The second distinction lies in the fact that Joe Biden\u2019s behavior is not an issue in the criminal cases against his son. And House Republicans have so far failed to find that the president benefited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals in nations like Ukraine and China while his father was vice president \u2014 even if the younger Biden\u2019s activity raises serious ethical questions.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_larry-hogan-trump-maryland-senate", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he \u201cwould like to see\u201d Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan win his election in November,\u00a0according to a Fox News reporter who interviewed Trump on Thursday. Trump spoke with the reporter in Washington, DC, amid meetings with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He told the reporter he wanted to see Hogan, a former Maryland GOP governor, defeat Democratic nominee Angela Alsobrooks, according to a social media post by the reporter. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him win. I think he has a good chance to win. \u2026 I know other people made some strong statements, but I can just say from my standpoint, I\u2019m about the party and I\u2019m about the country. And I would like to see him win,\u201d Trump said, according to Fox News. According to a clip of the interview aired by Fox News on Thursday, Trump was asked if he was endorsing Hogan. \u201cWell, nobody\u2019s asked me that, but essentially, I would be endorsing him, yeah,\u201d the former president said. In a statement reacting to Trump\u2019s endorsement, Michael Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said, \u201cGovernor Hogan has been clear he is not supporting President Trump just as he didn\u2019t in 2016 and 2020.\u201d Hogan and Alsobrooks are vying for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin. Democrats were expected to easily hold the seat in the deep-blue state, which last elected a Republican senator in 1980. But the entrance of Hogan, a popular two-term former governor, gave the race a jolt, and polling has shown him running competitively against Alsobrooks. Trump\u2019s reported comments come after Hogan urged Americans to \u201crespect the verdict\u201d in the former president\u2019s New York hush money trial shortly before it was delivered. Trump was subsequently found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The former president\u2019s allies reacted harshly to Hogan\u2019s statement. Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita responded in a\u00a0social media post: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with CNN shortly after the verdict, Republican National Committee co-chair and Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law\u00a0Lara Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Hogan \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve the respect\u201d of any Republicans and called the former governor\u2019s comments \u201cridiculous.\u201d Hogan, however, has continued to criticize the former president, telling CNN that a Trump versus Joe Biden matchup was a \u201cterrible choice\u201d and that he wouldn\u2019t vote for either man.\u00a0\u201cI know that sounds like a cop-out, but I just don\u2019t think either one of them should be president,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump loses this election, I think that will be the end of the movement. And I think we\u2019ll try to get the party steered back to a more Reaganesque, bigger-tent party that can win elections by appealing to a broader audience of people,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIf Trump wins, then, you know, we\u2019re going to see how long that movement will be successful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/larry-hogan-trump-maryland-senate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_starbucks-supreme-court-union", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with Starbucks in a labor dispute over seven employees who were fired after they attempted to unionize one of the coffee chain\u2019s stores in Memphis. The decision could make it harder for the National Labor Relations Board to temporarily halt what it views as unfair labor practices, including dismissing workers involved with organizing efforts. The NLRB is a federal agency charged with protecting workers\u2019 rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for the majority, which included all nine justices at least in part. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote an opinion partly concurring and partly dissenting. Thomas argued that the standard the National Labor Relations Board had sought would make it too easy for the government to win in every conflict with an employer. \u201cIn fact,\u201d Thomas wrote, \u201cit is hard to imagine how the Board could lose under the reasonable-cause test if courts deferentially ask only whether the Board offered a minimally plausible legal theory, while ignoring conflicting law or facts.\u201d Known as the \u201cMemphis 7,\u201d the employees at the center of the case became a nationwide symbol for labor supporters. But the legal question for the justices was a technical one: How deeply federal courts must review the allegations of a labor dispute before deciding to temporarily block a company\u2019s action. The case arrived at the court during a period of significantly more organizing and strike activities by the nation\u2019s unions. Some high-profile companies have complained that the NLRB is abusing its powers. During oral arguments in late April, the government argued federal law requires courts to give deference to the NLRB\u2019s read on such a dispute between employers and employees. But several of the justices \u2013 members of both the conservative and liberal wings \u2013 balked at that interpretation. At one point during the arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts quipped that the court could, \u201cdispose of this in a short opinion.\u201d In August 2022, a\u202ffederal judge agreed\u202fwith the NLRB, stating the Starbucks workers needed to be rehired. The Cincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit affirmed that decision last year and Starbucks appealed to the Supreme Court. The case landed at the high court amid a broader legal battle between employers and the NLRB. Several companies have been asking federal courts, often with conservative judges, to stop the agency from standing behind the more aggressive organization efforts.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_donald-trump-capitol-hill-republicans", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is back in\u00a0Washington for the first time since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee as well as a convicted felon, holding a pair of significant, closed-door meetings with key congressional allies, vice presidential hopefuls and even a few former outspoken opponents \u2013 all of whom are expected to line up behind him this fall. A bitter primary and general election cycle muddied by Trump\u2019s ongoing legal troubles have given Republicans little opportunity to sync up over the policies and proposals that generally drive an election year. \u201cHe\u2019ll come and lead the team,\u201d GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally,\u00a0told CNN. \u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\u201d Ahead of the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn noted it would be \u201cnice\u201d to \u201cget everybody singing from the same sheet of music.\u201d Cornyn has previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the GOP move in a different direction, before ultimately endorsing the former president in January. Senior campaign advisers said Trump was expected to express his campaign priorities and policies \u2014 focusing on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration during his meetings, first with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill club in the morning and then with Senate Republicans at the nearby National Republican Senatorial Committee building. He\u2019ll also reiterate his commitment to not cutting entitlement programs for seniors like Social\u00a0Security and Medicare. \u201cWe want to get everyone on the same page talking about policy, including the\u00a0economy and inflation,\u201d one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest factor in all the polling, it\u2019s the biggest thing people are worried about.\u201d Trump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss details around a potential second term agenda, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of lawmakers, if reelected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been eager for information to help them jumpstart legislative action on Capitol Hill next year. \u201cWe want to be part of that plan to hit the ground running,\u201d GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. \u201cWhen most presidents get elected, they anticipate they have eight years. This president knows he has four.\u201d Advisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity to allow lawmakers to ask questions or bring up any pressing matters ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to\u00a0open the floor to members after his remarks. House Majority Steve Scalise told CNN he\u2019s already talked to Trump directly about using a special budgetary tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate \u2013\u00a0 known as reconciliation \u2013 to advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington. Some of Trump\u2019s plans for a second term agenda have been outlined by the former President himself during rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but other elements have been only proposed vaguely or behind closed doors, and\u00a0leaked out by media outlets. Trump\u2019s reception among House and Senate Republicans is likely to vary Sen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, invited the full GOP conference to the Thursday event. However, some senators skeptical of Trump would not commit to attending. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, among a handful of GOP senators who have not endorsed Trump\u2019s 2024 election bid, are not attending, citing scheduling conflicts. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana wouldn\u2019t say if he was planning to attend, adding that he wasn\u2019t talking about Trump this week. Though Trump won\u2019t be inside the US Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his\u00a0first time meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021,\u00a0insurrection there, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell,\u00a0who has maintained an icy relationship\u00a0with the former president ever since the Capitol attack,\u00a0told CNN he will attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the electoral college certified Joe Biden\u2019s victory in December 2020, though McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this year. Any tension is likely to be balanced out by some of Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleaders and potential vice-presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance. Of those attending, many said they were looking for a more urgent focus, including Trump \u00a0laying\u00a0out a specific\u00a0strategy to beat President Joe Biden. \u201cI will be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little na\u00efve to me. That\u2019s like measuring the curtains,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. \u201cThis is about winning in November, and my guess is we may touch on the agenda next year, but that\u2019s a multi-variable equation not the least of which is how well we do here in Congress to take the gavels back.\u201d Others see it as an opportunity to try and reset the party after months of internal tensions over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiding the war in Ukraine and the divisions over the best strategy on border security. In the House, a chamber that has traditionally been friendlier to Trump, members said the former president\u00a0will find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, including some dressed to impress. \u201cI just think he wants to get everybody on the same page,\u201d said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little tension there in the Senate.\u00a0And so it\u2019s\u00a0just trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is Joe Biden and this administration, not each other.\u201d GOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he has several different Trump ties to choose from, though he complained that his gold, Trump-branded sneakers are back in Texas. \u201cHe will know that I support him 110%, and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure that he\u2019s the next president,\u201d Nehls said. Rep. Elise\u00a0Stefanik, who \u2013 as Republican conference chair \u2013 was in charge of organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is one of a short list of vice presidential hopefuls to receive vetting materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to attend Thursday. Trump\u2019s visit comes as House GOP leadership is facing increasing pressure from the right flank to go after the Justice Department and defend Trump in the wake of his hush money conviction in New York. One legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week \u2013 on the eve of Trump\u2019s Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction. One thing both House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stay on message. When asked if they believe Trump will discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and\u00a0while avoiding\u00a0airing his grievances, one GOP lawmaker told CNN, \u201cYou know the answer to that. It ain\u2019t in his DNA.\u201d \u201cWhat do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It\u2019s just totally unpredictable,\u201d said Sen.

Timothy Muller, 43, is charged with making interstate threats and influencing, impeding or retaliating against a federal official.\u00a0If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. While court documents do not name the FBI agent who was the target of\u00a0the\u00a0threats, a person familiar with the matter told CNN the agent is a member of special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team investigating the president\u2019s son. An attorney for Muller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has not yet entered a formal plea in court. The charges come as the Justice Department and federal agents report increased violent threats \u2013 many of which are related to high-profile investigations and prosecutions like that of Hunter Biden. Attorney General Merrick Garland lambasted the rise of \u201cbaseless, personal and dangerous\u201d threats in a \u00a0Washington Post op-ed\u00a0Tuesday, saying that department employees are being \u00a0\u201cthreatened for simply doing their jobs.\u201d Muller\u2019s alleged threats against the FBI\u00a0agent appear to fall into that category. According to court documents, Muller called the FBI\u00a0agent hours after a Delaware federal jury found President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter guilty of three felony gun charges. In a minute long voicemail, Muller allegedly threatened to kill the agent and their family, saying, \u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t f**king hide.\u201d The message continued with lies about the 2020 presidential election being stolen, according to court documents, and expletive-laden threats, saying that \u201cthe guns will come out, and we\u2019ll hunt you\u201d down \u201cand slaughter you like the traitorous dogs you are in your own f**king homes.\u201d Mueller then allegedly followed up in several texts to the agent\u2019s phone, writing, \u201cHow\u2019s the family? Safe?\u201d and using a homophobic slur, asking if they \u201creally think you were going to disenfranchise 75 million Americans and not die?

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_senate-ivf-bill-vote", "text": "Senate Republicans\u00a0voted Thursday\u00a0to block\u00a0a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide. The legislation failed to advance in a procedural vote by a tally of 48-47.\u00a0It needed 60 votes to advance.\u00a0Republicans criticized the Democrat-led legislation as\u00a0unnecessary overreach and a political show vote. \u201cWhy should we vote for a bill that fixes a non-existent problem? There\u2019s not a problem. There\u2019s no restrictions on IVF, nor should there be,\u201d Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, told reporters. The vote is part of a broader push by Senate Democrats to draw a contrast with Republicans over reproductive health care in the run up to the November elections. Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed Republicans who voted against the bill, saying that they are being \u201cpushed by the MAGA hard right.\u201d \u201cThese are the very same people who pushed to get rid of Roe in the Dobbs decision,\u201d Schumer told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d Thursday evening, referring to the blockbuster 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned a constitutional right to abortion. \u201cWe know what they\u2019re up to. They want to get rid of IVF, they\u2019re afraid to say it.\u201d Biden attacked Senate Republicans after the vote. \u201cOnce again, Senate Republicans refused to protect access to fertility treatments for women who are desperately trying to get pregnant,\u201d Biden said in a written statement. \u201cAnd just last week, Senate Republicans blocked nationwide protections for birth control. The disregard for a woman\u2019s right to make these decisions for herself and her family is outrageous and unacceptable.\u201d Republicans have criticized the Democrat-led legislation as\u00a0unnecessary overreach and a political show vote. The legislation the Senate will take up \u2013 the Right to IVF Act \u2013 would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to receive IVF treatment as well as for doctors to provide treatment, which would override any attempt at the state level to restrict access. The bill seeks to make IVF treatment more affordable by mandating coverage for fertility treatments under employer-sponsored insurance and certain public insurance plans. It would also expand coverage of fertility treatments, including IVF, under US military service members and veterans\u2019 health care. The IVF legislative package was introduced by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The vote comes after Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court said, in a first-of-its-kind ruling earlier this year, that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death \u2013 a decision that reproductive rights advocates warned could have a chilling effect on\u00a0infertility treatments. While the state\u2019s legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation. Southern Baptist delegates, for instance, expressed alarm Wednesday over the way in vitro fertilization is routinely being practiced, approving a resolution lamenting that the creation of surplus frozen embryos often results in \u201cdestruction of embryonic human life.\u201d The IVF vote is the latest move by Democrats to bring up a bill expected to be blocked by Republicans. Last week, Senate Republicans voted to block a Democrat-led bill that would guarantee access to contraception. Most Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that was unnecessary and overly broad, though GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill. Republicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception.\u00a0GOP Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas have introduced a bill called the IVF Protection Act\u00a0and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa has\u00a0put forward\u00a0a separate bill to promote access to contraception. Cruz and Britt attempted to pass their IVF legislation on the Senate floor Wednesday through a unanimous consent request, but Democrats blocked the effort. Murray, who objected to the request, criticized the GOP bill, arguing that states could \u201cenact burdensome and unnecessary requirements and create the kind of legal uncertainty and risk that would force clinics to once again close their doors.\u201d Under the IVF bill from Britt and Cruz, states would not be eligible for Medicaid funding if they prohibit access to IVF, but the legislation \u201cpermits states to implement health and safety standards regarding the practice of IVF,\u201d according to a press release.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_trump-closed-door-meeting-house-gop", "text": "Former President Donald Trump led House Republicans through a gripe-filled closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill\u00a0on Thursday,\u00a0airing grievances about his legal and electoral challenges, attacking his critics in the room, and only briefly addressing policy matters\u00a0like abortion and taxes,\u00a0according to multiple GOP lawmakers in the room. In his first time returning to the Capitol campus area since leaving office\u00a0after the January 6, 2021, riot, the former president met with lawmakers for over an hour. In between rants about Taylor Swift and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Trump went after his detractors \u2013 those who have since lost their seats and some who were in the room \u2013 as he warned\u00a0Republicans\u00a0to not be afraid of the hot button issue of\u00a0abortion. In a sign that the former president is reveling in how the party has fallen in line behind him, Trump bragged that\u00a0most of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him were no longer in office and singled out one of the remaining two GOP lawmakers left: GOP Rep. David Valadao of California. \u201cI never loved him,\u201d Trump said\u00a0of Valadao, according to a GOP member. As a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents. Trump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump\u2019s wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports,\u00a0to be nice to the speaker. \u201cHe\u2019s always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said \u2018are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?\u2019 He was joking. And I said \u2018eh,\u2019\u201d as she gestured with her hands. \u201cHe said \u2018OK be nice to him\u2019 and I nodded my head,\u201d she added. Johnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \u201ca very good job\u201d and that he plans to be \u201cfully prepared\u201d to implement Trump\u2019s plans if he wins in November. The former president\u2019s conviction\u00a0also\u00a0hung\u00a0heavy\u00a0over\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0meeting. Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict \u2013proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And\u00a0one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week \u2013 on the eve of Trump\u2019s Capitol Hill visit and two weeks\u00a0after his conviction. In his meeting with GOP lawmakers,\u00a0Trump\u00a0called the Department of Justice\u00a0\u201cdirty no good bastards,\u201d\u00a0according to another\u00a0source in the room. GOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the federal government being weaponized. In a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president\u2019s felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November. \u201cAnybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it\u2019s only given him even more energy,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cAnd what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they\u2019ve been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\u201d Trump tells GOP lawmakers to \u2018follow your own heart\u2019 on abortion Trump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Johnson relayed that Trump told the group to \u201cexercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\u201d Trump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions. \u201cHe talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\u201d GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \u201cAnd I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\u201d Trump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \u201cnot so good\u201d decisions. \u201cBut like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\u201d Trump said, according to a source in the room. Trump\u2019s message came as the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0rejected a lawsuit\u00a0challenging the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. The former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it. Trump off topic There were a number of moments where the former president went off topic. As Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee \u2013 where Republicans are holding their convention this summer \u2013 \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \u201cspecifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\u201d and not the city itself. In one bizarre moment,\u00a0Trump called Pelosi\u2019s daughter a \u201cwacko\u201d and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \u201cgreat romance\u201d in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room.. In response to Trump\u2019s comments, one of Pelosi\u2019s daughters\u00a0posted\u00a0on X: \u201cspeaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters \u2014 this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her \u2014 or the White House.\u201d He also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \u201cdope.\u201d \u201cWhy would she endorse this dope,\u201d Trump said, according to a member in the room. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to get off a stage.\u201d The former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \u201cNice guy \u2026 he even had a friend over for dinner.\u201d At the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room. Senate meeting striking a more unifying tone A few hours later, Trump met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors and \u2013 lawmakers said \u2013 struck a unifying tone. Senate Minority Leader Mitch\u00a0McConnell, who has had a distant and icy relationship with the former president and has not spoken directly to him since December 2020, said that he shook hands with Trump and that the meeting was positive. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you out of it that was negative,\u201d he said. Trump praised McConnell during the meeting, crediting the Kentucky Republican for his work to elect more GOP senators, according to a source in the room. The former president sat between McConnell and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who also has had a rocky relationship with the former president. \u201cHe is the choice of our voters overwhelmingly. It shows that he is absolutely the leader of the party,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said of Trump. \u201cI mean, you had people who have vociferously opposed him, who were sitting right next to him in the room.\u201d Trump himself praised a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Senate Republicans, saying there\u2019s \u201ctremendous unity\u201d in the GOP. Trump made a point of saying he\u2019ll stand behind GOP lawmakers in their own races, telling the senators beside him, \u201cYou\u2019re all either elected or you\u2019re going to be elected again and reelected, and I\u2019m with every one of you and you know that.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida characterized the meeting as \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d and providing the state of the former president\u2019s campaign. \u201cOptimism, but a lot of work to be done,\u201d Rubio said. Meanwhile,\u00a0Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the former president \u201cexpressed frustration\u201d over his recent conviction. \u201cHe expressed frustration over the recent trial, you can imagine, and justifiably in my view,\u201d Cornyn said. He said Trump did not bring up January 6. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-plane-ethics-supreme-court", "text": "Justice Clarence Thomas took several more trips on the private plane of GOP megadonor Harlan Crow than\u00a0were\u00a0previously known, a top Senate Democrat revealed Thursday. According to information obtained by Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, Thomas traveled on Crow\u2019s private jet during trips in 2017, 2019 and 2021 between various US states, as well as on a previously known\u00a02019 trip to Indonesia, during which Thomas also stayed on Crow\u2019s mega-yacht. The newly revealed private plane trips\u00a0add to the picture of luxury travel\u00a0enjoyed by Thomas and bankrolled by friends of the justice who have ties to conservative politics.  Thomas has come under fire for his failure to include such trips on financial disclosure forms the justices release each year, though he and his defenders argue that he followed the court\u2019s disclosure rules as they were understood at the time. The revelation was likely to add to the tension between the high court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have been pushing for more than a year for tighter ethics rules. A series of ethics scandals involving Thomas and, more recently, Justice Samuel Alito, have left public approval of the court at historic lows. Last year, amid stories\u00a0by\u00a0ProPublica\u00a0on the justice\u2019s jet-setting lifestyle,\u00a0the federal judiciary\u2019s policy-making body said\u00a0that\u00a0travel on private planes should be reported by the justices\u00a0closing a\u00a0loophole that Thomas said had exempted him from reporting the \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d he had received form his uber-wealthy friends. The court\u2019s critics argue that the current understanding of the disclosure rules\u00a0should apply\u00a0retroactively. Thomas, through a court spokeswoman,\u00a0did not respond to a CNN inquiry\u00a0about the new revelations and why the trips were not disclosed. He previously said that he was advised at the time that he was not required to disclose the hospitality he received from the Crows, but that he intended to follow the recent changes to the guidance going forward.\u00a0His defenders have pointed to a 2012 letter from the Judicial Conference, which administers the regulations for judges\u2019 financial disclosures, that cleared him of claims at the time that he should have been reporting his trips with Crow. Last week, with the release of his financial disclosures for 2023,\u00a0Thomas said\u00a0he had \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d from previous financial filings\u00a0a hotel stay paid by the\u00a0Crows during the 2019 trip to Indonesia and\u00a0his accommodations that same year at a private club they are members\u00a0of in Monte Rio, California. Yet he did not disclose his travel on Crow\u2019s private plane for\u00a0either\u00a0of\u00a0those trips that was revealed by Durbin. In addition to that trip, according to the documents released by\u00a0Durbin, Thomas traveled on Crow\u2019s plane from St. Louis to Montana and then on to Dallas in 2017;\u00a0on a 2019 round trip from\u00a0Washington, DC, to Savannah, Georgia; and on a 2021 round trip from Washington, DC, to San Jose, California. \u201cThe Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s ongoing investigation into the Supreme Court\u2019s ethical crisis\u00a0is producing new information - like what we\u2019ve revealed today - and\u00a0makes it crystal clear that the highest court needs an enforceable code of conduct, because its members continue to choose not to meet the moment,\u201d Durbin said in a statement that pointed to Supreme Court ethics legislation put forward by Senate Democrats. A procedural maneuver by Durbin on Wednesday to pass the bill on the Senate floor was blocked by Republicans. Elliot Berke, an attorney for Thomas, said the trips Senate Democrats called attention to on Thursday fell under the \u201chospitality exemption.\u201d Thomas and others have previously said they understood the disclosure rules to exclude situations involving \u201cpersonal hospitality.\u201d \u201cConsequently, and as Justice Thomas has already explained, he and many other federal judges were advised that they were not required to report gifts of personal hospitality from friends who did not have business before the Court,\u201d Berke told CNN. Mark Paoletta, a former top Trump administration official and prominent Thomas ally, similarly said on X that Thomas disclosed the hotel and private club stays from the previous trips because they were not covered under the personal hospitality exemption \u2013 even before the 2023 changes to the disclosure guidance. He argued that a justice\u2019s stays on a friend\u2019s \u201chome, planes\u201d and \u201cboats\u201d were exempted under the rules until the 2023 revision. Durbin and other Democrats launched probes into gifts and lavish travel Thomas\u00a0received after a bombshell ProPublica report that detailed the Indonesia trip with Crow \u2013 during which Thomas and his wife Ginni Thomas stayed on Crow\u2019s 162-foot yacht \u2013 and other extravagant trips that the Thomases took with Crow and Crow\u2019s wife. Crow \u2013 whom Thomas has described as among his family\u2019s \u201cdearest friends\u201d \u2013 has said that he has never talked\u00a0to Thomas about matters in front of the judiciary. \u201cMr. Crow reached an agreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide information responsive to its requests going back seven years,\u201d Crow spokesperson Michael Zona said of the information revealed Thursday. \u201cDespite his serious and continued concerns about the legality and necessity of the inquiry, Mr. Crow engaged in good faith negotiations with the Committee from the beginning\u00a0to resolve the matter. As a condition of this agreement, the Committee agreed to end its probe with respect to Mr. Crow,\u201d Zona added.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to try to depict Democrats as the \u201ctrue radicals\u201d on abortion policy. To make his case, though, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made wildly inaccurate claims. In a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump said, \u201cHard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born. Killing a person after birth is illegal in every state. \u201cEvery state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no basis for this claim,\u201d Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: \u201cThe falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.\u201d There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified \u201cother places.\u201d But he was wrong then, too: New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though false social media posts claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator\u2019s 2022 bill that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was revised before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee acknowledged that the early text\u2019s vague use of the phrase \u201cperinatal death\u201d might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom clarified that the \u201cperinatal death\u201d immunity is specifically for \u201cperinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.\u201d In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the false claim that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: \u201cI say, let the states decide. This is \u2014 every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN.  \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d Maya Manian, an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned,\u00a0said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_biden-campaign-trump-capitol-january-6-ad-buy", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is intensifying its focus on Donald Trump and his role in the January 6, 2021, riot, seizing on the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s Capitol Hill appearance Thursday to launch a new attack ad spotlighting the insurrection. The campaign recently announced Biden\u2019s endorsements from several January 6 police officers \u2014 who are stumping later this week in battleground Wisconsin \u2014 and now is unveiling a 30-second ad accusing Trump of inciting the Capitol attack. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more sacred than our Democracy, but Donald Trump\u2019s ready to burn it all down,\u201d a narrator says in the 30-second spot, which the president\u2019s reelection campaign said would air in battleground states during local news broadcasts on Thursday. The ad is part of an ongoing 7-figure ad buy in battleground states, a campaign official said. The spot coincides with Trump\u2019s planned visit to Capitol Hill for strategy sessions with House and Senate Republicans. Although he won\u2019t be inside the Capitol building, it is Trump\u2019s first time meeting with some key Republicans since the attack, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. Though Trump said during a rally that preceded the attack on January 6, 2021, that he was planning to march to the Capitol to join the rioters, he did not ultimately make the trip. Instead, he watched the events unfold on television from the White House. The ad is the latest attempt by the Biden team to harness the events of January 6 into an argument against Trump\u2019s leadership and what they view as his anti-democratic tendencies. The campaign this month enlisted three police officers who were in the US Capitol on January 6 to stump for Biden in battleground states. Two of them, Harry Dunn and Daniel Hodges, will be in Wisconsin on Thursday meeting local officials and holding a press conference to bolster their warnings about Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House. Recently, Biden has been telling audiences he believes Trump \u201csnapped\u201d after losing the 2020 election. \u201cThat\u2019s why January 6 happened.\u00a0Trump tried to challenge the election results on every legal avenue.\u00a0Over 60 court cases unanimously rejected his outrageous claims.\u00a0Trump failed in the courts, and he unleashed an insurrection,\u201d Biden told donors earlier this month. He\u2019s also tailored the message to Black voters, asking during an event in Philadelphia this month: \u201cWhat do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be talking about pardons.\u201d Biden advisers believe January 6 remains a resonant memory for voters and a reminder of the chaos Trump oversaw while in office. While issues like inflation and abortion remain atop voters\u2019 lists of priority issues, the president\u2019s team also sees preserving Democracy as a key motivator. January 6 has become one of the clearest points of contrast with Trump, who has promised to pardon those convicted of attacking the Capitol, called those imprisoned for their participation \u201cpatriots\u201d and sometimes plays a recording of riot defendants singing the National Anthem before his rallies. Trump faces legal charges for his role in the insurrection attempt, including a four-part indictment brought by special counsel Jack Smith involving a conspiracy to overturn the election results in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty and attacked the prosecution as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/biden-campaign-trump-capitol-january-6-ad-buy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_g7-ukraine-loan-agreement-announcement", "text": "Leaders representing the Group of Seven nations are set to announce as soon as Thursday an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, according to sources familiar with the discussions, providing a new source of revenue to a war-torn nation facing a steep and costly road to recovery. Negotiators had focused discussions on a loan amount of roughly $50 billion, a figure that would represent the annual proceeds on the investments \u2013 which generate profit of about EUR 3 billion per year \u2013 over the course of 10 years. The loan is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024, which would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. President Joe Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November\u2019s US presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine. Western nations froze Russia\u2019s assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount \u2013 roughly $3 billion \u2013 located in banks in the US. That led European officials to raise concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit, or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal. A senior US official says negotiators, who have continued working out final details in Brindisi, Italy, ahead of the G7 leaders\u2019 arrival, have structured the deal so that all countries participating share the risk. \u201cThis loan will mostly be provided by the United States and will be supplemented by money from Europe,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told journalists at a briefing. \u201cCountries are still discussing how to partition the cost if the profits from Russian assets are not sufficient to cover the need,\u201d the French source added. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing professional norms in Europe. \u201cThe $50 billion will be transferred before the end of 2024,\u201d the source said. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden to the summit that the discussions were moving toward a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of how the loan would be structured, though\u00a0multiple countries would participate and work out the technical details\u00a0after the summit. \u201cI believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use,\u201d Sullivan said. G7 countries began brainstorming ways to identify longer-term sources of funding for Ukraine in late 2023, as lawmakers delayed in greenlighting the White House\u2019s funding request. Amid doubts on future political and financial wherewithal to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine \u2013 and facing a calendar stacked with elections on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 officials began zeroing in on the Russian money gathering dust and interest payments in accounts around the world. Beginning in early 2023, working groups led by Treasury, State and the National Security Council officials held three, two-hour meetings each week beginning at 7 a.m. ET to accommodate time differences around the world. Banks and clearing houses that hold and process the funds raised concerns that simply taking the money would open up companies and countries alike to lawsuits and retribution from Russia. Utilizing the profits generated while Russia has no access to the money was conceived as a workaround that satisfied international legal concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between someone seizing your home and renting\u00a0out\u00a0your home,\u201d said Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance. The United States has provided $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion, a total that now surpasses the $171 billion in 2024 dollars that the US provided to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. The European Union has delivered $107 billion in aid. The World Bank estimates that Ukraine would need more than $500 billion to rebuild, a figure that climbs each day the war continues.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_hunter-biden-joe-biden", "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday offered his first public remarks about his son Hunter\u2019s conviction on federal gun charges earlier this week, telling reporters in Italy he is \u201cproud\u201d of him and accepts the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud of my son Hunter. He has overcome an addiction, he\u2019s one of the brightest, most decent men I know,\u201d Biden said during a news conference on the margins of the G7 summit. \u201cI am satisfied that I\u2019m not going to do anything \u2014 I said I\u2019d abide by the jury decision. I will do that. And I will not pardon him,\u201d he added. Hunter Biden was found guilty on three federal charges this week, punctuating an emotionally tumultuous trial that unearthed many dark and private moments for the Biden family. Biden reaffirmed that he would not pardon his son, echoing a commitment he made last week, before he was convicted in his gun case. The president also went a step further Thursday, saying he would not consider commuting his son\u2019s sentence. Presidents have the power both pardon and commute, or reduce, sentences in federal cases. Hunter Biden has not yet been sentenced in his gun case, and it likely will not happen for another couple of months. White House officials suspected the president may face questions from reporters at Thursday\u2019s press conference regarding his son\u2019s conviction, including whether the president would commute the sentence, a senior White House official told CNN. Biden aides suspected there was a good chance the president would be asked to comment on the verdict, the official said, and they were sensitive to the fact that White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\u2019s response to a question the day before had inadvertently created fresh headlines that the White House would not rule out the possibility of a commutation. But the official told CNN that Jean-Pierre\u2019s response had simply been a reflection of the fact that some aides had not discussed that matter with the president. The president has sought to draw a distinction between his own acceptance of the jury\u2019s verdict and rival Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his own legal issues amount to a \u201crigged\u201d justice system. To that end, he has largely chosen to stay quiet about his son\u2019s criminal trial. Last week, the president in a statement noted that while he is the commander-in-chief, he is also a father. He repeated those sentiments in a statement after his son\u2019s conviction on Tuesday. While Biden has largely shied away from talking about his son\u2019s criminal case in an effort to avoid looking like he is putting his thumb on the scale, other family members had shown up to support Hunter Biden in court. First lady Dr. Jill Biden was in the courtroom for most of the trial, making several transatlantic flights to be by Hunter Biden\u2019s side while the first family was in France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. The president\u2019s siblings, Valerie and James, also appeared in court to support Hunter Biden. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin", "text": "President Joe Biden is leading the world\u2019s richest democracies in sending a beefed-up message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West will not forsake Ukraine despite political shocks casting doubts over its commitment. Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago. \u201cWe will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,\u201d Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. \u201cUkraine\u2019s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. \u2026\u00a0The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president\u2019s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe\u2019s security. And the \u201cautocrats of the world\u201d name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House. Biden\u2019s emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy. But uncertainty over the West\u2019s long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It\u2019s fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky. In the United States, Trump \u2013 who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe\u2019s security given his endless attacks on NATO \u2013 may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend \u2013 especially in powerhouses France and Germany \u2013 could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin\u2019s willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does. But a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine\u2019s Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America\u2019s fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November. A flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine Still, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent. \u2014Biden\u2019s return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House\u2019s priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries. \u2014As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin\u2019s war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. \u201cRussia today has become a war economy,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. \u201cEvery day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.\u201d \u2014Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine\u2019s armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we\u2019ll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power. \u2014US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit \u2013 which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada \u2013 will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets. \u2014These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky\u2019s elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance. Russian advances on the battlefield These are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured. The latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites \u201ca worrisome trend\u201d of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Relentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv\u2019s electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon. Russian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe\u2019s territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war. \u201cThe Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,\u201d Clark said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Technically, they\u2019re pretty smart. They\u2019ve got China behind them; they\u2019ve got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later. An inspiring war turns into a bitter slog An extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes. At times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky\u2019s interactions with the West. The Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package \u2013 a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up. Biden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan. Not surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden\u2019s core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president\u2019s critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to \u201ctake bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom.\u201d But there\u2019s a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts", "text": "An unprecedented two weeks of legal drama that yielded historic convictions of a former president and a sitting president\u2019s son have also produced a clear political takeaway. The survival of the rule of law in America and untainted justice may depend on the choice voters make in November. The country\u2019s divergent possible paths under President Joe Biden or presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump were highlighted in the way both men, their families and their political operations reacted to the twin trials and verdicts. Biden made no effort to interfere in the prosecution of his son Hunter with either his executive authority or with the media megaphone of his office. He allowed his own Justice Department to secure a guilty verdict Tuesday that could result in jail time for the recovering addict and hurt his own 2024 campaign. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president said after the jury found his son guilty of lying on a federal background check form and possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. He has already said he won\u2019t pardon his son. In his first reaction to the verdict, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t attack the judge or prosecutors, simply saying he was grateful for the love and support of his family and blessed to be clean again. The Bidens\u2019 comportment contrasted with Trump\u2019s reaction to his own trial and conviction nearly two weeks ago in his hush money case. The ex-president lashed out at witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and the judge. He claimed that \u201cthis was done by (the) Biden administration in order to wound or hurt a political opponent.\u201d He blasted \u201ca rigged decision,\u201d despite the fact the Justice Department was not involved in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney. Since then, Trump has been warning he\u2019d use presidential powers to punish his political opponents and bend the legal system to his will. \u201cSometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump told TV psychologist Phil McGraw last week. \u201cI have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d The former president told Fox News last week, \u201cI would have every right to go after them,\u201d referring to the Bidens. Two Trump claims discredited by Hunter Biden verdict Throughout his trial in Manhattan, his former hometown, Trump, insisted he couldn\u2019t get a fair verdict in a city that votes mostly Democratic. But Delaware is a blue state \u2014 and a jury there just convicted the president\u2019s son. One juror told CNN Tuesday that politics never came up in the deliberations. Jurors in Trump\u2019s trial have yet to speak, perhaps because of fears they could be identified following the ex-president\u2019s intimidation tactics. Had Biden been acquitted, Republicans would surely have argued that a biased jury in a state where everyone seems to know the first family had proven their point. But the guilty verdict blew another of their political arguments out of the water. Joe Biden came to office pledging to restore the independence of the Justice Department following Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to employ its legal and investigative powers almost as a personal law firm during his term. But the former president has left no doubt that he\u2019d do the same and more if he wins back the White House in November and would ignore the DOJ\u2019s core mission statement of enforcing the law with \u201cindependence and Impartiality.\u201d Trump has already vowed to prosecute Biden and his family and to \u201cobliterate\u201d what he calls the \u201cDeep State.\u201d Several outside groups have drawn up plans to help him. The Hunter Biden verdict also contradicted the central rationale of Trump\u2019s multiple legal defenses in his four criminal cases, several civil matters and his entire presidential campaign. This is the false notion that he is a victim of a weaponized legal system by a Justice Department that exclusively targets Republicans. \u201cSo much for the weaponization of the Justice Department to go after just the enemies of the other side,\u201d Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official and federal prosecutor, said on CNN Max on Tuesday. \u201cThis is testament to the fact the Justice Department under (Attorney General Merrick) Garland is trying its very best to steer straight down the middle as it should and bring people to trial that it thinks are worthy of prosecution.\u201d The notion of Justice Department neutrality was bolstered by post-trial comments from David Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware whom Garland elevated to  special counsel to avoid the impression of political bias. Weiss thanked the attorney general for allowing him to act independently. And, he added, in a coda to two fraught weeks that have dragged the justice system into toxic political waters, that \u201cno one in this country is above the law. Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant.\u201d However, Weiss added: \u201cHunter Biden should be no more accountable than any other citizen convicted of this same conduct.\u201d Ken Buck, a former Republican member of Congress, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that Joe Biden had handled the painful matter of his son\u2019s trial and conviction appropriately. \u201c(He did) a great job in trying to stay above the fray and recognizing that his Justice Department was in a very difficult position. People look at this case and realize it was done in an independent and fair way.\u201d Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor and CNN political analyst, said the criminal convictions of Trump and Hunter Biden reflected the huge stakes in November\u2019s election. \u201cNot only is (Joe Biden) saying, the decision is also one that comes from the courts, he\u2019s not saying he\u2019s going to use presidential power to somehow issue a pardon. And you contrast that with the former president who\u2019s attacked the legal system. He\u2019s questioned its legitimacy.\u201d Zelizer added: \u201cVoters will have to make a choice. What kind of response do they want? And what kind of person do they want in the Oval Office come January of 2025?\u201d The idea that the Justice Department is only going after Republicans is not just belied by the Hunter Biden conviction in the gun case and a looming tax trial that awaits him in September. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey is on trial in New York for bribery and corruption. The Justice Department in May indicted another well-known Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, and his wife for allegedly accepting around $600,000 from Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil firm and a Mexican bank in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress. Both Democrats have maintained their innocence. Nevertheless, House Republicans are scheduled to hold a vote on Wednesday on holding Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of President  Biden\u2019s interviews with former special\u00a0counsel Robert Hur. Biden has asserted executive privilege over the files. The truth is unlikely to change the GOP Biden narrative Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin highlighted the contrast between Trump and Biden. \u201cThe Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don\u2019t like the way one case came out. Whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don\u2019t hear a single Democrat crying foul,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. Yet one lesson of the Trump-era is that the truth rarely matters. The revealing of inconvenient facts never penetrates the echo chamber that dominates Republican politics and conservative media. So rather than being chastened by the collapse of the Trump persecution narrative and the successful application of the rule of law in a criminal trial, Trump supporters in Congress merely used the Biden verdict to conjure a new round of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. House Oversight Chairman James Comer said the Delaware trial was \u201ca step toward accountability.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican warned that Justice Department officials were continuing to \u201ccover for the Big Guy, Joe Biden.\u201d Comer repeated accusations that the president had profited from his son\u2019s ethically questionable business operations in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president despite the failure of his committee and the House GOP impeachment probe to find any such evidence. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach. \u201cWe will continue to demand accountability for the corrupt business dealings of the Biden family,\u201d said the Louisiana Republican, a firm supporter of Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s loss in a recent civil case that found that he, his adult sons and his organization had committed massive insurance and banking fraud. Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former White House domestic policy adviser, argued that the Justice Department had actually shown favoritism toward Hunter Biden by not charging him with 50 felonies over foreign influence peddling. The department should \u201ctell him his only way out of life in prison is to testify against the BIG GUY,\u201d Miller said on X. Some of the GOP reaction to Biden becoming a convicted felon was bizarre. One of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, baselessly suggested on X that a verdict produced by a jury of his peers was some kind of elaborate plot. \u201cHunter Biden just became the Deep State\u2019s sacrificial lamb to show that Justice is \u2018balanced\u2019 while the other Biden crimes remain ignored,\u201d she wrote on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "politics"}}
