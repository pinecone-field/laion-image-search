Citing photographs and interviews with neighbors, the Times reports that the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag was seen on display at his property last summer. The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for supporters of former President Donald Trump. The flag is white and includes a green evergreen tree and the words \u201cAn Appeal to Heaven\u201d at the top. Alito and the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s the second revelation in as many weeks about a controversial display outside Alito\u2019s property. The New York Times last week published a photograph of an inverted American flag raised at Alito\u2019s home in Virginia in 2021.\u00a0Alito said the upside-down US flag was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors. The episode has drawn fire from critics, including\u00a0Democrats and\u00a0key GOP senators,\u00a0who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Like the inverted US flag, the Appeal to Heaven flag \u2013 also known as the Pine Tree flag \u2013 was seen during the attack on the Capitol. House Speaker Mike Johnson faced blowback for displaying the same flag outside his office last year before assuming the leadership post. The Appeal to Heaven flag remains outside his office as of Wednesday. Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s George Washington\u2019s flag.\u00a0It goes back to the founder\u2019s era. I\u2019ve always flown that flag.\u201d \u201cIt has nothing to do with that,\u201d Johnson said, referring to \u201cstop the steal\u201d protests. The Alitos\u2019 choice of flags are gaining attention in part because several high-profile cases are currently pending before the high court involving the election and subsequent attack on the US Capitol, including the blockbuster question of whether Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. Another case deals with a January 6 defendant who is challenging an obstruction charge filed by federal prosecutors for his role in the attack.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_fani-willis-scott-mcafee-georgia-elections", "text": "Two key figures in former President Donald Trump\u2019s election interference trial in Georgia\u00a0fended off challengers in their elections Tuesday. Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who is prosecuting Trump, won her Democratic primary rematch with attorney and author Christian Wise Smith. And Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the former president\u2019s case, triumphed in his nonpartisan election for Fulton County Superior Court. The 2020 election interference case in Georgia was sidetracked for months over whether Willis should be disqualified\u00a0following revelations that she\u00a0had a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade.\u00a0Willis has managed to stay\u00a0on, while\u00a0Wade\u00a0stepped down in March. An appeals court has said it will revisit the question of whether Willis should have been removed from the case. That has left the Trump case\u00a0effectively at a standstill.\u00a0A legal argument before the Supreme Court over whether\u00a0the former president\u00a0has immunity from prosecution also remains an issue in the Georgia case and may not be decided until this summer. Wise Smith, Willis\u2019 primary opponent, finished third in the 2020 Democratic primary for Fulton County district attorney. In this year\u2019s campaign, he questioned the resources that Willis\u2019 office was devoting to Trump\u2019s prosecution. Wise Smith said in a March interview with CNN\u2019s Laura Coates that it was \u201cvery unfortunate that her personal life has become so public. And you know, I feel for her in that sense.\u201d Willis will next face Republican attorney\u00a0Courtney Kramer,\u00a0who worked in\u00a0the\u00a0White House counsel\u2019s office under Trump.\u00a0Kramer, who was unopposed in the Republican primary, will be the heavy underdog against Willis in\u00a0deep-blue Fulton County, which is home to most of Atlanta.\u00a0Trump won 26% of the vote in the county in 2020, compared with Joe Biden\u2019s 73%. McAfee, meanwhile, faced criminal defense lawyer and talk radio host Robert Patillo in his nonpartisan general election Tuesday. Patillo, who describes himself as a \u201cconservative Democrat,\u201d\u00a0had criticized McAfee\u2019s handling of the decision not to remove Willis from the prosecution when details of her romantic relationship with Wade emerged. Another contender,\u00a0Tiffani Johnson, had filed to take on McAfee but was disqualified after she did not appear at a hearing challenging her eligibility. Tuesday\u2019s election was the first for McAfee, who was appointed to his job by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in December 2022 to fill a retirement vacancy. Campaigning in Atlanta on Tuesday, McAfee told CNN he had \u201creally enjoyed kind of being out there on the trail.\u201d \u201cUsually, we are in this legal bubble, where you are just talking to lawyers, and it is a healthy thing to get out there talking to some other folks,\u201d he said. McAfee also spoke of wanting to further voters\u2019 trust in institutions. \u201cIn my little corner of the world, if I can do everything I can to instill that trust, to further that trust, that is what I try to do,\u201d the judge said. McAfee had a major fundraising advantage in his race, in part due to bipartisan support from influential figures.\u00a0Kemp and former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, were the marquee guests at a recent fundraising event for McAfee. Kemp could wind up being a witness in the Trump case. And Barnes was already a witness in the Willis disqualification issue. Incumbent Georgia Supreme Court justice wins six-year term Georgia Supreme Court Justice Andrew Pinson\u00a0won a six-year term, defeating an opponent\u00a0who made abortion rights a central part of his campaign. Though elections for Georgia\u2019s\u00a0highest\u00a0court are\u00a0nonpartisan,\u00a0Pinson and his challenger, former US Rep. John Barrow, came from partisan backgrounds.\u00a0Pinson \u2013 a former clerk for US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas \u2013 was appointed\u00a0to his current position\u00a0in 2022\u00a0by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.\u00a0The governor\u2019s\u00a0leadership\u00a0committee\u00a0Georgians First\u00a0spent more than $600,000\u00a0to boost\u00a0the justice\u2019s\u00a0campaign\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in\u00a0an ad, Kemp described Pinson as the \u201cconservative voice we can trust.\u201d\u00a0Barrow, meanwhile, spent a decade as a Democratic congressman representing parts of eastern Georgia. In his campaign,\u00a0Barrow\u00a0targeted the state\u2019s restrictive abortion ban signed into law by Kemp. The ban\u00a0prohibits most abortions after six weeks, before most women know they\u2019re pregnant.\u00a0The former congressman\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0Georgia needed a Supreme Court justice who would \u201cprotect the right of women and their families to make the most personal family and health care decisions they\u2019ll ever make.\u201d Barrow\u2019s talk about abortion earned him an ethics complaint\u00a0from the state Judicial Qualifications Commission, alleging\u00a0that\u00a0he\u2019d violated\u00a0code of conduct rules on appearing impartial. Barrow sued the commission in federal court, arguing\u00a0that it\u00a0was a violation\u00a0of his\u00a0First\u00a0Amendment\u00a0rights. A judge dismissed the case ahead of the election. Pinson was the only Georgia Supreme Court justice to face a challenger Tuesday as three other justices ran unopposed. Eight of the nine justices on the state high court were initially appointed by Republican governors. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_trump-trial-jury-analysis", "text": "It was a tawdry tale of lies, revenge and hush money, with a sordid alleged bedroom scene, a judge whose patience finally cracked and a raging defendant who is a once and possibly future president. But there\u2019ll be no more evidence, witnesses, or brutal cross-examinations in Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial, which has moved into the final phase before jurors retire to deliberate their verdict in a historic case entangled with the 2024 election. Unusually, there will now be a break of a week \u2014 because of the Memorial Day holiday \u2014 between Tuesday\u2019s final testimony and when lawyers for each side lay out their final narratives in closing summations. Then the judge will deliver his instructions \u2014 a critical stage of the case in which the jury will learn how to apply the law and to weigh conflicting testimony and different kinds of evidence. That\u2019s when seven men and five women from New York will have to decide whether Trump will be the first ex-president convicted of a crime and the first presumptive nominee running as a convicted felon. The former president has been preparing for the moment for weeks. He\u2019s mounted a daily campaign to destroy the reputation of the court and Judge Juan Merchan, as well as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, who brought the case. \u201cThe judge hates Donald Trump, just take a look, take a look at him, take a look at where he comes from. He can\u2019t stand Donald Trump,\u201d the former president said on Tuesday in the latest of his daily media rants in the corridor. At one point, the judge threatened to send him to jail if he continued to violate a gag order protecting key witnesses \u2013 establishing a red line that the ex-president is yet to cross. Trump\u2019s bizarre practice of reading aloud critiques of the case from his allies in conservative media was all designed to create an atmosphere of grievance around the trial, which he\u2019s leveraged to bolster the core rationale of his White House campaign \u2014 that he\u2019s a persecuted victim of weaponized justice. As the weeks went on, Trump was joined at the court by a cadre of Republican lawmakers, exemplifying his total control over the GOP after winning his third consecutive nomination and its continued genuflection toward a leader who tried to destroy American democracy to stay in power after the 2020 election. It\u2019s still early to say if the case in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty \u2014 and the eventual verdict \u2014 will have any influence on voters this fall. But there is little sense the trial, from which television cameras are barred, has captured the imagination of the nation. The intricate task that awaits jurors It\u2019s impossible to know how jurors are interpreting the daily drama of the courtroom in any trial. But there\u2019s a lot to sort out in a case that has grave implications for Trump\u2019s future, and even his liberty, and comes with huge political overtones as potentially the only one of his four criminal trials to be completed before the election. In a month of dramatic testimony, the prosecution alleged that Trump illegally falsified business records to cover up a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to deceive voters in 2016 in an example of election interference. Trump has denied the alleged affair with Daniels, and hush money payments are not illegal in themselves. But the jury must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York State prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records \u2014 which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime \u2014 in relation to the election. \u201cThe defendant Donald Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,\u201d prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement in April. The defense, however, contends that Trump is innocent of any crime. His lawyers have sought to cast doubt on the paper trail established by prosecutors by saying Trump had nothing to do with falsifying financial records and they\u2019ve tried to obliterate the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s star witness, Michael Cohen. The ex-president\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d is critical to the case because he provided the only direct implication of Trump in an alleged scheme to break the law with the cover up of the payment. And the defense tried to establish that Trump did not try to suppress details of his alleged affair with Daniels as part of a scheme to mislead voters. Rather, they argued, he was worried that it would upset his family. And in his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors: \u201cI have a spoiler alert. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election: It\u2019s called democracy.\u201d The critical witness Cohen\u2019s testimony will likely be a critical element of the deliberations \u2014 especially whether the damage done to his trustworthiness during a searing cross-examination is enough to convince one or more jurors they cannot convict Trump based on his former fixer\u2019s word. Prosecutors knew that they had a problem with Cohen heading into the trial since he had already gone to jail after being found guilty over offenses related to the hush money payment and other crimes, including lying to Congress. They therefore sought to buttress his testimony before he took the stand with days of evidence. They called David Pecker, the former head of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Pecker was not directly involved in the hush money payment at the center of the case. But he was used to establish that Cohen and Trump had a record of using payments to squash unflattering stories about the future president before the 2016 election. Former White House communications director and long-time Trump aide Hope Hicks was also called by the prosecution and appeared to put her former boss in a heap of trouble when she said that his campaign was transfixed with worry over the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that showed him boasting that he could grab women by the genitals. Hicks testified that Trump believed that the Daniels story would be even more damaging. \u201cIt would be better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\u201d Hicks said of his thinking. Why the most salacious evidence may have been \u2018best left unsaid\u2019 In the most risqu\u00e9 chapter of the trial, Daniels was called to testify about her alleged liaison with Trump in a suite in Lake Tahoe in 2006. Daniels said that she \u201cspanked\u201d Trump \u201cright on the butt\u201d with a magazine and returned from the bathroom to find him on the bed in his boxers and a T-shirt. She said that they had sex and that she was shaking when she left the room, which she remembered for its black-and-white-tiled floor. The judge had sought to limit the details of the encounter ahead of time, and after the testimony he commented that some of the explicit details were \u201cbest left unsaid.\u201d But the Daniels testimony was critical to the prosecution case because it illustrated the alleged liaison that it wants jurors to believe was the genesis of the cover up. When Cohen finally took the stand, he directly implicated Trump in the alleged scheme to buy Daniels\u2019 silence.\u00a0\u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, smart people, and \u2018That it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re a billionaire, just pay it. There\u2019s no reason to keep this thing out there so do it.\u2019 He expressed to me, \u2018Just do it,\u2019\u201d Cohen said, paraphrasing Trump\u2019s alleged instructions to him. The former fixer, who once said he\u2019d take a bullet for Trump, also denied that he had acted alone, saying that everything he did for his former boss required Trump\u2019s sign off \u2014 and that he wanted to make sure he was paid back. But Cohen\u2019s reputation came back to haunt him in a cross-examination when the defense claimed he was a liar who was obsessed with bringing Trump down and that he was getting rich from his media appearances and podcasts focusing on his former idol. The key moment came when Cohen was tripped up over a phone call about which he\u2019d previously testified under oath. He said he had discussed with Trump the payment of the hush money in that October 2016 call. But the defense produced texts Cohen sent before the call \u2014 placed to the phone of Trump\u2019s bodyguard, who was with the then-2016 GOP nominee \u2014 that suggested the subject of the 96-second conversation was another matter. In response, prosecutors used their redirect examination to try to downplay the importance of a single call, and Cohen said he spoke to Trump about the payment multiple times, not just on that occasion. But Trump\u2019s lawyers beseeched the judge on Monday to throw out the trial based on Cohen\u2019s testimony, saying the jury should not be asked to deliver a verdict based on what the defense viewed as unsafe evidence. \u201cThere is no way that the Court should let this case go to the jury, relying on Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony,\u201d Blanche told Merchan. In comparison to the weeks of testimony put on by the prosecution, the defense case lasted only 90 minutes and included only two witnesses before Trump\u2019s lawyers rested on Tuesday. That meant the former president, who many experts thought would pose a massive risk to his own case if he testified, did not take the stand. Some experts questioned whether the defense would also have been better not to have called one of its witnesses \u2014\u00a0Robert Costello, who got into a verbal altercation with an infuriated Merchan, some of which was seen by the jury. In an extraordinary scene, Merchan asked whether Costello was trying to stare him down after the witness had registered contempt for several of the judge\u2019s interventions. Costello was meant to rebut a claim by prosecutors that Trump mounted a pressure campaign to keep Cohen quiet in 2018. But he may have ended up creating a hole in the Trump defense, according to several legal experts. At the very least, his spell on the stand may have made a case that looked in recent days like it could turn on the reputation of Cohen once again focus on the behavior and character of the ex-president. It may have all been a sideshow that will have little bearing on the eventual destiny of the trial. But only the jury can decide that.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/trump-trial-jury-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story this week. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this week, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The statement continued, \u201cBrad Paisley and the Howard Gospel Choir were chosen by Dr. Biden to honor President and First Lady Ruto\u2019s love of Country and Gospel music, and in celebration of the continuing friendship between the United States and Kenya.\u201d A state visit\u00a0is among the highest diplomatic tools a White House can employ to honor a top ally, with the\u00a0meticulously planned event aimed at intertwining and highlighting American and Kenyan cultures as Biden seeks to\u00a0emphasize the strong alliance\u00a0between the two countries. Biden and Ruto welcomed Kenyan and American business leaders to the White House on Wednesday as part of the African leader\u2019s official state visit. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way to kick off this visit,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToday as we honor 60 years of ties between our countries, it\u2019s clear that our people are the true strength of this partnership. And a partnership that is working well. And nowhere is it more important than in the realm of innovation.\u201d He also thanked the leaders attending, telling them to \u201ckeep it up.\u201d This visit marks the first time an American president has hosted an African leader for a state visit since February 2008, when President George W.

But he has hailed cooperation with Africa and is seeking to build relationships with key leaders as a counter to Russia and China\u2019s inroads on the continent.

And he joined Jill Biden for a visit to a pop-up Covid-19 vaccination site in Nashville in June 2021. Paisley first performed at the White House in 2009 during the Obama administration as part of a music series. He recalled the emotion of singing the song \u201cWelcome to the Future\u201d in front of then-President Barack Obama. \u201cThe last verse is about a kid in high school who\u2019s having a difficult time, and who\u2019s Black, and he has a cross burned in his yard for asking out the homecoming queen. And the line of the chorus is, \u2018Wake up Martin Luther, welcome to the future,\u2019\u201d he wrote in a CNN blog post at the time. He continued, \u201cBeing able to deliver that message personally to one of the people who ushered in this new era is really one of the most completely, artistically satisfying moments I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d The first lady told reporters that Thursday\u2019s state dinner will be held outdoors on the White House grounds. \u201cTomorrow night we mark the 60th anniversary of the United States partnership with Kenya with an elegant dinner under the stars in a pavilion made almost entirely of glass looking up at our one sky,\u201d Jill Biden said, even though rain is in the forecast for the Washington area. \u201cWhile outside night surrounds us, inside guests will be brought together over the glow of candles in a space saturated with warm pinks and reds.\u201d The dinner will be held in a \u201ctransparent pavilion\u201d on the South Lawn, according to the first lady\u2019s office, that will be adorned with more than 1,000 candles. \u201cTomorrow night we\u2019ve created an experience that will feature the beautiful scenes of the White House and the Washington Monument that few get to enjoy,\u201d White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo said.

The vast majority of Americans opposed same-sex marriage on May 17, 2004, when the first same-sex couples took their vows after a court decision in Massachusetts. The state\u2019s Republican governor at the time, Mitt Romney, planned to invoke an archaic 1913 law in an attempt to bar same-sex couples from traveling from other states to obtain marriages in Massachusetts. Then-President George W. Bush, a Republican running for reelection, gave an address from the White House that year actively pushing to amend the US Constitution to \u201cprotect\u201d marriage, which he described as \u201cthe most fundamental institution of civilization.\u201d There was verifiable backlash to marriage equality in November 2004, when voters in 11 states \u2013 ranging from reliably red Utah to reliably blue Oregon \u2013 codified in their constitutions that marriage should be between a man and a woman. The marriage amendment approved in Ohio by an overwhelming majority may have helped sway that pivotal state into Bush\u2019s column as he retained the White House. The effort to oppose same-sex marriage certainly didn\u2019t hurt him in the state. Without Ohio, Bush would have lost to then-Sen. John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who opposed same-sex marriages taking place in his own state. The 2015 Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, by which a divided 5-4 court would ultimately grant a right to same-sex marriage, sprang up as a result of this Ohio amendment. In CNN exit polls for the presidential election in 2004, just a quarter of all American voters that year said they supported marriage rights for same-sex couples. A larger proportion, 35%, supported giving same-sex couples the ability to enter into civil unions. And 37% opposed legal recognition of same-sex unions. Barack Obama notably opposed same-sex marriage when he ran for president as a Democrat in the 2008 election and, as public opinion was rapidly shifting, changed his tune in 2012 to support same-sex unions. In eight years, the US went from the winning candidate (Bush in 2004) exploiting opposition to same-sex marriage to win reelection, to the winning candidate (Obama in 2012) changing his position to support marriage equality before winning reelection. Now, it\u2019s Congress protecting same-sex marriage from the Supreme Court A decade later, in 2022, the person Obama beat in 2012, now-Sen. Romney, voted in favor of protecting same-sex unions in the event the US Supreme Court decided to strip away the national right to marry that it granted in 2015. The court today is much more conservative than it was in 2015 after two justices who supported same-sex marriage rights, Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were replaced with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, respectively. Two current conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, still publicly grouse about the Obergefell decision, but it\u2019s not clear if an opportunity to overturn the decision will present itself or if the conservative justices who weren\u2019t on the court in 2015 would support removing the right to same-sex marriage in the same way they endorsed removing a right to abortion. Romney does not now support same-sex marriages, but he made clear when he voted to protect them from the Supreme Court that he does respect people who have entered into them: \u201cWhile I believe in traditional marriage,\u201d Romney said in a statement, \u201cObergefell is and has been the law of the land upon which LGBTQ individuals have relied. This legislation provides certainty to many\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0Americans,\u00a0and it signals that Congress\u2014and I\u2014esteem and love all of our fellow Americans equally.\u201d The Respect for Marriage Act that Romney supported does not guarantee a national right to same-sex marriage if the Supreme Court changes course, but it does require every state to honor marriages conducted legally in other states. If the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell, most states still have laws and constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage, according to an analysis by Stateline. \u2018Stunning\u2019 reversal The annual American Values survey conducted by PRRI in 2023 found a strong majority of Americans \u2013 more than two-thirds \u2013 now support same-sex unions, but the support varies. In states that protect same-sex marriage regardless of Obergefell, support is over 70%. Support falls to 64% in states where same-sex marriage would end without Obergefell. I talked to Alex Lundry, a Republican pollster and longtime supporter of same-sex marriage,  about how he views this 20-year pivot in public opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning in its reversal,\u201d Lundry said, adding, \u201cin my opinion, it\u2019s the most significant and substantial shift in public opinion of the modern polling era.\u201d 20% of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ Lundry pointed to a series of data points to explain the overwhelming shift in public opinion: \u25ba First, more people identify as LGBTQ. He pointed to data from Gallup,  which saw the portion of the population who identify as LGBTQ more than double from 3.5% in 2012, when the organization first started asking people about their sexual orientation, to 7.2% 2022, the last year for which it has data. \u25ba More importantly, maybe, is that almost 20% of Gen Z Americans, those born between 1997 and 2004, identify as LGBTQ, with most of them identifying as bisexual. \u25ba As a result, more people know and care about someone who is gay. That trend was already underway back in 2004, when Bush\u2019s vice president, Dick Cheney, one of whose daughters is gay, openly disagreed with the push for an anti-same-sex marriage constitutional amendment. Today there is far more representation of gay outlooks in the media and in government, where the organization Out for America, which tracks representation, found the number of openly LGBTQ lawmakers rose from less than 500 in 2017 to nearly 1,200 in 2023. \u25ba Underlying all of that is that the number of same-sex couples has more than doubled from less than 600,000 in 2008 to more than 1.2 million in 2021, roughly 710,000 of which are married, according to Census Bureau data. Warnings were unfounded There is also evidence that warnings about same-sex marriage somehow endangering \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d simply never materialized. A new study by researchers for the RAND Corporation to assess two decades of same-sex marriage in the US argues marriage rates actually increased among opposite-sex couples as same-sex couples were granted the ability to marry in certain states. Physical health also improved in those states for same-sex couples, according to the study. Another societal shift Abortion rights are another social issue politicians hope to use to move the coming election. A key difference between support for same-sex marriage and support for abortion rights, according to Lundry, is that support for abortion rights has remained positive for decades, in contrast to same-sex marriage, which saw a complete turnaround. The only other issue where he argued there has been such a pivot is on legalizing marijuana, support for which has gone from about a third in 2002 to 70% in 2023, according to Gallup. Not at all coincidentally, President Joe Biden has moved in this election year to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug, acknowledging there are legitimate uses for it and making the government view it as a substance with a lower risk for abuse. Meanwhile, the ever-evolving fight over LGBTQ rights continues. An issue driving state legislatures today is transgender rights, particularly regarding children and gender-affirming care.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/same-sex-marriage-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Sandra Thompson, a veteran of the FDIC and current director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and Christy Romero, a longtime financial regulator and current commissioner on the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, are among the candidates, these sources said. Both officials have been involved in promoting President Joe Biden\u2019s regulatory agenda and have secured Senate confirmation \u2013 Thompson with a vote of 49-46, and Romero by voice vote \u2013 to serve in their current roles. Other names said to be under discussion are Adrienne Harris, the top financial regulator in New York state, and Graham Steele, a former adviser to Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who now leads financial regulation at the Treasury Department. A White House official noted that a shortlist has not yet been finalized, and other names could be added to the mix in a process that is fast-moving but still early. The White House wants to move quickly with a nomination, the official told CNN, to begin the process of scheduling a hearing for the candidate before Brown \u2013 running for reelection in Ohio \u2013 goes into campaign mode. Martin Gruenberg, the current FDIC chairman, submitted his resignation Monday after a scathing report uncovered widespread instances of sexual harassment and intimidation at the agency during his multiple tenures atop the agency. Gruenberg will remain in the role until a successor is named. Following the release of an independent report into the conduct of agency leadership \u2013 and testimony by Gruenberg on the report \u2013 multiple employees reached out to congressional and White House offices, leading the chairman\u2019s tenure to become, in sources\u2019 words, \u201cuntenable.\u201d White House and congressional sources agree a culture shift at the agency \u2013 which holds a critical role regulating the country\u2019s banking system \u2013 is needed immediately. There are few instances of an administration having to nominate a high-profile regulator so late in the term, when lawmakers on both sides of the aisle turn their sights toward reelection efforts, resulting in political stalemate on most issues. The term for the FDIC\u2019s chairman is five years, in theory positioning a Biden nominee to continue regulating the country\u2019s banks well beyond the November election. In practice, partisan politics have played an outsized role.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_us-gaza-pier-aid-not-delivered", "text": "None of the aid that has been unloaded from the temporary pier the US constructed off the coast of Gaza has been delivered to the broader Palestinian population,\u00a0as the US\u00a0works with the UN and Israel to identify\u00a0safe\u00a0delivery routes inside the enclave, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. Several desperate Gazans intercepted trucks delivering aid from the pier over the weekend, leading the UN to suspend the delivery operations until the logistical challenges are resolved. The US\u00a0is\u00a0working\u00a0with Israel and the United Nations to establish \u201calternative routes\u201d for the safe delivery of the 569 tons of aid transported to Gaza since last week, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday. Asked\u00a0whether\u00a0any of the\u00a0aid has been delivered to the people of Gaza, Ryder said, \u201cAs of today, I do not believe so.\u201d\u00a0He added that aid had been held in an assembly area on shore, but as of Tuesday had begun getting moved to warehouses for distribution throughout Gaza as alternative routes have been established. A US official told CNN that the Defense Department and UN are still working to determine\u00a0how much aid can be held at he staging area inside Gaza at any given time. The amount of aid getting to the Gaza shoreline from its initial staging area in Cyprus has also fallen short of initial Pentagon estimates. Since Friday, more than\u00a0569 metric tons of humanitarian assistance have been delivered through the temporary pier, called JLOTS,\u00a0or Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, to the shore of Gaza to be distributed by humanitarian partners, Ryder said. But\u00a0Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper, the commander of the US Naval Forces Central Command, said last week that the US hoped to initially transport 500 tons of aid per day via the pier, and scale up as time went on. Over the weekend, as trucks began moving the aid delivered off the floating pier,\u00a0CNN reported that a group of\u00a0men in Gaza intercepted the aid,\u00a0saying\u00a0they did not trust that\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0actually meant\u00a0for the Palestinian people. \u201cI have doubts,\u201d Mounir Ayad, a\u00a0Gaza resident, told CNN near the\u00a0pier. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this floating pier or what it indicates and what its purpose is. They say it\u2019s for\u00a0aid, but people are apprehensive. Is this\u00a0aid\u00a0or something else? We know that the US has never supported the Palestinian cause, so it\u2019s implausible that it\u2019s giving us\u00a0aid\u00a0without something in return.\u201d Ryder acknowledged on Tuesday that some initial aid brought into Gaza was \u201cintercepted by some people who took that aid off those vehicles.\u201d \u201cFully appreciating the desperation, but also fully appreciating the fact that it is very important that this aid get to the people who need it most, that\u2019s going to continue to be the focus. So I understand, you know, the focus on why is this not working, or why is that not working, but what we\u2019re focused on is how we can work to ensure that the Palestinian people get the aid.\u201d The Pentagon\u00a0said in April\u00a0that the goal was to deliver roughly 500 tons of aid \u2014\u00a0amounting to 90 truckloads \u2014\u00a0per day to the starving population of Gaza, with the intent of working up to 150 trucks daily. The pier was finally\u00a0anchored to Gaza\u00a0last week as the humanitarian situation in the\u00a0enclave\u00a0has only worsened. Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of\u00a0the US Agency for International Development\u2019s\u00a0Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said last week that conditions in Gaza \u201chave not improved and in the past two weeks we have seen a vital border crossing close, and at a time when it is critical we see more aid move. Across Gaza, 2.2 million people,\u00a0the entire population, is facing acute food insecurity.\u201d The US has faced\u00a0a number of challenges\u00a0with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah which could raise security concerns; early issues with establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza, as the US has repeatedly said no US troops would have boots on the ground; and logistical challenges like sea and weather conditions that could continue to limit the ability to use it. Ryder said Tuesday that the US is continuing to push for aid to get in other ways, including through land routes. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is continuing to have conversations with his Israeli counterpart regarding the effort to get aid through land crossings, including through Rafah, he said. When White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli officials as part of his trip to the Middle East over the weekend, the Israelis presented their latest thinking about a potential Rafah incursion during which the US side asked a lot of \u201chard questions,\u201d according to a senior administration official. This person noted that the two sides will continue those discussions but that the Israelis have been incorporating US feedback and concerns as they continue to work through those plans. The official added that both sides share the joint goal of destroying Hamas. As part of the discussions with the Israelis, US officials also made a series of \u201cspecific requests\u201d with regard to humanitarian aid, which they have agreed to implement, according to the official.  One of these requests included helping facilitate aid distribution by getting the Israelis to agree to allow aid scanned in Cyprus to be sent directly to the Israeli port of Ashdod, bypassing Egypt. Currently, cargo\u00a0not being transported to Gaza via the pier\u00a0must go through Egypt to be scanned before then being brought into the enclave. \u201cI thought the the conversations were, were quite constructive and now we\u2019re looking to see some of what was agreed unfold here over the coming days,\u201d the official said. Just Tuesday, according to this person, over 370 pallets of aid were distributed in Gaza. The US has also made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force. It\u2019s unclear with what regularity those will continue; Ryder said Tuesday it is an \u201coption we have available to us\u201d but he declined to say\u00a0whether\u00a0that effort would continue \u201cwell into the future.\u201d The last humanitarian air drop announced by US Central Command was conducted on May 9. \u201cThis is not a sole US military effort, it\u2019s an interagency effort. It\u2019s an international effort. And we understand the desperate need of the Palestinian people right now,\u201d Ryder said of efforts to get aid into Gaza.\u00a0 \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to continue to work to get them what they need.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_appeals-court-hunter-biden-gun-trial", "text": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected\u00a0the latest attempt\u00a0by Hunter Biden to pause his upcoming gun trial while the president\u2019s son pursues some long-shot appeals. The trial is scheduled to begin June 3 in Delaware. The quick decision came from the same three-judge panel that\u00a0previously rejected\u00a0one of Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to throw out the indictment. The panel includes one Republican-appointed judge and two Democratic appointees, including one put on the bench by Hunter Biden\u2019s father, President Joe Biden. This is one of several bids by Hunter Biden to slow down or postpone his gun trial. So far, his efforts have fallen flat, and the trial judge\u00a0hasn\u2019t shown any openness\u00a0to delaying the case. Special counsel David Weiss has\u00a0charged\u00a0Hunter Biden with illegally purchasing and possessing a gun, in violation of federal law because he was addicted to illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to the three-count indictment and claims he\u2019s being politically targeted. To prove his case, Weiss intends to present\u00a0intensely personal testimony\u00a0from witnesses who can describe Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime crack cocaine abuse, including from three former romantic partners. They include Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife and the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden. Prosecutors also said in recent court filings that they plan to present text messages showing Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to buy crack cocaine from drug dealers, as well as messages in which he fights with his family members about his inability to get sober. Much of the case revolves around Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, which he has described as a lifelong struggle. To win a conviction, prosecutors will need to convince a jury that Hunter Biden was abusing illegal drugs while he bought and briefly owned the gun in 2018. Hunter Biden\u00a0testified at a court hearing last year that he has been sober since 2019. The spate of filings and delay-attempts in the gun case comes\u00a0as Hunter Biden is preparing for a separate tax trial in California, which was also brought by Weiss\u2019 team. That trial is scheduled for late June, a few weeks after the gun case is expected to wrap up. There is a hearing set for Wednesday in Los Angeles, where the judge overseeing the tax case will weigh whether to put the proceedings\u00a0on hold. Separately on Tuesday, Weiss\u2019\u00a0team asked a judge to force\u00a0Hallie Biden\u00a0to testify in the California-based tax case.\u00a0This spat pits the Justice Department against\u00a0\ufeffthe widow of President Biden\u2019s first-born son, Beau, and the mother of two of his grandchildren. Prosecutors said in a court filing that they need a judge to compel Hallie Biden\u2019s testimony because her lawyers have made it clear that she would \u201crefuse to answer questions\u201d by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. \u201cIn the judgment of the Special Counsel, the testimony of Hallie Biden may be necessary to the public interest,\u201d Weiss\u2019 team wrote to the judge in the tax case. In\u00a0the\u00a0filing, Weiss said a top official from the\u00a0Justice Department\u2019s tax division, Stuart Goldberg, gave him authorization to try to force Hallie Biden\u2019s testimony.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_joe-biden-donald-trump-unified-reich", "text": "President Joe Biden and his campaign are looking to capitalize on former President Donald Trump\u2019s posting of a video showing images of a fake newspaper article that references a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he\u2019s reelected in 2024. The video underscores Biden\u2019s central argument from his 2020 run and plays directly into what has shaped his reelection effort this year: the country cannot afford to give Trump another four years in office. The president has repeatedly said he decided to reenter political life and run for the White House in 2020 after Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d at a deadly White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The video has been removed from Trump\u2019s Truth Social account, but the Biden campaign has quickly incorporated the former president\u2019s use of verbiage associated with Nazi Germany into messaging. Biden made Trump\u2019s comments the focus of two closed-door campaign fundraisers Tuesday night, a video on his social media platforms and a fundraising email. \u201cThat\u2019s not the language of any Americans. It\u2019s the language of Hitler\u2019s Germany,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0told donors in Boston during a campaign reception. He added, \u201cThe threat that Trump poses is greater in the second term than it was in the first.\u201d The term \u201creich\u201d is often associated with Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, who designated Germany a \u201cThird\u00a0Reich\u201d from 1933 to 1945. The video details \u201cwhat happens after Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0wins\u201d with a narrator reading hypothetical headlines like \u201cEconomy Booms!\u201d and \u201cBorder is closed,\u201d styled as World War I-era newspaper clippings. Under one headline that reads \u201cWhat\u2019s next for America?\u201d is a reference to the \u201ccreation of a unified\u00a0Reich.\u201d Another headline in the video states \u201c15 Million Illegal Aliens Deported\u201d next to the start and end days of World War I. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the video was not created by the campaign and was \u201creposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word, while the President was in court.\u201d Biden has previously compared Trump\u2019s messaging to that used by Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime. In November, after Trump compared his political rivals to \u201cvermin\u201d and said undocumented immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country,\u201d Biden said it was the type of language often used in 1930s Germany. A campaign fundraising email sent Tuesday also highlighted Trump\u2019s previous remark that he would not be a dictator in a potential second term \u201cexcept for day one.\u201d Biden\u00a0has had trouble getting voters to view his policy record as successful so far during the 2024 campaign, with polls showing his approval rating underwater and his marks on the economy and inflation remaining starkly negative. His campaign has increasingly embraced taking on the former president, aiming to amplify what they see as the threat Trump poses if he takes office again. Throughout Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York, the campaign has needled the former president without directly getting Biden involved in commenting on the case. However, Biden has used subtle jabs in social media videos to indirectly poke fun at his opponent, and his campaign returned to that strategy in an attempt to highlight the \u201cunified Reich\u201d moment, showing what appeared to be Biden\u2019s first reaction to hearing about the post. \u201cIs this on his official account?\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0asks in the video. \u201cWow.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s Hitler\u2019s language. That\u2019s not America\u2019s. He cares about holding onto power. I care about you.\u201d When talking to donors, Biden said that Trump\u2019s language is beneath the office he once held and is looking to regain and that it was not the \u201clanguage of American presidents.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s only obsessed with one thing, about losing in 2020. It unhinged him. I meant it. The guy\u2019s a little unhinged,\u201d\u00a0Biden said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-unified-reich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, and Democratic Rep. Katie Porter. The bill would require presidents and vice presidents to disclose their tax returns and any foreign payments made to them or their families in the two years prior to taking office, during their term in office and in the two years following. Presidents and vice presidents would also be required to disclose any conflicts of interest. It would require presidents and vice presidents to disclose any loans or loan repayments made to them by family members over $10,000 and report when immediate family members accompany the president or vice president on official travel. While Comer has spent much of his chairmanship scrutinizing President Joe Biden and Hunter Biden\u2019s finances and business dealings as part of an impeachment inquiry, Democrats have said similar scrutiny should apply to former President Donald Trump \u2013 who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \u2013 and his family. Trump has long been under scrutiny for not releasing his tax returns and Democrats have uncovered nearly $8 million in payments from other countries to Trump-owned businesses and properties while Trump was in office. It\u2019s not yet clear if House Republicans will bring the bill to the floor. The legislation represents a rare collaboration between two lawmakers on different sides of the political spectrum. Comer\u2019s committee found that\u00a0as a private citizen, Biden was repaid $240,000 in loans he gave his brother prior to taking office, and detailed how Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, flew with him on many foreign trips while Biden was vice president. \u201cThe Presidential Ethics Reform Act is landmark bipartisan legislation that delivers the transparency and accountability the American people deserve to ensure our public offices are not for sale,\u201d Comer said in a statement. \u201cInfluence peddling is a cottage industry in Washington and we\u2019ve identified deficiencies in current law that have led to a culture of corruption.\u201d Porter said in a statement, \u201cBy\u00a0boosting transparency and requiring additional financial disclosures, Congress can shine a light on improper conduct in the Executive Branch\u2014or be confident that none occurred.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_nadine-menendez-trial-mortgage-consulting-job", "text": "Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s alleged co-conspirator in a yearslong extortion and bribery scheme ordered his legal counsel to set up a mortgage loan for the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s then-girlfriend and to draft a job contract for her despite her lack of experience, a witness in the federal corruption trial testified this week. Federal prosecutors have begun to lay the foundation for their\u00a0case against Menendez and his two co-defendants\u00a0in a New York courtroom. Through Tuesday, they had called\u00a0six\u00a0witnesses \u2013 an FBI special agent; a US diplomat; a former State Department employee; the lead counsel for the halal certification company owned by Wael Hana, one of Menendez\u2019s co-defendants; and\u00a0the executive assistants to Hana and\u00a0Fred Daibes, Menendez\u2019s other co-defendant.\u00a0Both executive assistants said they were subpoenaed. Some of the witnesses have testified about a halal industry scheme in which Menendez and Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, allegedly acted as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. It\u2019s one of several accusations in the sprawling case that also involves the government of Qatar, gold bars and cash seized from the senator\u2019s home, and allegations that he and his girlfriend-turned-wife took bribes in exchange for the senator\u2019s influence. Menendez and Hana \u2013 as well as the other co-defendant, New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes \u2013 have pleaded not guilty. Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, has also pleaded not guilty and is set to go on trial in July. John Moldovan, the lead counsel for Hana\u2019s certification business IS EG Halal, testified that Hana ordered him to wire Nadine Menendez a loan to pay the outstanding debt on her home, which was at risk of foreclosure. In July 2019, Hana wired Moldovan money from IS EG\u2019s account to Moldovan\u2019s personal account and ordered him to issue checks to Nadine Menendez, the lead counsel testified. Hana also asked him to write a promissory note so that Nadine Menendez would receive about $22,000 to $23,000, with a five-year term to pay back the amount in full, Moldovan testified. Moldovan said Nadine Menendez was \u201cupset and offended\u201d that Hana had a lawyer formalize the loan with a promissory note. She never signed the agreement, he testified, but she did receive the checks. Shortly after that, Moldovan testified, Hana told him he planned to give Nadine Menendez a consulting job at IS EG Halal and ordered Moldovan to prepare the job contract, which included payroll of $10,000 a month. Moldovan testified that he rarely did anything without Hana\u2019s approval. Moldovan said he drafted a contract between IS EG Halal and Strategic International Business Consultants LLC \u2013 of which Nadine Menendez was president \u2013 despite not having heard of the company. Moldovan said he never observed Nadine Menendez work or prepare any documents, nor did he hear of anyone speaking about her job performance for the company or other companies. Nadine Menendez never signed the IS EG job agreement, according to Moldovan. While he also said he didn\u2019t know if she got paid, prosecutors have pointed to three $10,000 checks. On cross-examination, the senator\u2019s attorney, Avi Weitzman, asked Moldovan if Nadine Menendez ever mentioned she was dating the senator, to which he testified she did not. The pair later married. Trial proceedings are on pause\u00a0until after Memorial\u00a0Day, when Daibes\u2019 executive assistant\u00a0is expected to\u00a0return to the witness stand.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_kristi-noem-dog-wrong-photo", "text": "The photo of the dog believed to be the one South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem shot and killed\u00a0has been seen millions of times on social media. It\u2019s been published by one of the United Kingdom\u2019s biggest newspapers. It was even distributed by a Washington, DC, animal rights group in a memo blasting Noem. Indeed, when I Googled \u201cKristi Noem\u2019s dog\u201d\u00a0this morning, it was one of the first pictures that popped up. But the dog in the photo isn\u2019t Noem\u2019s. In an era of deepfakes and artificial intelligence,\u00a0the photo\u00a0is an important reminder in this election year that we can all still fall for far less sophisticated types of misinformation \u2014 especially when they come in the form of an adorable puppy. And while the dog\u2019s mistaken identity is\u00a0undoubtedly good news for the dog in the picture (we are told he is alive and well), it\u2019s a not so good reflection of the way we can all easily encounter and share unchecked viral misinformation. Individual forums on Reddit are known as \u201csubreddits,\u201d and\u00a0there is an endless\u00a0universe of them devoted to dogs.\u00a0 It was on the \u201cPuppy\u201d subreddit where user \u201cLukeWarm273\u201d posted a photo of their dog \u201cBlue\u201d last year. The Reddit post was identified in a recent report by NewsGuard, a journalism organization that rates the reliability of news websites and tracks online disinformation campaigns. \u201cThis is Blue, he\u2019s 3/4 German Wirehaired pointer and 1/4 shorthair pointer!\u201d LukeWarm273 wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s a cutie,\u201d one Reddit user responded.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s adorable! I love his little nose,\u201d wrote another. The next day, LukeWarm273 posted more, equally adorable pictures of Blue, writing, \u201cEveryone\u2019s kind words made me want to share some more photos of my Blue! Honestly love this community!\u201d But last month \u2014 more than a year after LukeWarm273 posted their first picture of Blue on Reddit \u2014 Blue\u2019s photo started showing up across the internet. An inevitable mix of shock and outrage had followed Noem\u00a0revealing in her book\u00a0that she had shot and killed her dog Cricket (because Cricket had allegedly attacked some chickens,\u00a0bit her and was \u201cuntrainable\u201d).\u00a0Noem\u00a0had once\u00a0been considered a\u00a0contender for former President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for vice\u00a0president,\u00a0but\u00a0CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that the South Dakota governor had already fallen off the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s shortlist long before this controversy began. Still, the\u00a0story quickly entered the national conversation and the internet kicked into high gear. \u201cPlease join me in wishing Cricket (the dog Kristi Noem shot to death) a blessed journey to the land of beautiful puppy dog souls.\u00a0\ud83d\udc94,\u201d one user on X posted after the story emerged. But the picture the user posted with the message wasn\u2019t of Cricket; it was a picture of Blue. The post has been seen almost 600,000 times on X. Even the actor Mark Hamill weighed in on X, sharing a broken heart emoji in response to the photo. It is unclear how the X user found the photo of Blue, and it\u00a0isn\u2019t clear who the first person was to falsely link the photo of Blue to Noem. The image was also shared on X by at least two prominent users with about 900,000 followers each \u2014 they have both since removed it. It showed up in a story about Noem on the website of The Telegraph, one of Britain\u2019s oldest and biggest newspapers. That Telegraph story, along with the photograph, was syndicated through Yahoo! News, bringing it to an even wider audience. The picture, along with the caption, \u201cThe Dog Murdered By Trump\u2019s Potential Vice Presidential Running Mate Choice,\u201d also appeared on the \u201ccommunity\u201d page of Daily Kos, a popular progressive website with more than a million followers on Facebook. Staff at NewsGuard tracked the spread of the image and found a Washington,\u00a0DC-based animal rights group had mistakenly used the picture in a press release blasting Noem\u2019s actions. But the group, Animal Wellness Action, used a press release distribution service that automatically publishes releases to websites of local news outlets across the country. That meant the release and the photo of the dog showed up on the websites of at least 11 local TV stations in places like Florida, Nevada and South Carolina, according to NewsGuard. Joseph Grove, senior director of communications for Animal Wellness Action, told CNN: \u201cOur writer relied on extensive news coverage of the dog and the proliferation of that photo and took as fact that the photo was of Cricket. She had seen the image used, for example, on Yahoo News and the Daily Kos, as well as on numerous other platforms that shared the story. In retrospect, given the importance of credibility to Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy, we should have done our own due diligence. Lesson learned.\u201d Grove said Animal Wellness Action has asked the press release service to issue a clarification. CNN has reached out to The Telegraph for comment.\u00a0Daily Kos added a correction to\u00a0its post\u00a0after it was contacted by NewsGuard. The image \u201cwas not in fact a picture of [Noem\u2019s] late dog,\u201d the correction reads. LukeWarm273 didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The user, who told NewsGuard they want to remain anonymous, did confirm to NewsGuard that the picture that went all over the world is indeed their dog. \u201cThis story shows how fake photos can go viral without the need for Photoshop, AI, or any high-tech tools,\u201d NewsGuard enterprise editor Jack Brewster\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt also highlights how any photo, post, or comment can become the source of a viral false narrative, regardless of intent. In this case, a random Reddit post on a forum for cute puppy photos became the source of a viral false narrative that misled a major news site, local television stations, and dozens of prominent social media commentators.\u201d That spread of such false information can be especially problematic when the topic is controversial.\u00a0\u201cOftentimes content emerges in a controversial news cycle that reinforces the narrative,\u201d Ben Decker, the CEO of Memetica, a threat analysis company that tracks disinformation online, told CNN.\u00a0\u201cThese types of emotive responses muddy the waters of truth,\u00a0reinforcing true narratives with false context.\u201d Joan Donovan, an assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University, explained how online incentive structures reward peddlers of viral content.\u00a0X,\u00a0for example,\u00a0now shares revenue with its users who create content that goes viral (though X says that content shouldn\u2019t be false). Videos and images that pull on our heartstrings (like a cute puppy) are perfect fodder for virality. \u201cWho you trust is paramount because there are massive rewards (money and clout) for attention and amplification online. That incentivizes manipulators to twist or invent stories to make it seem like they got a scoop,\u201d Donovan wrote in an email to CNN. \u201c[I] didn\u2019t appreciate the misuse of my dog\u2019s image because even though it is recorded that she [Noem] did in fact kill her dog, it doesn\u2019t make it right to use an image of some cute dog on the internet to make people even more upset than they are now,\u201d LukeWarm273\u00a0told NewsGuard. LukeWarm273 confirmed Blue is alive and said he is a \u201cgood and protective dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-dog-wrong-photo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_rfk-jr-adviser-abortion", "text": "A key adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign who guided Kennedy on a number of key issues, including on abortion, is stepping away from the campaign. Angela Stanton King, the Kennedy campaign\u2019s Black voter outreach director who played a large role in shaping the independent candidate\u2019s positions on abortion and criminal justice, said in a social media post Tuesday night that she\u2019s \u201cdecided to step away from the political theatre.\u201d Stanton King confirmed to CNN on Wednesday she is stepping down from her role in the campaign, but intends to informally advise Kennedy on select issues. \u201cAfter much reflection, I\u2019ve decided to step away from the political theatre. The increasingly hateful and divisive atmosphere no longer aligns with my values. I will continue to advise RFK Jr. on key community issues. Now, it\u2019s time for me to pursue peace and fully dedicate myself to nonprofit work, supporting pregnant women and returning citizens. This new chapter excites me, as I focus on making a tangible difference where it\u2019s needed most,\u201d Stanton King\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media. Her departure comes shortly after the Kennedy campaign shifted its position on abortion access multiple times, drawing blowback from both abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion groups \u2013 including, at one point, Stanton King herself. Kennedy said in a podcast interview earlier this month he opposes any government limits on abortion and said he supported keeping abortion legal \u201ceven if it\u2019s full term,\u201d referring to a potential abortion performed near the expected delivery date of a child. Stanton King, a former Republican and Trump supporter, publicly criticized Kennedy\u2019s comments in social media posts. After Kennedy reached out to her directly, he ultimately walked back those comments the following day. In a social media post clarifying his position, Kennedy said abortion should be restricted \u201cin the final months of pregnancy.\u201d He did not say specifically the number of weeks of gestation at which he would limit access to abortion but signaled support for restrictions based on the framework created through Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion access before fetal viability. Most experts say fetal viability occurs at around 23-24 weeks. In a podcast interview last week, Kennedy running mate Nicole Shanahan said the campaign supports federal limits restricting abortion access \u201cbetween 15 and 18 weeks.\u201d In a statement to CNN, campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said Shanahan\u2019s comments do not reflect Kennedy\u2019s views and that Kennedy supports restrictions \u201cat fetal viability.\u201d \u201cMr. Kennedy\u2019s position differs from Ms. Shanahan\u2019s, in that he believes the cutoff should be at fetal viability. But both are aligned with the emerging national consensus of no restrictions up till a certain point and restrictions thereafter,\u201d Spear told CNN. Stanton King also played a key role in ushering Shanahan on to the campaign trail. Stanton King helped organize and moderate the first public campaign event Shanahan spoke at in Houston earlier this month, where Shanahan spoke fondly of connecting with Stanton King on a number of issues, including abortion and criminal justice. \u00a0\u201cAngela, when I was chatting with you a few weeks ago, there was one point in which I was sitting here and you\u2019re sitting there, and I just saw this gold light in your eye,\u201d Shanahan said at the Houston event. \u201cYou were talking to me about why you\u2019re a pro-lifer. And I realized in that moment there was nothing you could say that I could disagree with because it was coming from a place of fierce, fierce protection for the mothers and children in your community.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/rfk-jr-adviser-abortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_hunter-biden-laptop-gun-trial-special-counsel", "text": "Special counsel David Weiss plans to introduce Hunter Biden\u2019s infamous laptop as evidence against him at his upcoming trial on felony gun charges. Weiss made his intentions clear in a court filing Wednesday that also blasted Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers for questioning the laptop\u2019s authenticity, which he called a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d The laptop is at the center of a yearslong\u00a0legal and political saga, dating to the 2020 election.\u00a0Republican officials\u00a0and\u00a0right-wing outlets\u00a0have seized on the laptop\u2019s embarrassing emails and images to attack Biden, the son of President Joe Biden. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers have said the files\u00a0were manipulated, and even\u00a0sued a computer repair shop owner\u00a0who publicly released the material. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s laptop is real (it will be introduced as a trial exhibit) and it contains significant evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a Wednesday filing. Weiss plans to use the laptop to\u00a0back up\u00a0his narrow claim that  Biden was addicted to illegal drugs when he bought a gun in 2018, allegedly in violation of federal law. Weiss\u00a0has not addressed the\u00a0unproven allegation\u00a0from Republicans that emails on the laptop prove that  Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign deals. Biden has pleaded not guilty to three gun crimes. The trial is\u00a0set to begin\u00a0June 3 at the federal court in Delaware. In their own court filings earlier this week, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers said they want to contest the authenticity of the materials from the laptop if Weiss brings it up at trial. \u201cDefense counsel has numerous reasons to believe the data had been altered and compromised before investigators obtained the electronic material,\u201d his lawyers wrote. Biden\u00a0dropped off the laptop\u00a0at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. His lawyers said in the filing that the shop owner admitted in his memoir that he \u201cbegan accessing sensitive, private material in the data\u201d right away, and continued to potentially tamper with the data throughout the five months before the FBI seized the device. Prosecutors counter by saying that some of the people who exchanged these messages with Biden\u00a0will testify\u00a0and assert that the messages are real. They also say the laptop materials are only a fraction of the digital evidence they have collected against Biden, including messages subpoenaed directly from Apple. \u201cHe has not shown any of the actual evidence in this case is unreliable or inauthentic, because there is none,\u201d Weiss\u2019 team wrote in a Wednesday filing. \u201cInstead, the defendant\u2019s theory about the laptop is a conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\u201d Prosecutors said the laptop materials at issue are \u201cextractions by an FBI forensic specialist which were extracted after a technical examination of the laptop in 2019\u201d \u2013 and not the files that were publicly released by the repair-shop owner or obtained by news outlets \u201cafter who-knows-what was added.\u201d Since 2020, a deluge of material from the laptop has been published in Donald Trump-friendly\u00a0media\u00a0outlets, including sexually explicit videos of Biden with women, as well as photos of him doing drugs in hotel rooms. These outlets have also published emails, financial records and other documents\u00a0from the laptop\u00a0about lucrative overseas business dealings China, Ukraine and elsewhere. Prosecutors say Biden should take the stand in objecting to outside addiction experts On Wednesday, prosecutors also asked the judge overseeing the gun case to reject several expert witnesses the president\u2019s son intends to call at trial, including a clinical researcher focused on addiction treatment. Biden\u2019s mental state is a key issue in the case, which includes allegations that he knowingly made false statements while purchasing a firearm as a user of illegal drugs. His attorneys have not indicated whether he will testify in his own defense. The testimony, prosecutors say, is \u201can attempt to substitute the testimony of an expert for the testimony of\u201d the defendant. While defense attorneys want the doctor to testify on addiction disorders and how individuals understand their own addiction, prosecutors say the testimony should not be allowed, in part, because it would go into the expert\u2019s opinion about the mental state of Hunter Biden at the time of the alleged crime, which they say is not allowed in a criminal trial. \u201cIf the defendants (wants) the jury to know what he thought about his own addiction or drug use, he has to take the stand and testify or introduce other admissible evidence that reflects his state of mind at the time,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cHe cannot hire an expert to do it for him.\u201d Prosecutors also don\u2019t want defense attorneys to be allowed to call a forensic toxicologist, who could be used to undercut evidence regarding the alleged cocaine residue found on Biden\u2019s gun pouch, as well as an expert on handwritten signatures. Federal Judge Maryellen Noreika, who is presiding over the case, hasn\u2019t said when she\u2019ll rule on these pretrial motions about expert witnesses and how the laptop can be discussed in front of the jury.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/hunter-biden-laptop-gun-trial-special-counsel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_senate-republicans-election-control", "text": "The race for the White House hogs most of the attention in a presidential election year, relegating the race for Congress to ugly stepsister status. But in recent years, we\u2019ve all learned how important down-ballot races can be in shaping American policy. That\u2019s especially true for the Senate, which is responsible for the confirmations of government officials and Supreme Court nominees. In this year\u2019s battle for the Senate, like so many cycles before, we have the same competing forces: The election fundamentals favor Republicans, while candidate quality appears to favor Democrats, who currently hold a narrow majority in the chamber. For now, though, it appears even flawed Republican candidates likely won\u2019t be able to stop their side from winning Senate control. Democrats face two \u201cM\u201d problems: the math and the map. Let\u2019s start with the math. Republicans need a net gain of one seat to win the Senate if Donald Trump wins the presidency (with his vice president casting any tie-breaking votes). They need a net gain of two seats for a majority regardless of who wins the presidential election. Republicans have a lot of options to net those one or two seats. Senate Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) hold 23 seats up for election this year; Republicans hold 11. This brings us to the map. Eight of the 23 Democratic seats up for election this year are in states either where Trump won in 2016 or where he is up by at least 5 points in the polls now. Five of them are in states where Trump holds at least a 5-point advantage. Three are in states where Trump won by at least 8 points in 2016 and 2020 and where the incumbent senator is the only Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office. One of those three is West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring. Trump won the state by 39 points in 2020, and every respectable nonpartisan handicapping outlet views the seat as a safe Republican pickup. There are only two Republican Senate seats being targeted by Democrats \u2013 Florida and Texas, which Trump carried by single digits in 2020. But the GOP incumbents in both states currently lead their Democratic opponents by double digits. Every other Republican-held Senate seat on the ballot this year is in a state where GOP presidential candidates have dominated since 2012. It\u2019s no wonder that my colleague Simone Pathe had only one Republican seat (Texas) on her most recent list of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip this year, and that was at No. 10. Positive signs for Democrats But is the race for the Senate really over if Republicans just win West Virginia? No, we can\u2019t call it just yet, and it\u2019s not just because we\u2019re still months before the general election. It\u2019s because if President Joe Biden does win \u2013 a real possibility \u2013 it\u2019s not entirely clear which second Senate seat Republicans will pick up to gain control. Among the eight Democratic Senate seats mentioned above, there are no states beyond West Virginia where the polls (or expert judgment) show Republicans with a solid lead, despite the fundamentals favoring their party this year.\u00a0Democratic Senate candidates seem to be at least tied or ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Democratic Senate candidates\u2019 margins outran Biden\u2019s in the four states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 that The New York Times and Siena College recently polled. And we\u2019re not just talking by a little bit; we\u2019re talking about them doing better than Biden by at least 5 points in those four states among likely voters. A key reason the Democratic candidates are doing so much better than Biden is because they\u2019re popular. We know from recent polls that Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin had positive net favorability ratings, while Biden\u2019s numbers were well under water in these states. Meanwhile in Arizona, Republicans appear poised to nominate Kari Lake for Senate. Lake was last seen losing a very winnable gubernatorial election in 2022 and her high unfavorable score with state voters was a big reason why Inside Elections recently shifted its rating of the race in the Democratic direction. Of course, Democratic Senate candidates outrunning the top of the ticket is nothing new. Republicans have memorably lost plenty of very winnable seats over the past decade and a half with bad candidates (see 2010 with Nevada\u2019s Sharron Angle and 2012 with Missouri\u2019s Todd Akin). Two years ago, Republicans had a net loss of one Senate seat as Democrats retained control of the chamber in a midterm election when Biden had approval ratings in the low 40s. Again, the GOP ran several unpopular candidates (e.g., Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania), while Democrats ran relatively popular ones (e.g., Mark Kelly in Arizona) Back to the math and map Still, it\u2019s hard to ignore Republicans\u2019 advantage in 2024 with the math and the map. Senate Democrats have no margin for error, and they are unlikely to win all seven of their seats currently seen as competitive. The past two presidential cycles tell the tale: Just one state (Maine in 2020) voted differently in the presidential and Senate races. Trump likely holds a comfortable polling advantage of at least 5 points over Biden right now in Arizona, Nevada, Montana and Ohio. His lead in Montana is likely in the double digits. Putting aside the polls, Montana and Ohio were not competitive on the presidential level in either 2016 or 2020 and likely won\u2019t be this fall. For Democrats to have any chance of holding the Senate, Republicans would have to lose all these Senate races. Then they\u2019d have to lose in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all states that Trump could very well win again. Republicans would also have to lose in Maryland \u2013 where Biden will almost certainly win in a blowout, but where GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan has been competitive in the polling. Republicans may be prone to blowing it when it comes to Senate races. But I\u2019m not even sure the Washington Generals of Senate races can blow this one. As a memorable \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode once put it, Republicans may finally be \u201cdue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/senate-republicans-election-control/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

As the November election looms, the administration has been eager to highlight progress in its debt cancellation programs, making announcements such as this one nearly once a month. President Joe Biden has faced blowback from Republicans who accuse the administration of transferring the burden to taxpayers and undermining the Supreme Court,\u00a0which blocked the White House\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan last year. In April, the administration announced another round of cancellations, totaling $7.4 billion for 277,000 borrowers and declared a new group of student debt relief proposals that could go into effect this fall. Wednesday\u2019s addition brings the total number of Americans who have had loans canceled to 4.75 million, relieving an average of over $35,000, the White House said. Borrowers affected by the administration\u2019s newest cancellation were approved through the Biden administration\u2019s SAVE Plan, other income-driven repayment programs or Public Student Loan Forgiveness for qualifying public service workers. \u201cFrom day one of my Administration, I promised to fight to ensure higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\u201d the president said in a statement. \u201cI will never stop working to cancel student debt \u2013 no matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stop us.\u201d Of the borrowers affected by Wednesday\u2019s announcement, 66,900 borrowers \u2014 who saw $5.2 billion forgiven \u2014 qualified through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, bringing the total amount forgiven for borrowers enrolled in the program that aids teachers, nurses and other public service workers to $68 billion. The more than 54,000 borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan who took out smaller loans for graduate studies received $613 million in relief. And an additional 39,200 borrowers who are enrolled in income-driven repayment programs had $1.9 billion relieved. In recent months, the Biden administration has been working on a set of new proposals, based on a different legal authority, to deliver relief to certain groups of borrowers. For example, those whose student loan balances are bigger than what they initially borrowed could see their accumulated interest wiped away. These proposals have yet to be finalized, but administration officials have said that some could take effect as soon as this fall.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_michael-cohen-testimony-trump-trial", "text": "The biggest questions as Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial resumes Monday are whether his attorneys have destroyed the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen \u2014 and how much of the damage prosecutors can fix. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee is due back in court amid clear signs the hush money trial is drawing toward a close \u2014 unless he takes the risky decision to testify in his own defense, a step that would lengthen and complicate the proceedings. Defense lawyers say they expect to complete their bruising cross-examination of Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and enforcer, on Monday morning. Prosecutors will then use their second chance to question Cohen to try to patch up any doubts the ex-president\u2019s team may have sown in the minds of jurors about his version of events. New York state prosecutors allege Trump broke the law by falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. This, they say, was to deceive voters in 2016 in an early example of election interference. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. In dramatic testimony, Cohen last week directly implicated Trump in the alleged scheme, saying the former president directed him to hand over $130,000 to Daniels and promised him reimbursement. \u201cJust do it,\u201d Cohen said in describing his boss\u2019s alleged order to make the payment \u2014 insisting that Trump was worried the story could doom his campaign. But in a critical moment under cross-examination, Cohen appeared to trip up over an account of a call he\u2019d previously said under oath was to discuss the payment. But the call, at least to begin with, appeared to be about another matter entirely. Trump attorney Todd Blanche produced a text from before the call that Cohen sent to bodyguard Keith Schiller, who was with Trump at the time, in which Cohen said he wanted help dealing with a 14-year-old who was prank calling him. He didn\u2019t mention Daniels in the text despite later testifying that the purpose of the call was to discuss the situation surrounding her. \u201cThat was a lie!\u201d Blanche declared, leading Cohen to insist: \u201cI believe I also spoke to President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it\u2019s going to be resolved.\u201d The defense is also trying to portray Cohen as being obsessed with bringing Trump down and has brought up a stream of insults he flung the ex-president\u2019s way on social media and television, including when he called Trump a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d Cohen has long been seen as a potentially problematic witness, given his record of falsehoods and his own conviction \u2014 for events related to the hush money payment and for other offenses including lying to Congress. The prosecution, therefore, built a structure of testimony before he took the stand, including from former associates of the ex-president, to try to corroborate what he would say. But they apparently did not foresee everything, including the text exchange with Schiller. In their redirect examination, therefore, prosecutors are likely to try to mitigate Cohen\u2019s testimony about the call. But if jurors think Cohen lied about the content of the call with Schiller and about whether he spoke to Trump, they could begin to doubt other aspects of his testimony. \u201cThat is exactly what the judge will instruct the jury: \u2018If you find anything that a witness said to be untrue, to be incredible, to be a lie, feel free to disregard the entirety of that witness\u2019s testimony,\u2019\u201d Randy Zelin, a trial attorney and adjunct professor at Cornell Law School, said on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d on Friday. Trump\u2019s lawyers need to create reasonable doubt in the minds of just one juror to open the possibility of a hung jury or an acquittal. Questions mount over scope of defense case Scrutiny of Cohen\u2019s testimony was the latest twist in the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s multifront legal saga, which includes three other criminal indictments and has meant the path to the 2024 election has run more through the courts than the campaign trail. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him \u2014 in two cases related to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and one over his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. And he\u2019s rooted his bid to reclaim the White House in claims of political persecution. There is no evidence that Trump is the victim of a coordinated attempt by President Joe Biden to weaponize the justice system against his rival, despite such claims by a parade of Republican lawmakers flocking to the Manhattan court in recent days. The most prominent visitor was House Speaker Mike Johnson, who brought the symbolism of his office to bear in an extraordinary attack on the judge and the case. The Louisiana Republican also attempted to discredit Cohen, joining fellow Republicans in bolstering Trump\u2019s own attacks after the judge threatened the ex-president with jail if he continued to infringe on a limited gag order. With the end of Cohen\u2019s testimony looming, there is uncertainty over the extent of Trump\u2019s defense case. His attorneys have said they may call at least one witness \u2014 Bradley Smith, a former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission. Judge Juan Merchan indicated Thursday that he was reluctant to change limits he has already placed on the scope of any such testimony. Merchan has ruled Smith could discuss the role and function of the FEC and define certain terms related to campaign finance but cannot say whether the law was violated in this case. The greatest unknown \u2014 apart from the verdict \u2014 is whether Trump will take the stand There are many reasons why testimony from the accused is often viewed as risky for the defense in any case. But when the defendant is as difficult to control and prone to assaulting the truth as the former president, the stakes are even higher. Trump initially said he would testify \u2014 as he often threatens to do in his legal dramas \u2014 but then appeared to backtrack by falsely claiming a gag order in the case designed to protect witnesses and court staff meant he could not. Blanche referred to the possibility of Trump\u2019s testimony on Thursday, the last day the court was in session. \u201cThat\u2019s another decision that we need to think through,\u201d Blanche said. After days on the defensive, Trump\u2019s attorneys may have finally succeeded in making the credibility of Cohen an important factor in the trial last week. But an appearance by Trump could be a massive distraction from Cohen\u2019s problems. It could also open up the former president to being probed on inconsistencies in his own story. And Trump may be asked about details of the alleged liaison with Daniels in Lake Tahoe in 2006 that he denies took place. Trump has often left no doubt that he considers himself his own best advocate. Throughout his business career and political life, he has been notoriously impossible for subordinates to control. During this trial, he has used breaks in courtroom action to address reporters to shape public perceptions of the case because there are no television cameras in court. The temptation to take the most critical turn in his own trial \u2014 and to try to create even more of a political circus than he has already \u2014 may be irresistible. Trump did take the stand in a civil fraud case against him, his adult sons, and his business organization in November. The judge in that trial, Arthur Engoron, tried initially to keep Trump under control, but the testimony soon turned into a replica of the ex-president\u2019s unchained campaign trial rhetoric, much to the judge\u2019s frustration. And Trump\u2019s histrionics appear to have harmed him as Engoron wrote in a civil judgment against Trump worth nearly half a billion dollars that the ex-president and his sons showed a complete lack of contrition and remorse for massive frauds that bordered on the \u201cpathological.\u201d The critical difference in the hush money criminal case is that it will be adjudicated by a jury and not a judge. After the defense case wraps up, the prosecution has a chance to put on its own rebuttal. Next come the summations of the case from prosecutors and the defense \u2014 a process Merchan said he hopes to begin as early as Tuesday. Then, the lawyers leave the stage, and the judge instructs members of the jury on the law they must apply in their deliberations. It is at that point, when the jurors retire to consider their verdict, that the country will be in suspense, waiting for the unprecedented moment when it will learn whether, for the first time, a former president will be convicted of a crime.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-trump-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_border-bill-vote-cory-booker-senate", "text": "A White House-backed effort to vote on a border security package in the Senate was dealt a blow when Sen. Cory Booker said he would not support the legislation, a move that shows Democrats are losing support within their ranks even as they try to shift blame to Republicans. Prior to Booker\u2019s announcement, the bill, which hits the Senate floor on Thursday, had not been expected to pass due to GOP opposition and Democratic divisions. Democrats are pushing a vote in an effort to put pressure on Republicans and argue that the GOP won\u2019t act on the border, a key issue in an election year. But Booker\u2019s announcement brings attention to the divides within the Democratic Party over the hot-button issue, and any further Democratic defections could complicate, or undermine, the messaging effort by the party. \u201cIn February, I voted to advance the bipartisan immigration deal to emphasize my commitment to continued debate on solving the challenges at the border, despite my serious concerns with some of the substance of the underlying legislation,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cI will not vote for the bill coming to the Senate floor this week because it includes several provisions that will violate Americans\u2019 shared values.\u201d The initial bill from February, which was part of a broader bipartisan package that included foreign aid to US allies, failed 49 to 50 during a procedural vote after facing a torrent of attacks by top House Republicans and former President Donald Trump. At least 60 votes were needed to break the GOP filibuster and move the legislation ahead. The \u201cno\u201d votes included Democratic Sens. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Independent who caucuses with Democrats, also opposed the measure. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no in a move that would allow him to make a procedural maneuver in the future to bring it back up. Booker noted in his statement that he supported the original bill because it also provided \u201ccritical foreign and humanitarian aid,\u201d a provision that doesn\u2019t exist in the current bill because Congress moved separately to pass a foreign aid package without border provisions. The Biden administration also faced a blow on Tuesday when the Senate approved a measure to roll back energy efficiency standards for residential gas\u00a0furnaces. The energy standards are part of the White House\u2019s efforts to combat climate change, but\u00a0Republicans argued that the rules were too stringent and would be costly to consumers. The Energy Department rule, which went into effect in February, would require manufacturers to build\u00a0furnaces\u00a0that convert 95% of their fuel to heat.\u00a0Democrats, such as Markey, fiercely defended the rule as a critically needed update that would spur innovation and help the environment. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who sponsored the measure, argued the new rule would impact the majority of American households who would have to pay thousands of dollars for new\u00a0furnaces. Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin and independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema voted\u00a0with Republicans in support of the measure, but with Biden expected to veto it, it\u2019s unlikely to get the necessary two-thirds majority in each chamber to override the veto.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_nikki-haley-donald-trump", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley plans to vote for Donald Trump, she said Wednesday in her first public remarks since exiting the Republican presidential primary more than two months ago. Haley said Trump \u201chas not been perfect\u201d on policies important to her, including foreign policy, immigration and the economy, but President Joe Biden \u201chas been a catastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under the former president. Haley\u2019s remarks about the 2024 race came during a Q&A session following a speech at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, DC, where she now serves as the Walter P. Stern chair. Haley said she has \u201cno regrets\u201d about her GOP primary bid: \u201cWe left it all on the field.\u201d She also thanked the primary voters who have continued to back her even after her departure from the race \u2014 a potential warning sign for Trump. And she reiterated the call she\u2019d made when exiting the race in March for the former president to reach out to those voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d Haley said. Earlier this year, Haley and Trump were engaged in what had become a bitter primary feud.  Haley, at one point, questioned the former president\u2019s mental fitness. She told CNN in January that Trump and Biden were \u201cequally bad.\u201d Her critiques of Trump during the primary grew even sharper after the former president mocked the absence of her deployed husband and called for all of her donors to be \u201cpermanently barred from the MAGA camp.\u201d \u201cIn that moment, he showed that with that kind of disrespect for the military, he\u2019s not qualified to be the president of the United States, because I don\u2019t trust him to protect them,\u201d Haley said in February. Then, days before dropping out, she said she no longer believed she was bound by the Republican National Committee pledge to support the party\u2019s eventual presidential nominee. \u2018Dangerous worldview\u2019 As she ventured back onto the political stage Wednesday, after two months out of public view, Haley didn\u2019t mention Trump in her Hudson Institute speech \u2014 only addressing the former president when asked about him afterward. \u201cA dangerous worldview has risen on both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said in her remarks. \u201cOnce again, it threatens our prosperity and security. We need to take this seriously.\u201d She offered full support for Israel\u2019s war with Hamas and strongly criticized Biden for placing conditions on military aid to the country. \u201cBiden thinks he\u2019s stopping a war,\u201d Haley said. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s dragging out a war, emboldening terrorists and making other wars more likely.\u201d She was also critical of her fellow Republicans, urging the party to support military aid for Ukraine and Israel. But she did not criticize GOP members by name and praised House Speaker Mike Johnson for the recent passage of a military aid package. \u201cSending weapons to Ukraine and Israel isn\u2019t foreign aid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an investment in a world in which authoritarian dictators cannot run roughshod over free countries.\u201d Since leaving the race in March, the former South Carolina governor has spent time reconnecting with her family, aides say, including her husband, Michael, who returned from a yearlong overseas deployment. Yet even in her absence, she\u2019s been winning votes in one Republican primary after another. Her lingering support has exposed a potential challenge Trump faces to unifty the party in suburban areas of swing states \u2013 such as outside Philadelphia, where Haley received nearly 25% of the vote in both Chester and Montgomery counties. While Trump has not extended an olive branch to Haley or her supporters, the Biden campaign has closely studied the Republican primary results, aides say, even in deep-red states such as Indiana, where Haley received about 22% of the vote earlier this month. The Biden campaign has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. \u201cThe campaign has the opportunity to target and engage high-information Republican voters like Nikki Haley supporters or other voters who voted for Donald Trump in \u201920, but voted for Democratic candidates in \u201822 across battleground states,\u201d a top Biden adviser told CNN. The Biden campaign argued Wednesday that Haley\u2019s backing of Trump doesn\u2019t change the choice before voters. \u201cNothing has changed for the millions of Republican voters who continue to cast their ballots against Donald Trump in the primaries and care deeply about the future of our democracy, standing strong with our allies against foreign adversaries, and working across the aisle to get things done for the American people \u2013 while also rejecting the chaos, division and violence that Donald Trump embodies,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. \u201cOnly one candidate shares those values, and only one campaign is working hard every day to earn their support \u2013 and that\u2019s President Biden\u2019s.\u201d It\u2019s an open question how many of those voters backing Haley in primary contests are lodging a temporary protest against Trump or actually open to supporting Biden. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed Haley in the primary before switching his support to Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket. \u201cFor Nikki Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President Trump and also to Nikki Haley.\u201d Norman said that while Haley has not expressed interest in joining Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would be interested. \u201cPolitics is an interesting game. People can forget the past and look forward to the future,\u201d Norman said. For his part, Trump has said Haley \u201cis not under consideration\u201d but said he wished her well.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trump-cohen-costello-drama-analysis", "text": "Twelve New Yorkers are on deck. As Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial races toward its climax, his attorneys are previewing how they will beseech a jury next week to spare their client the shame of being the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. On a wild day in court Monday, Judge Juan Merchan accused one disrespectful defense witness of trying to stare him down, while the ex-president\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen, sensationally admitted to stealing thousands of dollars from his old boss\u2019 firm. But beneath the uproar, there is also a clear sense that this trial \u2013 which is intertwined with the country\u2019s future, given Trump\u2019s bid to reclaim the White House \u2013 is now in its fateful endgame. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s lawyers made a long-shot bid for the dismissal of his first criminal trial before the jury has even been asked to deliberate. The gambit is a familiar one for defense teams that rarely works, but it offered a glimpse into the narrative Trump\u2019s lawyers will place before the jury, likely next Tuesday, after the Memorial Day holiday. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, argued prosecutors had failed to prove their case that Trump intended to mislead voters in 2016 by falsifying financial records to disguise a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. And he implored Merchan not to hand jurors a case so reliant on testimony from Cohen, a confessed liar. With the jury out of the room, Merchan took several stabs at getting it straight. He said: \u201cYou want me to take it out of the jury\u2019s hands and decide before it even gets to the jury, that as a matter of law, this person is so not worthy of belief that it shouldn\u2019t be considered by the jury?\u201d Blanche replied: \u201cWe didn\u2019t just catch him in a lie, your honor, he came in here with a history of lying.\u201d The judge hardly seemed impressed. \u201cYou said his lies are \u2018irrefutable\u2019; that you think he\u2019s going to fool 12 New Yorkers into believing this lie?\u201d Merchan said. Blanche answered: \u201cI certainly hope he doesn\u2019t convince 12 jurors.\u201d The judge said he\u2019d consider the request, but it would be a major surprise if anything now happens to prevent the jury from getting the case. Trump cranks up his strategy to discredit the trial before a verdict Trump, meanwhile, escalated his inside-outside courtroom strategy that has turned his four criminal indictments into a rationale for his bid to win back the White House. He lashed out at Merchan in the corridor while surrounded by another posse of Republican Party supplicants. \u201cThis case should be dropped by the judge. I think the judge, if he did that, would gain the respect back,\u201d Trump said, insisting \u201cthere was no crime\u201d and again complaining about a courtroom he called a \u201cfreezing cold ice box.\u201d Trump has denied the affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case, as he has in all others against him. The prosecution rested its case Monday, after trying to rehabilitate the sometimes rocky testimony of Cohen, the self-described former Trump \u201cthug\u201d who once wrote that he knew where the ex-president\u2019s skeletons were buried because he did the burying. Barring an 11th hour change of heart, it appears that the former president himself won\u2019t testify in his own defense \u2014 in what would be a sound legal decision as he\u2019d almost certain make the case all about himself again after his lawyers spent days trying to make it about Cohen\u2019s questionable credibility. Key developments Monday\u2019s court action at times threatened to spin out of control \u2014 in a way that only a Trump trial can. But several key developments underscored the way the case is headed inexorably toward a jury deliberation that will keep the country on edge. The prosecution\u2019s main task was to try to repair damage to Cohen\u2019s credibility and to stress to the jury \u2014 and to the judge in the back-and-forth over the motion to dismiss \u2014 that the case was about far more than Trump\u2019s former fixer. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued that the foundation of evidence presented in court before Cohen\u2019s testimony corroborated what he had to say. Colangelo said that \u201cat minimum, a reasonable juror could conclude the invoices, the ledger entries, the signed checks with check stubs \u2014 all contain false information.\u201d And he argued there was an \u201coverwhelming record of concealment\u201d that supports an intent to defraud on Trump\u2019s part. Until Cohen entered a bruising cross-examination last week, the case appeared to be going well for the prosecution. But the witness who was always a big risk turned into a potentially case-derailing disaster. He was confronted with evidence that called into question his testimony under oath about speaking with Trump on October 24, 2016, to tell him the hush money payment scheme was going according to plan. The defense presented Cohen with text messages he had sent to Trump\u2019s bodyguard Keith Schiller, who was with Trump at the time,\u00a0just before the call, suggesting the conversation was about an entirely different matter. The implication was that Cohen didn\u2019t speak to Trump about the hush money payment, raising questions about his fixer\u2019s truthfulness. The defense is implying that if Cohen cannot be trusted on this detail, his entire testimony implicating Trump cannot be believed. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger on Monday tried to clean up some of Cohen\u2019s mess. \u201cI know it may feel like you\u2019re on trial here after cross-examination, but are you actually on trial?\u201d she asked Cohen. \u201cNo ma\u2019am,\u201d said the man who once said he idolized Trump. But Cohen may have further damaged his standing with jurors earlier in the day when he admitted that he stole $60,000 from the Trump Organization. His admission, about a cut he took from a payment to a tech company and a subsequent reimbursement with interest from his boss\u2019 firm, caused Blanche to ask: \u201cDid you ever have to plead guilty to larceny?\u201d which drew a smirk from Trump. Some legal commentators suggested this episode was another bombshell shattering  Cohen\u2019s credibility. But others argued that it was just another data point for jurors who would have few illusions about Cohen\u2019s character after he admitted to repeatedly lying on his own and Trump\u2019s account. \u201cWhat is portrayed in the media is not what the jurors are ever going to see if they are following the judge\u2019s instructions not to look at any stories on TV or read anything about this. It\u2019s another piece of information for them to consider,\u201d retired judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Courtroom chaos Veteran lawyers and court reporters said they\u2019d never seen anything like the scene precipitated by defense witness Robert Costello. The lawyer who had advised Cohen was called to the stand to testify for the defense, but it didn\u2019t take long for him to get on the wrong side of Merchan. When the judge sustained an objection to a defense question, Costello let out an audible \u201cjeez,\u201d prompting the judge to lean forward and say, \u201cSorry?\u201d Costello\u2019s disdain was evident again when the same thing happened shortly afterward and the judge asked the jury to leave the courtroom. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a side eye and you don\u2019t roll your eyes,\u201d the judge warned. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a witness on the stand, if you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019 you don\u2019t say strike it,\u201d Merchan said. Costello replied with a glare. \u201cAre you staring me down?\u201d Merchan asked before clearing the courtroom. Costello\u2019s behavior was a stunning show of disrespect for a judge in his own courtroom \u2014 and the first part of it was visible to jurors. \u201cI don\u2019t think this witness really helped this defense at all,\u201d Cordell told Tapper. \u201cMy guess, maybe they called this witness because their client wanted them to do that. He really didn\u2019t add anything and really created more of a problem than a help,\u201d she said. Predictably, the ultimate chaos agent enjoyed the disruption. Trump told reporters after court wrapped for the day: \u201cYou saw what happened to a highly respected lawyer today, Bob Costello. Wow. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d Former long-time trial attorney Terri Austin agreed. \u201cIn all my years of practice, over 30 plus, I\u2019ve never seen a moment like this,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. It\u2019s a superlative worn out by repetition ever since Trump descended the golden escalator in 2015 at his eponymous skyscraper not far from the Manhattan courtroom. And whatever happens in the coming days, we\u2019ll likely hear it again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-cohen-costello-drama-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_mar-a-lago-documents-walt-nauta-donald-trump", "text": "Months before Donald Trump was indicted for mishandling classified documents, a federal judge said that investigators had \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the former president \u201cintended\u201d to hide classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago\u00a0resort, according to newly released court documents. Judge Beryl Howell cited, among other things, the discovery of additional\u00a0classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago months after the FBI\u2019s search of the property in the summer of 2022. The records included a\u00a0\u201cmostly empty\u201d folder marked as\u00a0\u201cClassified Evening Summary\u201d that was found in the former president\u2019s bedroom, as well as four other documents with classification markings found in his post-presidential office at the resort. \u201cNotably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Howell\u00a0wrote in March 2023. The ruling was among hundreds of pages of previously sealed filings that were publicly docketed Tuesday in the criminal classified documents case against Trump. Included as well were new images of Walt Nauta, Trump\u2019s personal aide, moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago room before the a Trump attorney was to review the boxes for classified materials sought by a subpoena. Prosecutors say\u00a0Nauta moved boxes around as part of an alleged conspiracy to conceal classified material from federal investigators. Nauta has been charged alongside Trump and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira in the case, facing charges of mishandling sensitive or classified materials and obstruction.\u00a0 All three have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. The photos of Nauta, which appear to be screenshots of surveillance footage, are dated June 1, 2022 \u2013 shortly before the Trump attorney was slated to canvass the storage room for any documents with classified markings to be returned to the federal government. The case against Trump, brought last summer, is currently in front of Judge Aileen Cannon in Fort Pierce, Florida. Cannon is a Trump appointee. Judge said that Trump used his attorney as a \u2018front man\u2019 to obstruct probe Trump\u2019s defense team is seeking to throw out parts of the prosecutors\u2019 case \u2013 including all the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and obtained from his former attorney Evan Corcoran, according to the filings in federal court in South Florida. Trump\u2019s team argues that the warrant for the search wasn\u2019t valid because of the way an FBI agent described the agency\u2019s thinking to a magistrate judge. They are also contesting Howell\u2019s 2023 ruling ordering\u00a0Corcoran to provide testimony and produce documents that he had previously withheld from the grand jury investigating the matter. Howell, an appointee of Barack Obama, said at the time that prosecutors had\u00a0\u201csufficient evidence to show that the former president\u201d used Corcoran as \u201ca \u2018front m[a]n\u2019 to obstruct the government\u2019s investigation and perpetuate the former president\u2019s unlawful retention of any classified documents contained in boxes transferred from the White House.\u201d Corcoran played a pivotal role in the investigation into the classified documents, as he was the attorney who was tasked with finding and producing documents with classified markings at Trump\u2019s Florida resort. In the criminal case filed last year, prosecutors say there was conspiracy led by Trump to move boxes of government records from the storage room before Corcoran searched for it for classified materials. Corcoran is referred to as \u201cPerson 18\u201d in Howell\u2019s ruling but can be identified based on what\u2019s known about the case. Among the topics Howell ordered Corcoran to testify about was a June 24, 2022, phone call he had with Trump \u2013 the same day investigators subpoenaed surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0She also ordered the production of 88 documents that had been withheld under attorney-client privilege. Howell\u00a0recounted Trump\u2019s actions over the course of several months while the federal government sought to retrieve the sensitive documents taken from the\u00a0White House. Trump \u201cdeliberately curtailed his staff\u2019s efforts to comply\u201d with the National Archives\u2019\u00a0initial efforts to retrieve the documents, she wrote. \u201cThe former president\u2019s misdirection of NARA was apparently a dress rehearsal for his actions in response to the May 11, 2022 subpoena,\u201d Howell said. Twenty-one of the 32 national security documents Trump is accused of criminally mishandling were in the former president\u2019s possession August 8, 2022, the date of the Mar-a-Lago FBI search. That means that Trump\u2019s team in this newly available motion to suppress is seeking to cut out from the case those 21 documents\u2013and thus their related charges\u2013and the hundreds of other classified records around them, plus the part of the case accusing Trump of obstruction of justice that is built around Corcoran. Guidelines for FBI\u2019s search at Mar-a-Lago unsealed Also unsealed Tuesday was a law enforcement document outlining how the FBI was authorized to search Mar-a-Lago. The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. Though the language is standard and directly from the department\u2019s manual, Trump quickly took to social media Tuesday to decry the 2022 document as having \u201cauthorized\u201d deadly force. \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\u201d Trump said in a\u00a0post on Truth Social. \u201cNOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d \u201cThe FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. Much of the plan includes traditional practices by the FBI when executing a warrant \u2013 like how agents are required to have their standard issued weapon, ammunition and credentials while on duty. Other parts, however, show the lengths that the bureau went to to accommodate the former president, including instructions for commanding agents to wear \u201cunmarked polo or collared shirts\u201d and to keep their \u201claw enforcement equipment concealed,\u201d as well as references to their efforts to coordinate with US Secret Service to create a smooth process for entering the Florida club.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_sources-say-they-were-duped-by-egypt-changing-ceasefire-terms-for-hamas", "text": "Egyptian intelligence quietly changed the terms of a ceasefire\u00a0proposal that Israel had already signed off on earlier this month, ultimately scuttling a deal that could have released Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and set a pathway to temporarily end the fighting in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The\u00a0ceasefire agreement\u00a0that Hamas\u00a0ended up announcing on May 6 was not what the Qataris or the Americans believed had been submitted to Hamas for\u00a0a potential final review, the sources said. The changes made by Egyptian intelligence, the details of which have not been previously reported, led to a wave of\u00a0anger and recrimination among officials from the US, Qatar and Israel, and left ceasefire talks at an impasse. \u201cWe were all duped,\u201d\u00a0one of those sources\u00a0told CNN. CIA Director Bill\u00a0Burns,\u00a0who\u00a0has spearheaded the American efforts to broker\u00a0a\u00a0ceasefire agreement, was in the region when word reached him that the Egyptians had changed the terms of the deal. Burns was angry and embarrassed,\u00a0the same person said, believing it made him look like he wasn\u2019t in the loop or hadn\u2019t informed the Israelis of the changes. The soft-spoken and mild-mannered Burns \u201calmost blew a gasket,\u201d\u00a0said the source. A CIA spokesperson declined to comment. The three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that a senior Egyptian intelligence official named Ahmed Abdel Khalek was responsible for making the changes. Abdel Khalek is a senior deputy to the Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel,\u00a0who has been Burns\u2019 counterpart in leading Egypt\u2019s mediation in the ceasefire talks. One\u00a0source\u00a0familiar with the negotiations said Abdel Khalek told the Israelis one thing and Hamas another. More of Hamas\u2019 demands were inserted into\u00a0the original framework that Israel had tacitly agreed to in order to secure Hamas\u2019 approval, the source said.\u00a0But the other mediators were not informed; nor, critically, were the Israelis. \u201cHamas was telling their people,\u00a0\u2018We will have a deal in place tomorrow,\u2019\u201d the first source said. \u201cAll sides were under the assumption the Egyptians provided the same document\u201d that Israel had signed off on and the other mediators, the US and Qatar, were aware of,\u00a0the person said. Instead, the second source said, the Egyptians sought to blur the lines between the original framework and Hamas\u2019s response. In response to a request for comment from the Egyptian government, a senior Egyptian source told CNN after the story was published:\u00a0\u201cSome parties play a game of accusing the mediators, blaming and accusing them of bias in order to evade making the required decisions. Egypt is surprised by the attempts of some parties to deliberately insult the Egyptian efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.\u201d Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt\u2019s State Information Services, then issued a lengthy\u00a0response\u00a0calling the story \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cdevoid of any information or facts,\u201d without offering specifics. \u201cThe ongoing attempts to cast doubt and insult the Egyptian mediation efforts and roles, with allegations that contradict reality, will only lead to further complicating the situation in Gaza and the entire region, and may push the Egyptian side to take a decision to withdraw completely from their mediation role in the current conflict,\u201d Rashwan said in a statement. A deal was close at hand A Hamas document obtained by CNN outlining the version of the framework they agreed to included achieving a permanent ceasefire and a \u201csustainable calm\u201d to be reached in the second phase of the three-stage deal. Israel has been averse to agreeing to discuss an end to the war before Hamas has been defeated and the remaining hostages are released from captivity. Now,\u00a0three\u00a0weeks later, with ceasefire talks stalled, those involved are raising questions about the motives of Egypt, which\u00a0for years\u00a0has served as a key intermediary between\u00a0Israel\u00a0and Hamas, particularly Hamas members inside Gaza. Asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday if he was concerned about Egypt being involved with future ceasefire talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel was not prepared to agree to terms that would allow Hamas to attack Israel again. \u201cI hope Egypt understands that we can\u2019t agree to something like that.\u201d The changes\u00a0came\u00a0more than a week\u00a0after a team of Egyptian negotiators flew to Israel in late April to hammer out\u00a0some of\u00a0the final details of a framework to provide for the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for a pause in fighting and the return of Palestinian prisoners. Talks had been ongoing for months by then,\u00a0since the last pause in the fighting fell apart in early December. With Israel agreeing for the most part to go farther than they previously had, there was a creeping sense of optimism taking hold that a deal was close at hand.\u00a0Israel appeared willing to accept fewer hostages, release more Palestinian prisoners and allow Gazans in the southern part of the enclave to return home to the north unrestricted. US officials emphasized how \u201cextraordinarily\u00a0generous on the part of Israel\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0framework was, in the words of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. After discovering the Egyptian freelancing, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani informed Israel\u2019s intelligence service Mossad that Egypt had acted alone,\u00a0two of the\u00a0sources told CNN. Al Thani and\u00a0CIA Director\u00a0Burns got to work trying to salvage the proposal and re-balance it with elements they knew Israel would require. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d\u00a0a\u00a0senior Biden administration official said of why Egyptian intelligence would try to push something through without the essential input from the others. Changes made to appeal to Hamas After the Egyptians came back from Israel and conferred with Hamas, it became clear the group wouldn\u2019t go along with what Israel was agreeing to, one of the sources said. So the Egyptian official made significant changes to get Hamas to agree. The day before Hamas made their May 6 public announcement agreeing to the proposal, an Egyptian source told CNN that Egypt had\u00a0received Hamas\u2019 response and relayed it to the Israeli side. \u201cSeveral alternatives and scenarios were proposed to overcome the main point of contention related to ending the war,\u201d said the source. The agreement\u2019s language about ending the war has been perhaps the thorniest issue throughout the negotiations. But what Hamas sent back, Netanyahu said, \u201cwas very far from Israel\u2019s core demands.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before the discussions stalled. Negotiators, including Burns, returned to Cairo for one more round of indirect talks with Hamas. Israel agreed to send a team, as did Qatar, but neither sent senior officials, an indication that despite earlier optimism a deal would not be as imminent as hoped. Two days after Hamas\u2019 response on May 6, Burns returned to Washington and sources told CNN the talks were \u201cpaused.\u201d Mediators had hoped that a pause in the fighting would delay or even prevent a serious incursion into Rafah by Israel. Military operations by Israel in Rafah are now expanding despite protest by the Biden administration that they will threaten the hundreds of thousands of civilians who had fled there for safety. If talks resume, it\u2019s expected that the Qataris would play a bigger role in the next round, the second source familiar with the negotiations said.\u00a0A re-launch of the negotiations does not appear imminent but if it were to happen Egypt would still be expected to be central given their essential proximity to Hamas, as well as Israel\u2019s preference of Egypt to Qatar. The discussions would still be expected to center\u00a0on\u00a0a broad framework that would include an initial stage in which up to 33 Israeli hostages would be released over at least 6 weeks. Hamas has been pushing to include the bodies of dead hostages in the initial release and also have the first phase flow into a second with no break. Both are positions Israel has resisted. US officials have argued that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar doesn\u2019t actually want a deal since he may think he\u2019s winning and the greater the Palestinian suffering the more the world turns on Israel. Critics of Netanyahu, including families of Israeli hostages, have accused him of being more concerned with removing Hamas from Gaza than getting his citizens home. This story has been updated with comments from Netanyahu and a response from the Egyptian government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/sources-say-they-were-duped-by-egypt-changing-ceasefire-terms-for-hamas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_iranian-foreign-minister-ali-bagheri-kani", "text": "Within days of the helicopter crash that killed its president and other top officials, Iran detailed a succession plan and named replacements in a clear effort to project stability at a moment of profound and sudden uncertainty within the regime. One familiar name stood out to US officials: the new acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani. Seen\u00a0by US officials as a hardline establishment figure,\u00a0Kani\u00a0has\u00a0been a top negotiator for Iran on sensitive talks with the United States on everything from nuclear issues to its use of proxy forces to attack US and allied interests across the region. Just last week in Oman, Kani was part of a delegation of senior\u00a0Iranian\u00a0officials that met indirectly with US officials, current and former officials said. Because the US and Iran do not have formal diplomatic relations, the two delegations sat in separate rooms while Omani officials passed back and forth messages. Kani, US officials said, is a known quantity\u00a0and\u00a0one\u00a0example of\u00a0why the Biden administration largely expects little\u00a0to change in Iran\u00a0following the\u00a0sudden\u00a0deaths of its president and top officials. For hours on Sunday after the US received the first reports that a helicopter had crashed while carrying some of\u00a0Iran\u2019s\u00a0most senior\u00a0leaders, including President Ebrahim\u00a0Raisi, US officials weren\u2019t sure how bad the accident was. But even once it became clear that\u00a0Raisi\u00a0and the others aboard had\u00a0perished, the consensus view across the US government was that Iran\u2019s foreign and domestic policy were likely to remain consistent. That\u2019s because Iran\u2019s true leader is its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\u00a0Raisi\u00a0was, in many ways, a functionary. He had \u201cinfluence and impact,\u201d according to Jonathan\u00a0Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region, \u201cbut ultimate decision-making authority on every issue is solely held and consolidated by the Supreme Leader.\u201d Khamenei,\u00a085,\u00a0has been in frail health and has been watched closely. In the wake of the death of so many of his top officials, US officials believe that Khamenei will work to ensure that replacements adhere to his hardline worldview. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see there will be any major changes in the way Iran behaves on the world stage,\u201d a senior administration official said. If anything,\u00a0Panikoff\u00a0said, the death of\u00a0Raisi\u00a0and its other top leaders may make Iran more risk-averse in the short term. The senior administration official cautioned that it is still too soon to\u00a0know for sure how the crash might ultimately affect overall regional volatility, including\u00a0Iran\u2019s handling of the Gaza conflict. But for now, the Biden administration believes that there will be little impact. Impact on succession plan Raisi\u00a0was widely seen as a possible successor to Khamenei,\u00a0and his death has sparked a spirited debate in Washington intelligence and policy circles over how it will jumble the field. The Supreme Leader is chosen by an opaque group known as the Assembly of Experts. Some analysts believe that Khamenei\u2019s son may now have a better chance of succeeding his father, although he may lack critical religious credentials the role requires. But analysts say it\u2019s impossible to assess how that mysterious election process will play out and whether the crash has improved the chances of Khamenei\u2019s son. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably true if the Ayatollah dies in the next month,\u201d said\u00a0Panikoff. \u201cI think it may not be as true if it\u2019s still another two or three years and other people have surfaced and come into the system.\u201d Raisi\u2019s\u00a0death may also offer a small window for domestic protest. According to the Iranian constitution, elections must be held to name a new president within 50 days of\u00a0Raisi\u2019s\u00a0death. The Iranian regime has struggled with popular support;\u00a0Raisi\u00a0was known as \u201cthe butcher of Tehran\u201d and already a meme has circulated\u00a0within Iran\u00a0celebrating his death. Analysts say the regime will seek to tightly control who can run, deepening the public perception that elections are neither free nor fair. But Iranian authorities will almost certainly crack down on any nascent protests, analysts say. Parliamentary elections in March of this year had an historically low turnout rate \u2014\u00a0a signal of discontent with the regime and a worrying sign for regime leaders,\u00a0but not one most analysts believe will translate into meaningful or successful grassroots protest. Impact on proxy activity The sudden shakeup in Iran\u2019s leadership structure has taken place as Tehran has been deeply involved in the tense regional imbroglio surrounding Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. Iran has offered support to a series of proxies launching attacks on US and Israeli interests in the region and in April, it launched a large-scale missile and drone attack directly on Israel. US officials have long believed that Iran is seeking to calibrate its handling of the simmering, multiprong conflict, extracting costs from its adversaries but avoiding an all-out direct conflict with Israel or the United States. So far, it has been successful. A US military official said they have seen no uptick in proxy activity in the wake of the crash. Importantly, the military official said, the death of\u00a0Raisi\u00a0and the elevation of\u00a0Kani\u00a0to the role of foreign minister has also not opened any sudden opportunities for the United States when it comes to dealing with Iran. The same toxic issues \u2014\u00a0including Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014\u00a0remain intractable problems. In\u00a0talks with Iranian officials in\u00a0Oman last week, US officials once again laid out for their counterparts\u00a0the consequences of Iran\u2019s destabilizing actions, behavior and policies, according to the senior administration official and a US official. The Biden administration\u2019s view has been that having zero contact with Iran would heighten the risk of dangerous miscalculation,\u00a0officials told CNN, adding that the US will continue to deploy a mix of deterrence and diplomacy \u2013 like last week\u2019s talks \u2013 to manage Iran.\u00a0Issues like Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, it\u2019s various proxy groups and its nuclear program were all topics of discussion last week. The two sides have communicated in this\u00a0indirect\u00a0manner multiple times since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October. Last week was the first meeting of this kind in several months. But in the aftermath of the crash, Iran asked for US help in recovery efforts. The US, according to State Department spokesman Matt Miller, was unable to help \u201clargely for logistical reasons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/iranian-foreign-minister-ali-bagheri-kani/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_04_13_politics_questions-trump-trial-answered-what-matters", "text": "When CNN asked for your questions about former President Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial \u2013 for his role in hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women who said they had affairs with him \u2013 we got a flood of input. Not all of it was fit to print. But there were a lot of legitimate and very thoughtful questions, which we\u2019ve updated now that the defense and prosecution have both rested and jurors may begin deliberations as soon as May 28. Keep reading for a representative sampling, which helps explain the case, along with context from CNN\u2019s reporters and coverage. Most of the questions come directly from reader submissions, but for others, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of simplifying multiple submissions into one question. Trump, by the way, denies having the affairs and has pleaded not guilty in the case. I went to CNN\u2019s chief legal analyst Laura Coates for the single, most-asked question, which was asked in many ways but boils down to: Could Trump actually go to jail? Coates: If Trump were to be found guilty of all of the counts, he could theoretically be facing more than a decade in prison.\u00a0The 34 felony counts are classified as Class E felonies in New York, the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty for each of those counts is four years; however New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years.\u00a0It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to decide whether those sentences would run concurrently or consecutively. Because the crimes involve nonviolent offenses and Trump does not have a criminal record, the judge could also consider jailing him for a period that is but a fraction of the maximum penalty. Another possibility is that the judge could forego prison entirely and place him on probation with the possibility of incarceration looming over his head if he fails to abide by the conditions set by the judge. If the judge should decide to incarcerate post-conviction, Secret Service would become the elephant in the, well, cell.\u00a0The unprecedented nature of incarcerating a former president would raise questions about how best to ensure equal treatment under the law and security for a former president. Watch Coates\u2019 show weeknights at 11 p.m. ET where she\u2019ll answer a lot more of your questions. I reached out to the Secret Service to ask if they had planned for the potential that Trump could be imprisoned. Not surprisingly, I was told by a spokesman that this is \u201csomething we can not comment on at this time.\u201d But note that as a matter of US law, former presidents and their spouses are afforded lifetime Secret Service protection, unless they decline it. This is ultimately a question of strategy. But testimony in previous proceedings has not gone well for Weisselberg, the former, longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. He is currently indisposed at Rikers Island, a prison in New York, where he\u2019s serving time for admitting to perjury in the civil fraud trial that ended in a more than $400 million judgement against Trump for inflating his net worth to get friendly loan terms. Prosecutors told Judge Juan Merchan they did not attempt to compel Weisselberg\u2019s testimony in this trial even though he played a crucial role in payments to Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen. Defense lawyers said Weisselberg was not available to either side for testimony and would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if called. Look for jurors to be given instructions about how to view testimony they heard about Weisselberg. There is strong evidence that the campaign was in a state of panic after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in 2016. There is strong evidence from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the desire to help Trump\u2019s campaign by finding and neutralizing damaging stories. It\u2019s clear that Cohen organized payments for Stormy Daniels, a woman who claimed an affair with Trump, and that he took out a loan to make them happen. But Cohen is the only witness who said that Trump specifically made payments to Cohen to reimburse him for the payments to Daniels. Jurors will have to believe Cohen, an admitted liar and felon, that the payments were improper reimbursement and not simply lawyer fees. A unanimous vote is required for either conviction or acquittal. Anything short of a unanimous verdict would be a hung jury. The judge will try very hard to get the jury to reach a unanimous verdict.  A hung jury might be perceived as a net win for Trump since prosecutors would have to ponder whether to try him again on the same charges and there\u2019s little chance it would happen before Election Day. The former first lady has not attended any of her husband\u2019s criminal trial, although many of Trump\u2019s political allies \u2013 senators, House members and more \u2013 have shown their support by attending some of the arguments. Trump\u2019s son with Melania, Barron Trump, graduated from high school in Florida during the trial and the judge canceled arguments that day so that the former president could attend the ceremony. Given that the trial included testimony from Daniels about her alleged affair \u2013 which Trump has denied \u2013 it is perhaps not surprising that Melania Trump would decide not to attend the proceedings. First, Trump never signed a check to Daniels, and that is a major element of the case. Cohen engineered the hush money payment when he could not get the National Enquirer to foot the bill. Cohen took out a line of credit on his apartment to come up with the cash. Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen after Trump won the White House were, according to Cohen, to pay him back for the Daniels payments, plus a bonus, and for other things like a bogus poll Cohen engineered. Second, Trump did claim to give up control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., when he was in the White House. But the arrangement was universally criticized by ethics experts. Trump maintained his ownership stake in the business. Some of his payments to Cohen were made from accounts associated with the trust set up to hold the Trump Organization while Trump was president. Other payments were made from a personal bank account, but all the payments were processed by the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors. Trump isn\u2019t technically accused of having an affair, which he denies and which is not illegal. The hush money itself, represented by a contract between two parties, is not necessarily illegal either. Hush money was paid by the Trump-supporting publisher of the National Enquirer to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and, separately, it was paid by Cohen to Daniels. But in this case, the payments, which were intended to hide details from voters before the 2016 election, violated campaign finance law. National Enquirer\u2019s parent company admitted wrongdoing, and Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign law and served time in prison. Federal prosecutors, as a matter of Department of Justice policy, were unable to prosecute Trump for the payments when he was president and decided not to bring charges after he left office. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg then brought this case. Trump is accused of falsifying business records (a New York state crime) in an effort to use illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 campaign (a federal crime). Yes. This is an important element of the case. Falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor. The felony charge here is falsifying business records to further another crime. And this is where the case against Trump gets unique. The other crime is a campaign finance violation to which Cohen has already pleaded guilty. It is a state crime made a felony by furthering a federal crime. Federal prosecutors, by the way, decided not to pursue charges against Trump with regard to the campaign finance violation. Jurors heard testimony about how nervous Trump\u2019s campaign was after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was published and they desperately wanted to tamp down on any unflattering stories. Trump\u2019s defense is that he did not want the Daniels story to be published because he wanted to keep the information from his wife. Nothing about any of this is normal. Trump\u2019s stated legal strategy is to delay legal proceedings as much as possible in the hope that they do not conclude before the presidential election. It\u2019s a strategy that so far is paying off in federal court. His federal election interference case is stalled until the US Supreme Court rules on what most people consider to be a ridiculous total immunity argument. His federal trial on classified documents is on indefinite hold in Miami. His trial in Fulton County, Georgia, on state election interference allegations has been delayed by allegations of impropriety in the personal life of the DA bringing the case. This is a great and essentially unanswerable hypothetical. First, it assumes multiple things will occur: Trump would have to be convicted, sentenced, exhaust appeals, report to prison and win the election. That\u2019s a very specific scenario thrust upon a very unpredictable set of circumstances and a short timeline. I talked to Frank Bowman, a law professor emeritus at the University of Missouri who is both an expert in criminal law and published a book on the impeachment process, for his thoughts on how to deal with a convict president. The Constitution, he said, theoretically allows a person to serve \u201ceven if he\u2019s a convicted felon or even if he\u2019s a convicted felon in the joint.\u201d Timing, however, would get in the way of this hypothetical ever occurring. \u201cThis stuff takes a long time, and the appeals would drag out,\u201d probably beyond Election Day and Inauguration Day, Bowman said. It\u2019s also possible Trump\u2019s opponents, after a conviction, could try again to either impeach him or object to his presidency based on the 14th Amendment, although those avenues have been tried and failed previously. If somehow Trump was convicted in this state case, Bowman imagined there could be some argument by which the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause \u2013 which prohibits states from interfering in the exercise of constitutional powers \u2013 could be utilized to keep Trump from state prison. But it would be a novel thing. If, on the other hand, Trump was somehow convicted in one of his two federal trials and sentenced to federal prison, as president he could theoretically try to pardon himself or order the Bureau of Prisons to do something like confine him at the White House. Again, this is uncharted territory that is unanticipated in US law and, Bowman argues, unlikely to occur.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trump-nazi-allusions-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump dabbles in Nazi allusions too often for it to be a coincidence. The latest example is a video posted on the ex-president\u2019s social media account that features a fake headline implying the US could become a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins a second term in November. The video replicates what appears to be World War I-era newspapers. But the term \u201cReich,\u201d which means a kind of empire, is also synonymous with the later Third Reich of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s campaign insisted the sharing of the third-party video on Monday was the work of a staffer and not Trump, who was in court. It was eventually taken down hours later on Tuesday. Trump may not have not been responsible for the post. But campaigns reflect the character of the candidate. And Trump has been flirting with Nazi imagery and giving comfort to far-right extremists for years. He recently accused President Joe Biden of running a \u201cGestapo\u201d administration. Trump has several times warned immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the United States, echoing language used by Hitler in his manifesto \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d which the ex-president claims he hasn\u2019t read. Back in 2017, Trump equivocated about condemning a White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which marchers chanted \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Trump also allegedly praised Hitler, according to former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was quoted by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto in his new book \u201cThe Return of Great Powers.\u201d Kelly commented: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, but Hitler did some good things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.\u2019\u201d Sciutto also cited Kelly as saying that Trump believed that Hitler\u2019s hold on senior Nazi officers displayed a loyalty he did not enjoy from his senior subordinates. When the book was published, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not comment on the substance of the allegations from Kelly and another former White House official, former national security advisor John Bolton. But he accused them both of \u201csuffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d In 2021, a Trump spokeswoman denied the former president had praised Hitler. Some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests an ignorance of history and his own self-obsession. But it must also be viewed in the context of a past and possibly future president who admires present day tyrants and dictators and has vowed to use the powers of the presidency to enact personal and political retribution. He\u2019s promising the biggest deportation operation in history to expel undocumented migrants. And his echoing of Nazi rhetoric on immigration has the same consequence as Hitler\u2019s \u2014 to demonize outsiders supposedly threatening the \u2018native\u2019 purity of the homeland. Trump has already tried to avoid leaving power after a democratic election he lost, whipping up his supporters ahead of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And over the weekend, he spitballed about potentially serving more than the two terms to which the Constitution says he can be elected.\u00a0Some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric seems designed to get a rise from his opponents and the media. But a strongman\u2019s aspirations lay behind it. And the searing demagoguery of his rallies increasingly resembles a tyrant\u2019s theatrics. Biden seized on the latest evidence of extremism in Trump\u2019s orbit by telling Democratic donors in Boston on Tuesday that \u201cthis is the same guy that uses Hitler\u2019s language, not America\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0He also used the furor to bolster his warnings that Trump\u2019s return to the White House would be a disaster for democracy. \u201cThe threat that Trump poses is greater in the second term than it was in the first.\u201d It\u2019s a good rule in politics that no one should use Nazi-themed rhetoric or allusions. Even Trump critics who portray him as an aspiring Nazi tyrant contribute to an erosion of the record about some of humanity\u2019s most heinous crimes. And as extreme as a second Trump term might be, the Nazi Germany comparison feels extreme. Analogies to the autocratic rule and democratic dismantling taking place under his friend, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, seem more on point. The casual proliferation of Nazi references is especially troubling at a moment when echoes of the 1930s are everywhere. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine recalls Hitler\u2019s European expansionism. Israel has just suffered the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, in the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. And there\u2019s been an upsurge of antisemitism in the United States. Anti-Jewish hate has infiltrated some pro-Palestinian protests initially motivated by anger over the civilian carnage of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Some of Trump\u2019s GOP allies have highlighted some antisemitic incidents on college campuses to distract from Trump\u2019s past use of antisemitic tropes, including his attacks on American Jews who vote Democrat and his implications they have dual loyalties to the US and Israel. The rising use of both Nazi innuendo and antisemitism suggest a troubling trend \u2014 the receding of the lessons of World War II and the Holocaust. The public\u2019s collective memory is fading as the Baby Boomers who grew up in the shadow of their parents\u2019 exploits in the 1940s Greatest Generation also begin to pass on. Anyone who admires Hitler and his murderous cult would do well to walk through the preserved death camps, gas chambers and mass crematoria in Eastern Europe where Nazis exterminated the continent\u2019s Jews. And those who carelessly peddle Nazi-themed rhetoric should visit the cliffs of Normandy, where Biden is expected next month to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day amid rows of buried US and Allied soldiers who perished as part of the cost of eradicating fascism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-nazi-allusions-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_house-democratic-leader-jeffries", "text": "When House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries negotiated a pair of major government funding bills with Speaker Mike Johnson earlier this year, he also quietly secured a significant victory for his own party: a considerable bump in money for transportation, housing and urban development projects back in House Democrats\u2019 home districts. Congressionally directed projects, known as earmarks, had become a major flashpoint behind the scenes between Democrats and Republicans throughout the months-long battle over spending. Democrats in the House argued they had been shortchanged in the Republican majority, getting just a fraction of the funds they believed they deserved. For months, Republicans had not budged. But in the closing days of negotiations, Jeffries delivered\u00a0a pointed\u00a0message to Johnson: Democrats were providing a huge share of the votes to avert a government shutdown and increasing their share of the earmarks was a priority, according to the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro. Ultimately, an increase in earmark spending, the\u00a0full\u00a0details of which have not been previously reported, was tucked into the transportation, housing and urban development bill for almost every single Democratic member for at least one project. It was not the full amount that Democrats had asked for, but most members saw their share in earmarks go up exactly $616,279 over what had passed months before in committee, a CNN analysis found. Asked why Democrats hadn\u2019t done a victory lap over the win in March, DeLauro said Jeffries had preferred to let it play out quietly. \u201cThere was no need. He negotiated. He got what we needed to have,\u201d DeLauro told CNN, confirming\u00a0Jeffries\u2019 role.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t always have to be a press conference when you get things done. That\u2019s his style.\u201d Jeffries\u2019 decision to insist on an earmarks boost, but not publicize the move, offers a window into his operating style during an unprecedented moment in Washington where the minority party has played a pivotal role in governing in the House. While Jeffries was eager to use Democrats\u2019 leverage to their advantage and earn valuable chips with members who will hold the keys to a potential future speakership, the top House Democrat also wanted to work with Johnson\u00a0to preserve his vote count and Jeffries\u2019 delicate but close relationship with the newly minted speaker \u2013 perhaps a tacit recognition that the roles could soon be reversed if Democrats win back the majority by a razor-thin margin this November and need to rely on Republicans to help govern next year. \u201cJeffries wants to make sure that he listens to the Democratic caucus and keeps us together, but [he is] also willing to make amends so that we can say that we are united as a Congress,\u201d veteran Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, a close Jeffries ally, told CNN. \u201cBecause we know that everybody\u2019s not a Democrat in the country.\u201d For Jeffries, the job of minority leader has come with unprecedented power over both the legislative agenda and fate of GOP leadership \u2013 largely born out of Republicans\u2019 dysfunction operating with an extremely narrow majority. Over the course of the last 16 months, the new Democratic leader has staved off dozens of poison pill riders in spending bills, helped ensure the passage of billions in aid to Ukraine and made difficult, monumental decisions about whether to save two GOP speakers\u00a0\u2013 ultimately opting to bail out Johnson but not former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. \u201cNobody at the beginning of this Congress could have imagined all this shit that has happened here, right?\u201d Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, told CNN. \u201cBut [Jeffries] has navigated a pathway for Democrats that has made us relevant and effective.\u201d In interviews with nearly two dozen Democrats, many credit Jeffries\u2019 success\u00a0thus far with his careful and delicate style. Jeffries, they say, is a listener who makes members feel heard even when he ultimately stakes out a different position, so his opposition feels respected. The\u00a0decision to save Johnson\u00a0\u2013\u00a0one of the most consequential acts Jeffries took as leader\u00a0\u2013 was more practical than personal. Democrats appreciated Johnson\u2019s willingness to put billions of dollars in foreign aid on the floor. Plus, there was a creeping concern about the harm to the institution if another ouster vote succeeded, but it was not a decision Jeffries made lightly. \u201cI saw him take the temperature of the caucus, listen a lot to people and ultimately land in a place that not everyone celebrated, but everyone was comfortable with,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, said\u00a0of the vote. Yet even though Jeffries has largely held his caucus together, there have been some notable exceptions. Not every Democrat sided with Jeffries\u2019 decision to throw Johnson a lifeline as he faced a GOP-led vote over ousting him from the speakership. And the party has grappled with deep divisions over the war between Israel and Hamas, while some vulnerable Democrats have grown antsy over the Biden administration\u2019s southern border policies ahead of November. For the most part, though, Democrats are cutting Jeffries some slack as he navigates a unique and challenging environment in Washington \u2013\u00a0all\u00a0with an eye on winning back the majority and taking the gavel for himself, which would make him the first Black speaker in history. \u201cOne could easily come in and kind of lay down the law,\u201d\u00a0said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the 32 House Democrats who voted against killing the motion to depose Johnson as speaker. \u201cBut I think the fact that there seems to be a consensus building approach is positive and encouraging to a lot of areas of the caucus.\u201d Jeffries ushers in new era of leadership Jeffries is relatively young by Washington standards. At 53-years-old, he bridges a generational divide within his caucus between the old guard who see him as a talented orator and party messenger groomed by trusted former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the next generation who are drawn to a leader who listens carefully before speaking, is accessible via text and can converse easily about politics and hip hop. Jeffries frequently talks to Speaker Emerita Pelosi, but she has been careful to give the new leader his own due, telling CNN when asked about whether she gives advice that she only offers it \u201cupon request.\u201d \u201cSee, I think everybody has to do things their own way,\u201d she said. Jeffries\u2019 amassing of power in the minority, members say,\u00a0is a combination of not only circumstance but skills honed from growing up watching the orators in his church in Brooklyn and cutting deals as a state legislator in Albany as he learned the ropes of politics. In fact, one of the things Jeffries and Johnson bonded over was their deep faith \u2013 and fittingly,\u00a0one of\u00a0the first times\u00a0the pair ever met was when Democratic Rep. Juan Vargas of California brought Jeffries to a weekly prayer breakfast where Johnson is a regular, according to a source familiar. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good working relationship,\u201d Johnson told CNN of Jeffries. \u201cI think he\u2019s a trustworthy individual, and I think he believes the same about me, and so that is very helpful when your political adversary on the other side of the table can be assured that he is shooting straight about things. I think that makes a big difference.\u201d Jeffries echoed the sentiment, laying out there is still more the Congress has to do this year, including passing a massive defense policy bill and a new farm bill. \u201cWe can agree to disagree without being disagreeable, but it\u2019s an honest, forward-looking, communicative relationship. And I look forward to continuing to work together to try to solve problems on behalf of hardworking American taxpayers,\u201d Jeffries said. If Democrats take back the House in November, it\u2019s lost on no one in his party that Jeffries would emerge as America\u2019s first Black speaker. The gavel would change everything. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between night and day. To have the gavel makes all the difference in the world,\u201d Pelosi said reflecting on the power distinction between being in the minority and the majority in the House. But winning the speakership will no doubt test the delicate balance of support and unity Jeffries has built within his ranks, which is a much easier feat in the minority. Pelosi had years of experience under her belt when the party had just a five-seat majority in the previous session of Congress.\u00a0 \u201cIt feels like he is exercising more leadership than anyone else in the Congress is right now. Democrats are fairly united. Admittedly it\u2019s easier to do that when you are in the minority,\u201d Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, said. Divisions over Israel For Jeffries, the war between Israel and Hamas has been an early test for the new leader. The issue has consumed hours of caucus meetings and discussions as members on both sides seek Jeffries for counsel and sometimes as the referee for intraparty disputes between members and at times the administration. It\u2019s an impossible position for a leader, but members on both sides of the issue say they have found their leader to be thoughtful, often quiet during passionate debate in caucus and careful in his private deliberations. After Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks on Israel, Congressman Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat from New Jersey, said Jeffries met repeatedly with a small group of Jewish members in his conference as they worked through tensions within the caucus that had erupted, sometimes in public view. The meetings were informal, but an opportunity for members to convey their views and their concerns in a candid setting. Gottheimer said that making members feel heard is one of Jeffries\u2019 gifts as a leader. \u201cHe was empathetic to the pain his members were going through,\u201d Gottheimer said of the meetings. Rep. Delia \ufeffRamirez, a Democrat from Illinois,\u00a0said that she too has found Jeffries to be open to hearing from members on what has become a difficult issue for the caucus to navigate. One of those incidents occurred in July 2023 before the attack against Israel on October 7. Speaking at a Netroots Nation conference in Chicago, Rep. Pramila Jayapal addressed protestors at the event and said that Israel was a \u201cracist\u201d state. She later walked back the comment, but Democratic leaders issued a statement, without calling out Jayapal by name, saying that \u201cIsrael is not a racist state.\u201d Ramirez and a handful of other members requested and met with Jeffries to discuss the incident and the response. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s in a difficult position because we are all his members, but I have appreciated the willingness to sit down and have really frank, difficult and painful conversations about the way that sometimes members relate to each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHas that been comfortable conversation? Probably not. But I have appreciated that he\u2019s willing to engage in the conversation even if perhaps sometimes we have been pretty upset and disappointed in feeling like not everyone\u2019s words are treated the same.\u201d The issue of Israel bubbled up again last week in the House when Republicans \u2013 seeking to reveal Democratic divisions and force a tough vote \u2013 brought to the floor a resolution to admonish the Biden administration\u2019s pausing of weapons transfers to Israel. The Democratic leadership team whipped against it and Jeffries called upon Meeks, the top Democrat on House Foreign Affairs, and Himes, the top Democrat on Intelligence, to make the case in caucus with Himes outlining the impact that the bombs could have on the battlefield in densely populated areas. \u201cHe is not at all shy on drawing on expertise,\u201d Himes said. Only 16 Democrats joined with Republicans on the bill when it came to the floor. But members say that Jeffries\u2019 leadership style \u2013 even when he is whipping against something\u2013 isn\u2019t to pressure members, but instead to explain his position. \u201cI don\u2019t see the pressure,\u201d Rep. Brad Schneider, a Democrat from Illinois, said. \u201cThere is a difference I think \u2013 and this is not specific to leader Jeffries \u2013 when you are in the minority vs. the majority, it\u2019s whether something passes or fails.\u201d Jeffries the campaigner As he seeks to win back the majority, Jeffries has also been building out the campaign and fundraising apparatus that can afford a leader goodwill within their party and help secure a majority. As of the end of March, numbers obtained by CNN show that Jeffries had raised more than $140 million for House Democrats, contributing more than $7 million to frontline members and candidates seeking to flip Republican seats to Democratic seats in the upcoming election. \u201cHe\u2019s fabulous. He\u2019s a big draw. People are so hopeful after they hear him,\u201d Pelosi said, a major fundraiser in her own right.\u00a0 \u201cWe left him a strong foundation, a great force that I had to build. I did not inherit that of mobilization, organization at the grassroots level, money in terms of making it all happen and again, path to victory.\u201d Members say they got an up close look at Jeffries as a campaigner earlier this year in New York\u2019s third Congressional District where Democrats were able to win back a seat that had previously been held by Republican Rep. George Santos. \u201cHe is very engaged and not always in a way that is in the headlines. He is very focused on the ground game,\u201d Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, told CNN in an interview. Jeffries showed up to campaign for Tom Suozzi as well as was involved in ensuring the campaign and members helping Suozzi had everything they needed. A snowstorm on election day meant Meng was coordinating with Jeffries\u00a0making sure there was an adequate plan to get out the vote and find rides for voters. \u201cObviously Hakeem as a leader is a skilled messenger. But he is also a practical and tactical manager,\u201d she said. New York\u2019s third congressional district is just the beginning of the path to the majority for Democrats. This year, the path to the speakership could cross right through Jeffries\u2019 own backyard. Several key targets for Democrats this cycle are in New York. Jeffries announced along with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0that this year the state\u2019s Democrats would run a coordinated campaign to ensure that the party\u2019s nominees are working together on their field game and messaging, a sign that they want to turn back the tide on the red wave that happened in New York in 2022. Jeffries has also worked to ensure that Democratic members are helping one another get elected, encouraging members to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThere are people who had a different relationship with the DCCC who are now rallying behind it, and I think that has a lot to do with his leadership and the way he kind of brings members along,\u201d said Rep. Lori Trahan, a Democrat from Massachusetts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/house-democratic-leader-jeffries/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_28_politics_state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg", "text": "This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion \u2013 and a few aimed at restricting it. Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years. Abortion measures on the ballot in November Several states \u2014\u00a0Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state\u2019s 15-week ban on May 1. New York previously secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment measure on its November ballot, which would amend the state\u2019s constitution to say that a person\u2019s rights cannot be denied due to \u201cpregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d\u00a0The measure, which also seeks to protect against discrimination based on race, disability, gender identity and more, was recently struck from the ballot by a state judge \u2014 a decision that state Attorney General Letitia James has appealed. States with potential abortion ballot measures Organizers in other states across the country are working to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline this summer, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which are fundraising to secure the money to support the campaigns. Arizona, Nevada and Montana have all seen proposed measures protecting abortion access up to the point of viability, which doctors say is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. A potential measure in Arkansas would allow abortion up to 20 weeks into pregnancy or in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. A potential measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0could still make the ballot in November.\u00a0An opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion,\u00a0however,\u00a0never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session. A number of potential measures, like those in Nevada and Montana, allow for abortion past the point of viability when deemed necessary by a doctor to protect a pregnant person\u2019s life or health \u2014 though doctors and lawmakers have struggled to define exactly what type of medical emergencies would be allowed under the exception. A proposed measure to restrict abortion access in Pennsylvania seeks to establish that public funding can\u2019t be used for the procedure, though it is unlikely to pass the state legislature. States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed. While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Lewandowski\u2019s return to Trump world comes after Make America Great Again Action severed ties with Lewandowski in 2021 following reports that a donor accused him of making unwanted sexual advances toward her.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_trump-documents-case-judge-cannon-hearing", "text": "During a marathon day of proceedings in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, a morning hearing in front of Judge Aileen Cannon devolved into a shouting match amongst the attorneys, and the afternoon series of arguments prompted the judge to wonder if the legal nuances of the case may be too difficult for jurors to understand. The heated arguments played out in a morning proceeding in Fort Pierce, Florida, that had been scheduled for Walt Nauta, one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s co-defendants, to present arguments that special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team had selectively and vindictively brought charges against him. But the hearing quickly diverted into a longstanding disagreement over an August 2022 meeting between prosecutor Jay Bratt and Nauta\u2019s defense attorney, Stanley Woodward. Woodward has claimed in court proceedings and filings that Bratt attempted to pressure him into convincing Nauta to cooperate against Trump by threatening to affect a potential judgeship nomination. Cannon did not issue a ruling from the bench on Nauta\u2019s motion that the case be dismissed on those grounds. Nor did Cannon rule on a motion she heard during an afternoon session Wednesday, brought by all three of the case\u2019s defendants, who claimed that the indictment suffers technical flaws that required the dismissal of the charges. Cannon seemed skeptical of those arguments, while also expressing concern about a jury\u2019s ability to understand legal nuances in the case at a future trial. \u201cReal people have to decide these issues,\u201d Cannon said. Prosecutor says defense attorney was making \u2018garbage argument\u2019 Nauta claims that he was criminally charged in the case as retaliation for declining to cooperate with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the former president\u2019s retention of classified documents at his estate. \u201cI had been recommended for a judgeship, that\u2019s beyond dispute,\u201d Woodward said Wednesday. \u201cThere was a folder about defense counsel on the table\u201d during that meeting, he said, claiming Bratt referenced that judgeship recommendation. \u201cI think the implication was that I was to travel and convince Mr. Nauta to cooperate with the investigation, and if I didn\u2019t that, there would be consequences,\u201d Woodward said. Prosecutor David Harbach then rose and accused Woodward of engaging in \u201cprocedural gamesmanship\u201d by making a \u201cgarbage argument\u201d about the meeting. \u201cMr. Woodward\u2019s story of what happened at that meeting is a fantasy,\u201d Harbach shouted, banging his hand on the lectern in front of him. \u201cIt did not happen.\u201d The heated proceedings Wednesday come as the Manhattan\u00a0hush money case\u00a0against Trump nears its conclusion and a new phase of pretrial activity gets underway in the\u00a0federal classified documents prosecution in Florida. The hearing was the first before Cannon since she indefinitely delayed the start of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin as early as this week. It has been more than a month since the judge last held a public, in-person hearing in the case \u2013 though she has held at least one sealed proceeding since then. Trump is charged with taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and of resisting the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. Trump, Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira have all pleaded\u00a0not guilty. During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Harbach slammed Woodward, saying he chose not to report the alleged incident until months later and has repeatedly changed his recollection of the conversation. \u201cThis is a lawyer whose allegations amount basically to him being extorted,\u201d Harbach said of Woodward, waving his arms. Woodward sat behind the prosecutor with his hands clasped and his head down. The judge quickly scolded Harbach, telling the attorney to \u201ccalm down.\u201d Cannon questioned why there was no evidence gathered of what happened in the 2022 conversation, saying, \u201cWhy do those comments [about Woodward] have to be made?\u201d \u201cThat is not true, and I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Harbach shouted back. The prosecutor said that that there was no recording of the conversation between Bratt and Woodward, but that Smith\u2019s team has preserved any record they have of the meeting. Woodward shot back up to the lectern, saying that \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and offering to testify under oath to what he remembered of the meeting. Nauta\u2019s request to dismiss the case was the first of two issues before Cannon on Wednesday. An afternoon hearing will center on co-defendants\u2019\u00a0argument the indictment suffers technical flaws requiring its dismissal. Trump had obtained permission from the judge\u00a0to skip Wednesday\u2019s proceedings. Cannon says that jury may struggle to understand charges When postponing the trial,\u00a0Cannon pointed to the mountain of unresolved pretrial issues for not putting a new date on the calendar. Wednesday kicks off a stretch of hearings scheduled through late July that will get the case through some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the pretrial issues. During the afternoon portion of Wednesday\u2019s arguments, the defense lawyers raised concerns about how prosecutors structured the indictment, claiming that the wording for different charges within the same indictment sometimes sounded the same. Prosecutor Jay Bratt said the charges reference different parts of the obstruction statute used to charge Trump and two of his employees. Bratt also pointed out that jurors would be given clear instructions about the charges during a trial. Cannon said that while \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard for someone to detect what\u2019s different in these counts,\u201d\u00a0she noted \u201cthat will be a project\u201d down the road. Cannon has not yet set a trial date in the case after indefinitely postponing it in an order earlier this month. The Florida judge spent hours Wednesday entertaining theories from defense attorneys about what they say were problems in the investigation and prosecution of the former president, Nauta and the third co-defendant, Carlos De Oliveira. The defense theories\u00a0ranged from allegations that prosecutors tried to extort Nauta\u2019s attorney to claims prosecutors used inappropriate and\u00a0\u201cattention-grabbing\u201d descriptions of Mar-a-Lago in the indictment. Cannon ultimately suggested that the \u201cpotpourri of criticisms\u201d from the three defense teams may be best suited for a jury to decide at an eventual trial. Several legal issues have still gone unresolved, including at least five motions to dismiss the criminal case. Cannon has repeatedly suggested that\u00a0various legal issues could be punted down the road and handled closer to trial. Cannon\u2019s slow pace in the case\u00a0has attracted criticisms from outside legal experts, who have accused the Trump-appointed\u00a0judge of playing into delay tactics by the GOP\u2019s presumptive\u00a0White House nominee. Unless Cannon picks up her momentum considerably, it appears unlikely the charges will go before a jury before the 2024 election. If Trump wins the White House, it is expected he will make the charges against him go\u00a0away. Newly unsealed filings give more details about the investigation Until recent days, several major motions from Trump attacking the prosecution were not even publicly docketed. The proceedings have become mired in disputes over what should be redacted in public filings. On Tuesday, hundreds of pages of previously sealed court filings were posted publicly as part of efforts by the former president to have the charges against him thrown out. Those filings included a previously sealed March 2023 ruling by a federal judge in Washington, DC, finding there was \u201csufficient\u201d evidence that Trump committed crimes, allowing investigators to obtain information from his former lawyer that would normally be protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump is seeking to throw out that evidence, as well as the evidence obtained in the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, from which investigators obtained many of the documents underlying several of the charges against Trump. Those motions are not scheduled for argument on Wednesday, and Cannon has not yet set a hearing on them. In her order Sunday allowing for the filings to be made public, Cannon took a shot at prosecutors \u2013 one of several swipes she\u2019s made at Smith\u2019s office. She expressed \u201cconcern\u201d the special counsel\u2019s office had sought redactions of information in the newly unsealed filings after previously giving its OK for that information to be published in full in earlier court filings. \u201cThe Court is disappointed in these developments. The sealing and redaction rules should be applied consistently and fairly upon a sufficient factual and legal showing,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cAnd parties should not make requests that undermine any prior representations or positions except upon full disclosure to the Court and appropriate briefing.\u201d This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/trump-documents-case-judge-cannon-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_louisiana-house-bill-abortion-drugs-controlled-substances", "text": "The Louisiana state House on Tuesday passed an amended\u00a0bill that would classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifepristone as Schedule IV\u00a0controlled dangerous substances\u00a0in the state, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants. The House\u2019s final passage vote was 64-29, and the bill now heads back to the Senate for concurrence. Senate Bill 276\u00a0would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added after it passed out of the Senate. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is\u00a0already banned\u00a0in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. In a\u00a0medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug,\u00a0misoprostol,\u00a0is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades. The amended bill would make it a felony \u2013 punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 \u2013 for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription. The legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs. In Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs\u00a0carries a penalty\u00a0of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000. \u201cAbsolutely unconscionable,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X in response to the bill\u2019s House passage Tuesday night, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump did this.\u201d The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cAdding abortion drugs to the\u00a0controlled substance\u00a0list should be uncontroversial. Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like miscarriage care\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\u201d Caitlin Connors, the group\u2019s southern regional director, said in a news release. CNN has previously reported that the bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification. The letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \u201cneither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\u201d The letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \u201cthe false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\u201d and that they are \u201cwidely prescribed and taken safely.\u201d Pressly rebutted the letter\u2019s claims in a response he shared with CNN last week: \u201cIf enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\u201d \u201cThe doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\u201d he continued. If the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed out of the House, it will next head to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry.\u00a0If Landry were to sign the bill into law, Louisiana would become the only state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.

{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump finally had a good day in court. The presumptive GOP nominee has often seemed embarrassed and infuriated by his first criminal trial, which has featured salacious expos\u00e9s of his personal life and details of his alleged attempts to cover it up. But on Thursday, he got to savor his former fixer-turned-enemy Michael Cohen wobbling on the stand under a fearsome cross-examination. Cohen appeared to be tripped up over an account of a call he\u2019d previously said under oath was to discuss Trump\u2019s hush money payment to adult film Star Stormy Daniels. It emerged under questioning on Thursday that, at least to begin with, the topic of the call was about another matter entirely. It was the kind of inconsistency that Trump\u2019s attorneys can use to try to sow reasonable doubt about Cohen\u2019s truthfulness and credibility in the mind of a single juror. That\u2019s all it would take for Trump to walk. And now, the prosecution faces a stiff challenge in repairing the damage when they get to their redirect examination of Cohen\u2019s testimony following the close of cross-examination next week. \u201cI think what happened today still is so devastating they have to do something,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cIf the case ended today and there were final statements, I think there would not be a conviction.\u201d Trump left court after a day in which he was supported by another posse of GOP lawmakers, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, well satisfied. \u201cI think it was a very interesting day, it was a fascinating day. And it shows what a scam this whole thing is,\u201d the former president said. His hyperbolic spin and unique take on proceedings rang less hollow than usual given several positive moments for the defense in what has largely been a grim month for Trump in the courtroom. Another day of testimony from Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s critical witness, came as the case hurtled toward its climax with the judge telling lawyers to be ready to deliver summations as early as Tuesday. That means it\u2019s feasible the jury will retire to consider its verdict in the first criminal trial of a former president sometime after Memorial Day and just five months before Trump hopes to reclaim the White House. A pivotal moment On Tuesday, when the court was last in session this week, Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche had what most legal experts viewed as a rough day as he embarked on the cross-examination of Cohen. But he bounced back in a big way Thursday. Blanche first spent time seeking to destroy Cohen\u2019s credibility. He highlighted the former Trump fixer\u2019s proven history of lying for his former boss and on his own behalf. And using text messages and social media posts, he established that Cohen resented Trump and wanted to see him convicted in a case in which the ex-president is accused of falsifying financial records to hide the payoff in 2016 in an early example of election interference. (He has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Daniels.) Then, in one of the most dramatic moments in the entire trial, Blanche drilled down on a call that Cohen placed to his boss\u2019 bodyguard, Keith Schiller, who was with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen had testified earlier this week that the purpose of the call was to discuss with Trump \u201cthe Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.\u201d But Blanche produced a text from Cohen to Schiller before the call in which the lawyer said he wanted to get help in dealing with a 14-year-old who was prank calling him. He didn\u2019t mention Daniels in the text ahead of the conversation, which only lasted 96 seconds. \u201cThat was a lie!\u201d Blanche said, raising his voice. \u201cYou did not talk to President Trump on that night, you talked to Keith Schiller. \u2026 You can admit it.\u201d Blanche argued that it was impossible that Cohen would have had sufficient time to discuss the prank calls and then go on to update Trump about the complicated situation with Daniels. Cohen insisted, \u201cI believe I also spoke to President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it\u2019s going to be resolved.\u201d Blanche then wielded a rhetorical dagger, telling Cohen: \u201cWe are not asking for your belief \u2013 this jury doesn\u2019t want to hear what you think happened.\u201d Judge Juan Merchan sustained an immediate objection from the prosecution to the comment, but Trump\u2019s lawyer had emphatically made his point. The exchange was so significant because \u2013 notwithstanding days of testimony and evidence put on by the prosecution to corroborate claims that Trump broke the law \u2013 the case still largely depends on Cohen, himself a convicted felon who has a proven record of lying. Since the burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt lies with the prosecution, the exchange could raise the chances of at least one juror questioning Cohen\u2019s version of events. And it also raises the possibility that some jurors might believe that they have been lied to by Cohen earlier in the trial. If such a feeling takes hold among jurors, who have put their lives on hold to hear the case, it could be disastrous to the prosecution. \u2018A blow on the chin\u2019 No one can say how individual members of the jury will sift the evidence and competing testimony. But experienced trial lawyers immediately spotted a potential turning point. \u201cI think it has to have raised some doubt,\u201d criminal defense attorney Nikki Lotze said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d of Blanche\u2019s clash with Cohen. \u201cThere was testimony previously that this phone call was about X and now there are texts that suggest it is about Y \u2026 and not a lot of time for there to be a conversation about both X and Y.\u201c Jim Trusty, a former Trump attorney, also believed the exchange was significant and was cause for the ex-president to feel upbeat. \u201cThe defense set the whole trial up to be a referendum on Cohen\u2019s honesty. That is exactly where you want this fight to be, so it is a good moment,\u201d he said. When Blanche eventually wraps up his cross-examination of Cohen, the prosecution will get a chance to try to repair any damage from one of the trial\u2019s most significant moments so far. Some experts pointed out that it was only one small blip compared to a mountain of evidence, much of which looks potentially problematic for Trump. Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst, said that Blanche\u2019s apparent trip-up of Cohen was good professional lawyering by the defense, but he disputed the idea that the episode was devastating to the prosecution case. \u201cIt was a blow on the chin. My experience of 30 years of doing this is it takes more than one punch to knock out a witness,\u201d Eisen told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Conservative lawyer and sworn Trump critic George Conway, who was also in court Thursday, told CNN that while there were some good moments for Blanche, much of his cross-examination was \u201cscattered\u201d and meandering and did not establish a strong narrative. But another less theatrical moment in Thursday\u2019s testimony may also offer the defense a strong opening in their final summation to the jury. Blanche asked Cohen about a time when he said he lied under oath to a judge in a different case because \u201cthe stakes affected you personally.\u201d Cohen agreed he had. Then Blanche asked Cohen: \u201cDoes the outcome of this trial affect you personally?\u201d Cohen answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The unspoken implication here is that if Cohen lied in a previous trial that affected him personally, why would he not do the same in a trial involving his now sworn foe, the former president? Again, the defense doesn\u2019t have to prove Cohen is lying. It just has to make one juror think it\u2019s possible \u2014 and therefore make impossible the unanimous verdict needed for conviction. Many prosecutions use potentially problematic witnesses with histories of lying and demonstrated antipathy toward the accused all the time \u2014 for instance, in organized crime cases where lower-ranking associates are used to incriminate kingpins despite their own legal vulnerabilities. So Cohen\u2019s struggles at a key moment on Thursday don\u2019t necessarily mean this case is in deep trouble. But everyone connected with the trial knew before it began that Cohen\u2019s pivotal role in this case represented a risk for the prosecution. The huge scale of that gamble was laid bare in court on Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trumps-history-could-hurt-him-with-the-jury", "text": "Time and again, former President Donald Trump teased the possibility of taking the witness stand to tell his version of the hush money tale.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m testifying,\u201d he said in early April\u00a0before the historic trial took off.\u00a0\u201cI mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there\u2019s no case, they have no case.\u201d Now the defense has wrapped, the jury will soon be instructed, and Trump has never strayed from the safety of the defense table. Many legal analysts insist that was the smart play. Opening himself to prosecutorial questioning would have been a huge risk, especially since he has a long history of behavior that mirrors the accusations he faces. Consider the three questions that form the backbone of\u00a0the case: Did Trump have an affair? Did he falsify business records to\u00a0hide a hush money payment?\u00a0And did he do it to protect his\u00a02016\u00a0bid for the White House \u2013 violating campaign laws? Trump has denied the affair, but he\u2019s also fostered a lifelong image of himself as a man with a wandering eye. Each of his three marriages has been plagued by reports of infidelity. He bragged on that infamous\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape\u00a0about how he approaches women he finds attractive. \u201cI just start kissing them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\u2019t even wait. And when you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d Prosecutors showed jurors a transcript of that tape in court. At the heart of the E. Jean Carroll case is the assertion that Trump sexually assaulted her in a department store. Trump called it a lie. A court said by making that claim, he defamed her and would have to pay more than $80\u00a0million.\u00a0And as prosecutors reminded jurors,\u00a0former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal\u00a0has alleged a\u00a0monthslong\u00a0affair with Trump starting in 2006 also eventually capped off with a hush money payment. Trump denies\u00a0wrongdoing there\u00a0too. None of this proves he had sex with an adult film star he met at a golf course, but it could be understandable if a juror found the accusation on brand. The idea of Trump falsifying records to help his cause is also familiar. Just this past February, New York state Judge Arthur Engoron ruled Trump must pay $355 million for submitting fraudulent paperwork about the value of his properties to get favorable tax and loan terms. Trump is appealing. Lastly, would Trump break the law to win an election? He is charged right now with just that - accused of trying to pressure election officials into tossing out legitimate votes, orchestrating slates of fake electors to claim he won, pushing Vice President Mike Pence to refuse certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory, and urging his followers to \u201cfight like hell\u201d just before they stormed the Capitol leading to damage, injury and deaths. Trump has publicly and repeatedly defended each one of those steps\u00a0in the wake of the 2020 election. Trump has every right to dispute the charges against him, and juries are routinely urged to focus only on the evidence. Judge\u00a0Juan\u00a0Merchan has instructed this jury specifically to avoid exposure to any outside information about the case. Legal analysts often marvel at how well jurors do that. And because Trump did not testify, these jurors may be able to push aside their knowledge of his long history. Then again, many of the things Trump has done \u2013 and often bragged about \u2013 have been in the headlines for decades shaping how Americans see him. What\u2019s more, even though some of these matters were only tangentially raised before the jury,\u00a0legal wrangling over the Carroll case, the real estate fraud ruling and now the hush money matter has taken place in the very town that produced the jury pool and Trump himself: New York City. That heightens the possibility of jurors being aware of Trump\u2019s legal problems and public image writ large. All of that means, even without Trump taking the stand, his\u00a0public persona may not be so easily forgotten when the door to the jury room closes and deliberations begin.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trumps-history-could-hurt-him-with-the-jury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_donald-trump-fundraising-email-what-matters", "text": "Followers of former President Donald Trump were meant to be startled when they were sent an email Tuesday, addressed from \u201cPresident Trump,\u201d with this arresting subject line: \u201cThey were authorized to shoot me!\u201d The preview line in the email did not back down. \u201cI nearly escaped death. Biden\u2019s DOJ was locked and loaded for deadly force at Mar-a-Lago \u2026\u201d Literal readers of Trump\u2019s message might wonder: Is this a cry for help from physical harm? But everyone should know it is just Trump asking, again, for money. Writing fundraising emails for politicians these days frequently seems like an exercise in clickbait, but alleging a life in danger is something new. It also feels like a twist on the outrageous \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d argument Trump\u2019s lawyer made before the US Supreme Court last month that presidents should, at least in theory, be able to call out a hit on a political rival and not face prosecution. What is Trump talking about? The actual facts of the \u201cauthorized to shoot me\u201d allegation, as reported by CNN, are these: A recently unsealed document outlining the FBI\u2019s procedure for searching Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022 for classified documents included standard language about the \u201cuse of force\u201d in searches. From CNN\u2019s report by Tierney Sneed,\u00a0Katelyn Polantz,\u00a0Holmes Lybrand\u00a0and\u00a0Hannah Rabinowitz: The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. What actually happened? The FBI coordinated the search with the Secret Service and took pains to be as low profile as possible, according to testimony on Capitol Hill last year by Stephen D\u2019Antuono, former FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington field office. \u201cWe made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues,\u201d D\u2019Antuono said. \u201cWe\u2019re not banging down any doors. We weren\u2019t bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.\u201d Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago when the search occurred, and he actually announced the search was occurring with a post to social media. Read CNN\u2019s original report on the search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. Those details don\u2019t fit into the subject line of an email, and they certainly don\u2019t fit Trump\u2019s narrative that he is being persecuted. The more important headline from the unsealed documents, according to CNN\u2019s report from Tuesday, was that a federal judge in Washington, DC, found \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of crimes before Trump was charged with mishandling classified data. The judge, Beryl Howell, cited the discovery of additional documents with classified markings found in Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago bedroom months after the FBI search. Trump is a master sensationalist, so place the email subject line where he says he\u2019s in physical harm within his oeuvre of over-the-top and untrue allegations. How to get people to open fundraising emails The email address where I get fundraising pitches from politicians received seven such messages from Trump on Tuesday. On any given day, there will likely be at least one that is misleading. Like this one from Tuesday: \u201cI\u2019ve made a final decision. What do you think of my VP choice?\u201d (In truth, Trump has not announced who his running mate will be). Other subject lines are pushing merch: \u201cYOU, have you seen my mugshot? I put it on a mug for you.\u201d (In related news, Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is now selling his own brand of coffee.) There are sweepstakes to win trips to Las Vegas and London. (You can enter to win with a $20.24 contribution). Trump\u2019s allegations about the FBI document were not just contained in the fundraising email. In a post to social media, he weaved the \u201cdeadly force\u201d allegation in with other, ongoing complaints: The temperature in his Manhattan criminal trial courtroom was too cold. Trump thinks President Joe Biden is unfit for office, and he thinks Biden\u2019s Cabinet should remove him from the presidency. The social media post looked like this: \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d The truth is that voters will get to weigh in on Biden\u2019s fitness for office. The New York criminal trial judge, Juan Merchan, explained to Trump at trial that raising the thermostat would turn the ice box into an oven. And there\u2019s absolutely no indication whatsoever that anyone in Biden\u2019s Cabinet is now considering or ever has considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. On that last point, the same cannot be said for Trump \u2013 some of whose Cabinet members did discuss but did not act on using the 25th Amendment after the riot at the Capitol in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/donald-trump-fundraising-email-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Rick Scott\u00a0announced\u00a0his bid to be the next Senate GOP leader on Wednesday, putting him in a three-way secret ballot race that will be decided after the November elections. Scott has been a longtime supporter of former President Donald Trump and has maintained an icy relationship with GOP leadership in the Senate, including with outgoing Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, whose leadership position he is again gunning for after losing a long-shot bid to replace the Kentucky Republican in 2022. Scott, a first-term senator, would be considered an underdog in the race, which includes GOP Sens. John Thune, the minority whip, and John Cornyn, a former whip. The two other men have for months jockeyed to tip the scales in a race with no clear front-runner as their colleagues in the Senate weigh the candidates\u2019 fundraising abilities, leadership styles and their relationships with Trump \u2014 though the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has yet to endorse a replacement for McConnell, who has said he will step down as GOP leader in November. On Wednesday night, Scott told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that he had spoken to Trump earlier in the day about the need for change in the chamber, adding that the former president was \u201cexcited I\u2019m\u00a0getting into the race.\u201d \u201cI am a change agent.\u00a0I was a change agent in\u00a0business.\u00a0I did turn arounds.\u00a0I changed Florida,\u201d Scott said.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the\u00a0Senate.\u00a0We\u2019re going to be the Senate\u00a0that helps Donald Trump get his\u00a0conservative agenda done.\u201d Scott has long been a close Trump ally and quickly endorsed the former president over his home-state governor, Ron DeSantis, for president last year. He was one of several Republican senators who objected to the certification of 2020 election results and has been a constant defender of Trump in the face of his legal troubles. A former CEO of an embattled health care company, Scott has used his wealth to help fund his campaigns, serving two terms as the governor of Florida before his election to the Senate in 2018. He\u2019s facing reelection this year in a red-trending state that Democrats hope to put in play. Scott, then the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, became a pariah to some in his own party in 2022, when he released a proposal that would have sunset all federal programs in five years unless Congress extended them. Even McConnell quickly disavowed the plan, while Democrats pounced on it as a way to accuse Republicans of attempting to undercut popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. Months later, Scott walked back major sections of that plan to shield many of those popular programs \u2014 like Social Security and Medicare \u2014 from being sunset. Though, Democrats looking to turn his Senate seat blue in 2024 have continued to hit Scott on that unpopular proposal. This story has been updated with additional details.

With her victory over the more progressive Jamie McLeod Skinner, Bynum will take on Republican freshman Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who was unopposed in her primary Tuesday. Many Oregon Democratic leaders and national groups rallied around Bynum\u2019s House bid, seeing her as the stronger candidate to take on Chavez-DeRemer.\u00a0The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee poured more than $1 million into the race\u00a0on Bynum\u2019s behalf\u00a0and named her to\u00a0its\u00a0\u201cRed to Blue\u201d list\u00a0for strong recruits. The 5th\u00a0District, which stretches south from the Portland suburbs to Bend, is a top Democratic target as one of 16 GOP-held seats that Joe Biden would have carried in 2020 under the current lines. Bynum, who runs four McDonalds franchises in the Portland area, is currently serving her fourth term in the Oregon House. She won her first two terms with victories over none other than Chavez-DeRemer. McLeod-Skinner, an attorney, was the 2022 Democratic nominee for the seat \u2013 she upset moderate Rep. Kurt Schrader in the primary before narrowly losing to Chavez-DeRemer in the general election.\u00a0In this year\u2019s race, she\u00a0had the backing of progressive groups, including the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. In the final weeks of the campaign, she was also supported on air by a group called Health Equity Now,\u00a0which\u00a0touted her support for\u00a0\u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\u00a0The group has ties to Republican operatives. The\u00a0Democratic primary for the 5th\u00a0District\u00a0grew contentious at times. Some former McLeod-Skinner aides accused her of creating a hostile work environment,\u00a0according to a report in the Oregon Capitol Chronicle. McLeod-Skinner said she tried to create a \u201cpositive\u201d workplace and apologized to anyone who didn\u2019t have a good experience. McLeod-Skinner criticized Bynum for casting the sole vote against legislation that would have extended the statute of limitations for rape civil cases from two years to seven. Bynum later voted for the bill after it was amended to five years. Oregon\u2019s 3rd District Meanwhile, in Oregon\u2019s 3rd District, state Rep. Maxine Dexter will win the Democratic primary, CNN projects, putting her on a glide path to Congress from the solidly blue Portland-area seat. Longtime Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer is retiring after almost three decades in Congress. Dexter, a pulmonologist who has served in the state House since 2020, touted legislation she sponsored to make the opioid overdose treatment naloxone more accessible. Her closest rival for the nomination was Susheela Jayapal, a former Multnomah County commissioner, who portrayed herself as the most progressive candidate in the seven-way primary. Jayapal had the backing of prominent progressives, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and her sister Pramila Jayapal, who represents neighboring Washington state and chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Dexter raised $919,000 through May 1, while Jayapal raised $770,000. \u00a0A third Democrat, Gresham City Councilor Eddy Morales, raised $606,000. Dexter has benefitted from more than $1.6 million in outside spending from 314 Action Fund, a super PAC that helps to elect Democrats with science backgrounds. The group delayed its spending blitz in the district until April, meaning it did not need to reveal its donors until the day before the election, after many voters had received their ballots. Jayapal and Morales\u00a0held a joint news conference\u00a0denouncing the dark money pouring into the race on Dexter\u2019s behalf. Dexter also denounced the spending, which she called a \u201cprime example of how broken our campaign finance system is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/janelle-bynum-oregon-democratic-primary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban", "text": "All of South Dakota\u2019s nine indigenous tribes have voted to ban Gov. Kristi Noem from\u00a0their\u00a0lands. On Tuesday, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe executive council ruled in favor\u00a0of barring\u00a0the Republican governor\u00a0from its reservation. In response to a request for comment on Wednesday, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe sent a readout of its president\u2019s interactions with Noem ahead of the vote. Flandreau President Tony Reider called an emergency meeting last weekend in response to Noem\u2019s comments, according to the readout. The meeting was \u201ccontentious at times, as some members vocalized their opposition.\u201d After that Reider set up a meeting with the governor\u2019s office, which took place on Monday. That conversation was \u201crespectful and productive.\u201d \u201cPresident Reider informed the governor that a ban from our territories is imminent and requested that the Governor refrain from making future blanket statements that offend the tribes within the boundaries of the State of South Dakota, some of which depend on state services for the needs of their people. It was recommended that the Governor clarify her statements and issue an apology to all tribal nations for the misunderstanding,\u201d the readout said. \u201cUntil such a time, the Executive Council and the people of the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe stand with our fellow nations.\u201d That vote bookended a ripple effect of tribes with reservations that stretch into South Dakota moving to prevent Noem from setting foot on their land,\u00a0spurred by comments\u00a0she\u00a0made earlier this year. During a town hall, she\u00a0argued\u00a0that tribal leaders were profiting off of drug cartels in the state and prioritizing those cartels over parenting children on their reservations. Noem has since doubled down on saying Mexican drug cartels were rampant on Native American reservations in South Dakota. Those comments sparked a domino\u00a0effect\u00a0of tribes denouncing Noem and voting to bar the governor from their lands. According to\u00a0The Argus Leader of South Dakota, leaders of the Flandreau Santee Sioux had been receiving pressure from local citizens to do something in response to Noem\u2019s comments. In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, the governor did not directly address the ban, but said she hoped to work with tribal leaders going forward. \u201cI only want to speak truth to the real challenges that are being faced in some areas of Indian Country. I want to focus on solutions that lead to safer communities for all our families, educational outcomes for all our children, and declining addiction numbers for all our people. We cannot tackle these issues without addressing the problem: dangerous criminals who perpetuate violence and illegal activities in all areas of our state,\u201d Noem said in the statement. \u201cWe need to take action. It is my hope tribal leadership will take the opportunity to work with me to be an example of how cooperation is better for all people rather than political attacks.\u201d Earlier in May, the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe voted to bar Noem from reservation land. The Standing Rock Sioux, Crow Creek Sioux, Rosebud, Cheyenne River Sioux,\u00a0Oglala Sioux and Lower Brule Sioux tribes all had similar votes earlier this year. The votes came as Noem found herself in the national spotlight over anecdotes from her recently released book describing killing her 14-month-old wirehair pointer, named Cricket, and an unnamed goat. The book included anecdotes about Noem meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and cancelling a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. Noem and\u00a0staff\u00a0\u00a0have since indicated that the Kim anecdote\u00a0did not happen and should not have been in the book. French officials have denied any such meeting between Macron and the South Dakota governor, while she was a member of Congress, ever took place. Before her book rollout, Noem\u2019s name had been mentioned on the shortlist to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential\u00a0pick\u00a0in 2024. But\u00a0her\u00a0standing\u00a0has faded. Noem has not softened her rhetoric about tribes and Mexican cartels. Instead, she\u2019s repeatedly stressed the importance of border security and warned that the Southern border between Texas and Mexico was experiencing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants. Noem has scheduled press conference about border security and how it affects South Dakota. \u201cBanishing me does nothing to solve this problem or to help those who are suffering horrific tragedies,\u201d Noem said in a statement from her office last week.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYesterday, I returned home from the dangerous, deadly warzone at our nation\u2019s Southern Border. South Dakota National Guard soldiers have helped the Texas National Guard construct miles of border wall in 100-degree weather to keep the American people safe \u2013 and keep cartel-driven drugs and human trafficking out of our great country.\u201d Over the last few months, Noem and other top South Dakota officials have announced new programs for tribal law enforcement. In April, Noem and\u00a0state\u00a0Attorney General Marty Jackley rolled out a certification program to help speed up training for local law enforcement.\u00a0And\u00a0earlier this month, Noem named Algin Young, previously the chief of police for the Pine Ridge Reservation, as South Dakota\u2019s Tribal Law Enforcement Liaison.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_south-carolina-gender-affirming-care-ban-minors", "text": "South Carolina\u2019s Republican governor on Tuesday signed\u00a0a law banning gender-affirming\u00a0medical\u00a0care for minors in the state. Gov. Henry McMaster announced the signing of\u00a0H 4624\u00a0in a statement\u00a0on social media, saying the measure \u201cprotects our state\u2019s children from irreversible gender transition procedures and bans public funds from being used for them.\u201d With the law, South Carolina joins more than 20 other states in restricting gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The measure passed earlier this month by 28-8 in the state Senate and 67-26 in the\u00a0state\u00a0House. The legislation, which takes effect immediately,\u00a0bars physicians from providing gender-affirming\u00a0medical care to minors,\u00a0including\u00a0hormone treatments, puberty blockers\u00a0and surgeries\u00a0\u2013 though surgical procedures are rarely performed on children. Major medical associations agree that such care\u00a0is appropriate for gender dysphoria, the psychological distress that may result when a person\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align. Under the new law\u2019s provisions,\u00a0physicians can\u00a0temporarily\u00a0continue providing hormone treatments and puberty blockers to minors who were prescribed those treatments prior to August 1,\u00a02024,\u00a0if the health care professional determines and documents that\u00a0immediately\u00a0discontinuing the treatment would case the minor harm.\u00a0The provider \u201cmay\u00a0institute a period during which the person\u2019s use of the drug or hormone is systematically reduced,\u201d which must end by January 31, 2025. South Carolina health care professionals\u00a0who provide\u00a0such care\u00a0to minors\u00a0outside those limits\u00a0would be \u201csubject to discipline\u201d by their licensing entity and open to civil lawsuits.\u00a0A physician performing surgery could face state charges of inflicting great bodily injury upon a child and could be imprisoned up to 20 years if convicted. The law also requires school officials to notify the\u00a0parents or\u00a0guardians of a minor if their child has told school\u00a0employees their gender doesn\u2019t align with their\u00a0sex\u00a0assigned at birth or if they ask to use different pronouns. \u201cWe can put to rest the notion that the governor cares about limited government and personal freedom,\u201d Jace Woodrum, executive director of the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union\u00a0of South Carolina,\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, he has chosen to insert the will of politicians into healthcare decisions, trample on the liberties of trans South Carolinians, and deny the rights of the parents of trans minors,\u201d Woodrum added. The Human Rights Campaign issued a statement calling the law \u201ca major violation of South Carolinians\u2019 freedoms.\u201d The measure \u201cthreatens to plunge the transgender community into a deeper health care crisis, leaving Virginia as the only Southern state without a ban, worsening nightmarish travel times and stripping transgender youth throughout the South of access to care,\u201d Brandon Wolf, the group\u2019s national press secretary, said in the statement. South Carolina becomes just the latest state to restrict the care for trans minors, with around half\u00a0of all states placing similar laws on their books in recent years. As the laws spread across the country, so too do legal challenges to the health care restrictions. The challenges have resulted\u00a0in conflicting rulings from federal judges and circuit courts,\u00a0placing increased pressure on the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court to weigh in\u00a0on the hot-button issue.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/south-carolina-gender-affirming-care-ban-minors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

After a brief, confused\u00a0silence, he smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right, of course,\u201d\u00a0the onetime candidate for New York governor said.\u00a0\u201cForgot about that.\u201d He\u2019s not the only one. Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial, which began eight days ago in the nearby US District Court, has been an afterthought to just about everyone \u2013 Republican, Democrat, hot dog vendor \u2013 in this maze of government buildings, bodegas, tiny green parks and chain coffee shops. The New Jersey Democrat has been charged by federal prosecutors with accepting\u00a0bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars\u00a0\u2013\u00a0some of the payments\u00a0allegedly\u00a0delivered in the form of gold bars\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in exchange for assorted favors for a trio of\u00a0local businessmen and two foreign governments and\u00a0then\u00a0conspiring to cover it up\u00a0after being indicted. The 70-year-old has insisted on his innocence, as have his two co-defendants, who have also pleaded not guilty. In a different place and time, the trial of a sitting\u00a0member of the US Senate\u00a0\u2013 who until recently chaired the chamber\u2019s powerful Foreign Relations Committee \u2013 would dominate\u00a0the local tabloids, be the center of a national partisan melee and appear,\u00a0at\u00a0least occasionally,\u00a0on the itinerary of Republicans gathering daily about a tenth of a mile away. But this is 2024, a presidential election year, and\u00a0 Trump \u2013 with former fixer Michael Cohen and porn star Stormy Daniels captivating in supporting roles \u2013 often feels like the only show in town. So it goes for Menendez,\u00a0who is likely pleased to have his legal drama playing out in relative obscurity. It\u2019s a similar dynamic for his Democratic colleagues as they navigate the final months of his term and, as most\u00a0political\u00a0observers expect, their 51-49 Senate majority. On Tuesday, as a witness for the prosecution in the\u00a0senator\u2019s\u00a0case testified about his role in delivering what he called a loan of more than $20,000, with no interest attached, to Menendez\u2019s\u00a0now-wife from one of the co-defendants, a laundry list of Republican lawmakers and Trump pals, led by Donald Trump Jr., held court with\u00a0reporters\u00a0around the corner. Their message echoed that of the rotating cast of\u00a0loyalists\u00a0who have argued during breaks in Trump\u2019s trial that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, at the direction of vengeful Democratic partisans, is using \u201clawfare\u201d reminiscent of\u00a0what\u00a0Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson\u00a0called\u00a0\u201cevery little tin-pot dictatorship across the world\u201d against the\u00a0once\u00a0and future GOP presidential nominee. \u201cWhen (Trump-friendly witness) Bob Costello was trying to answer on cross-examination today, the prosecutors were cutting him off. They didn\u2019t want him to tell the full truth,\u201d former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said\u00a0Tuesday, her voice nearly drowned out by chanting from Trump supporters gathered in an adjacent park. Shortly afterward, similar remarks by\u00a0Missouri Sen. Eric\u00a0Schmitt were cut off by a passerby,\u00a0who stopped to vigorously declare Donald Trump Jr. \u201ca phony\u00a0m*therf**ker.\u201d Others taking\u00a0their\u00a0turns included the former president\u2019s son, former\u00a0acting US\u00a0Attorney General Matt Whitaker, former\u00a0Trump adviser\u00a0Sebastian Gorka, Texas\u00a0Lt. Gov.\u00a0Dan Patrick, Jackson, and Reps.\u00a0Mar\u00eda\u00a0Elvira\u00a0Salazar of Florida, Troy Nehls of Texas, Dale Strong of Alabama and Daniel Webster of Florida. None of the speakers made mention of Menendez, nor\u00a0of\u00a0the allegations of the Democrat\u2019s dealings with the Egyptian\u00a0government\u00a0and its functionaries.\u00a0Instead they summoned the likes of North Korea and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia to add a slap of color to the injustices, they said,\u00a0that\u00a0now confront\u00a0the former president. In the nearly nine months since Menendez was indicted \u2013 making him the first US\u00a0senator\u00a0to be charged in two separate criminal cases \u2013 his most\u00a0outspoken\u00a0critics have come from\u00a0within his own ranks. Democrats in New Jersey, including Sen. Cory Booker, have largely abandoned him. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did not call on Menendez to step down after the indictment landed, though he expressed contentment that his longtime colleague decided to cede his Foreign Relations Committee\u00a0post. More than any Republican, Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, has been the most vocal of any elected official in Washington, describing Menendez as \u201creally a senator for Egypt, not New Jersey.\u201d Late last year, he trolled\u00a0his colleague by hiring former New York Rep. George Santos, who had just been expelled from Congress over a dazzling assortment of\u00a0alleged\u00a0lies and\u00a0misdeeds, to record a video on the Cameo app calling for Menendez\u00a0to go. More recently,\u00a0Fetterman\u00a0mocked the senator\u2019s\u00a0defense, which relies in part on pointing the finger of blame on Nadine Menendez, his wife. \u201cI really can\u2019t imagine who \u2013 either it was his idea or he was convinced that blaming your wife, who is suffering from cancer, is really an effective strategy or how that\u2019s going to go over,\u201d Fetterman told on CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u00a0on\u00a0Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d (Per a press release from her husband, Nadine Menendez, who is also charged in the case and is set to be tried separately this summer, has been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and will undergo a mastectomy.) Republicans in Washington, as they\u2019ve done during these first two weeks of the Menendez trial in New York, have been consistently deferential to the New Jersey Democrat. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in September called the indictment \u201can issue for the Democrats to deal with.\u201d Other GOP officials went so far as\u00a0to encourage\u00a0Menendez, a staunch, pro-Israel foreign policy hawk, to hold on to his seat as long as he was able. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing for Republicans,\u201d North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer told Politico last year. \u201cHaving a Democrat who is so hawkish as a chairman is kind of an encouragement.\u201d Their tune, of course, could change if a Republican Senate candidate in New Jersey emerges as a serious contender. (The GOP primary hopefuls so far, however, largely appear to be toeing the Trump line \u2013 not exactly a winning strategy in the true-blue Garden State.) Menendez is not running for\u00a0reelection\u00a0in the Democratic primary and an independent bid, which he\u2019s teased, seems far-fetched. Rep. Andy Kim, a popular Democrat from South Jersey, is expected to win the nomination to\u00a0succeed Menendez. But on a steamy May morning in New York City, Menendez\u2019s fate\u00a0was, at most, a distant concern.\u00a0Andrew\u00a0Giuliani, pressed for a thought on the senator\u2019s trial or the allegations against him, shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a better explanation for the gold bars for the defense, I guess. But I just haven\u2019t been following it as much as this here,\u201d he said, asking a reporter, \u201cWhat is it,\u00a0in the second or third week?\u201d CNN\u2019s Sabrina Souza contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/bob-menendez-trump-circus-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
