{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_alito-supreme-court-tape-analysis", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito really wasn\u2019t caught. The religious zeal reflected in the surreptitious recordings made public this week has long been evident in Alito\u2019s statements and written opinions. But his remarks, captured secretly by a liberal activist presenting herself as a conservative Catholic, reinforce the pretense regarding any neutrality. Alito was notably cavalier about his views at a moment when he already faces public scrutiny over the provocative flags flown at his homes. And as much as Alito\u2019s new comments reflected his broader approach to the law, they also stood in contrast to Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 measured response when he was similarly baited at the Supreme Court Historical Society gala dinner last week. An overriding question as the justices near the end of the 2023-24 session is how Alito\u2019s attitudes will manifest themselves in rulings, including those that could affect\u00a0the presidential election. Even before the latest revelations on Monday, tensions behind the scenes were high and relationships among\u00a0the justices were frayed. To reach majority decisions, the justices must work toward compromise, even as extracurricular ethical issues cause strains and drive them apart. The new recordings also reveal conversations with the justice\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann Alito. She is heard defiantly speaking of the flags hoisted at the Alito family homes, a subject of controversy because some of former President Donald Trump\u2019s backers and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d campaign have flown such flags, including at the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021. Trump is directly in front of the high court this month, as the justices are deciding whether the former president\u00a0should be immune from criminal prosecution on election-subversion charges arising from the 2020 presidential contest and Trump\u2019s enduring challenge to President Joe Biden\u2019s valid election. The presidential campaign could also be shaped\u00a0by two disputes over access to abortion. Alito wrote the high court\u2019s 2022 opinion reversing the constitutional right to end a pregnancy. The new cases test the remaining availability of abortion, for example, through medication that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Alito\u2019s us vs. them attitude on religion Alito, 74, is one of six Roman Catholics on the nine-member bench. More than most of his colleagues, he has not shied from headlining religious-sponsored events or quoting scripture. Themes of religious conservatism have permeated his opinions. He has opposed abortion rights, gay marriage and LGBTQ equality. The new recordings, first made public by Rolling Stone Monday, capture Alito endorsing the suggestion of activist Lauren Windsor that \u201cpeople in this country who believe in God have got to keep fighting for that \u2013 to return our country to a place of Godliness.\u201d Alito responded, \u201cWell, I agree with you, I agree with you.\u201d Windsor, a progressive activist and documentary filmmaker, portrayed herself in private with Alito as\u00a0on the far right. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we can negotiate with the left in the way that, like, needs to happen for the polarization to end,\u201d she told him. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a matter of, like, winning.\u201d Alito answered,\u00a0\u201cI think you\u2019re probably right. \u2026 One side or the other is going to win. I don\u2019t know. I mean, there can be a way of working, a way of living together peacefully, but it\u2019s difficult, you know, because there are differences on fundamental things that really can\u2019t be compromised. They really can\u2019t be compromised. So, it\u2019s not like you are going to split the difference.\u201d Over the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted. In a 2022 speech in Rome, a few weeks after he wrote the Supreme Court majority decision reversing the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade, Alito declared:\u00a0\u201cReligious liberty is under attack in many places because it is dangerous to those who want to hold complete power. It also probably grows out of something dark and deep in the human DNA \u2013 a tendency to distrust and dislike people who are not like ourselves.\u201d Earlier, during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic and government mandates against crowded indoor gatherings, Alito lamented \u201cpreviously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty,\u201d including \u201cchurches closed on Easter Sunday, synagogues closed for Passover and Yom Kippur.\u201d Alito\u2019s tone of aggrievement has deepened, even as he has more and more been on the winning side of religious disputes at the high court. With his vote and the bolstered conservative majority, the Supreme Court has increasingly blurred the separation of church and state. In recent years,\u00a0the court favored a public high school football coach who prayed on the field after games; ruled that state tuition-assistance programs open to public and private schools must cover religious institutions; and sided with a website designer who, based on her Christian beliefs, wanted to refuse to design wedding sites for same-sex couples. Last month in a speech to graduates of Franciscan University in\u00a0Steubenville, Ohio, Alito said, \u201cFreedom of religion is also\u00a0imperiled. When you venture out into the world you may well find yourself in a job or a community or a social setting when you will be pressured to endorse ideas you don\u2019t believe, or to abandon core beliefs. It will be up to you to stand firm.\u201d Alito evidently saw a fellow traveler in Windsor. Not so for Roberts, extremely cautious in any setting. Windsor tried to entice Roberts with comments about the United States as a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know that we live in a Christian nation,\u201d Roberts is heard responding. \u201cI know a lot of Jewish and Muslim friends who would say maybe not.\u201d In the\u00a0brief recording clips\u00a0made public\u00a0by Windsor, Roberts takes pains to separate the role\u00a0of judge from advocacy, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to do that. It\u2019s our job to decide the cases as best we can.\u201d \u2018I have to look across the lagoon at the Pride flag\u2019 Neither Alito nor Roberts responded to CNN requests for comment. Alito also did not respond to a request related to the remarks of his wife, who was especially loquacious as Windsor drew her in. Windsor told Martha-Ann Alito that she was a \u201cfan\u201d of her husband, and that\u00a0her critics were \u201cpersecuting\u201d her. On the recording, Windsor expressed sympathy for Martha-Ann, who flew at her suburban Virginia home an upside-down US flag after Trump lost the presidential election, and apparently in the middle of a political quarrel with neighbors.\u00a0She also flew an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at their home on the New Jersey shore. Martha-Ann said she wished she could counter a gay-rights flag being flown in celebration of June \u201cPride\u201d month. \u201cYou know what I want? I want a Sacred Heart of Jesus flag because I have to look across the lagoon at the Pride flag for the next month,\u201d she told Windsor. And in an apparent reference to Justice Alito, she added, \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, please don\u2019t put up a flag.\u2019 I said, \u2018I won\u2019t do it, because I\u2019m deferring to you. But when you are free of this nonsense, I\u2019m putting it up and I\u2019m going to send them a message every day, maybe every week I\u2019ll be changing the flags.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the view of the justice\u2019s wife, at least as it regards the flags. Justice Alito asserted\u00a0in a May 29 letter to congressional leaders who sought his recusal from cases involving Trump, \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags. I am not.\u201d Yet, there is likely little distance between them on religion. And these recordings from Justice Alito\u2019s private conversations serve as a reminder of where he has been most publicly and overtly reshaping the law in America.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/alito-supreme-court-tape-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_felons-inmates-voting-what-matters", "text": "Both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, face sentencing for nonviolent felonies before Election Day. Although it seems unlikely either will be behind bars on November 5, it\u2019s worth noting that how and whether felons and people otherwise detained can cast election ballots has developed into a major civil rights issue in recent years. The rules for how felons, inmates and those facing trial can cast ballots vary from state to state, and a number of recently enacted laws and ballot initiatives will change things further in 2024. In California, where Hunter Biden lives, for instance, only people who are serving time in prison are ineligible to vote, according to a database maintained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In Delaware, where he was convicted in federal court, there are more restrictions on felons voting. In Florida, where Trump lives, there are more restrictions on felons voting than in New York, where Trump was convicted in state court. There are only a few places \u2013 Vermont, Maine and the District of Colombia \u2013 where everyone can vote, even if they\u2019re convicted felons serving time in prison. Everywhere else in the US places prohibitions on incarcerated felons, and some states include other prohibitions. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Kimberly Berryman traveled to Nevada, where Tuesday was primary day and, for the first time, people who are detained, for a variety of reasons, were able to vote despite their incarceration. They met inmates casting ballots for the first time in their lives. Watch their full report. Nevada\u2019s state government gave felons who\u00a0have been released from prison the ability to vote back in 2019. That still left a population of people who are not convicted of a felony but are detained in jail in the lurch. A new law passed this year in Nevada required jails to facilitate access to voting for those non-felons inside jails in the state. Tuesday\u2019s primary was the first test. \u201cTheir vote should not be any less important than the individuals that are out here,\u201d Sadmira Ramic, a voting rights staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, told Murray and Berryman. \u201cThey face those barriers that we here on the outside don\u2019t even really think about.\u201d One major issue is confusion. Unfounded allegations of illegitimate and illegal votes or outright rigged elections have caused confusion among inmates about where they stand, so they often don\u2019t vote at all. For instance, despite Florida voters overwhelmingly agreeing in 2018 to reenfranchise felons in that state, a series of actions by the legislature complicated voting for felons, leading to court battles and confusion. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, made a show of trying to prosecute people for illegally voting in 2022. The ACLU has worked with voting rights groups in Nevada to make sure detained people who have the right to vote can access that right this year, but at one point threatened a lawsuit in order to make sure access to polling booths was granted by primary day. In a presidential election that could be decided by a small fraction of votes in key states like Nevada, even a small number of additional votes could, in theory, change the outcome. Nevada is also the site of a hotly contested Senate race that could determine which party controls the Senate next year. Jagada Chambers, a former inmate who is now a rights restoration coordinator for Silver State Voices, a voting rights group, told Murray and Berryman she hopes politicians will see the potential of asking for the votes of people who are detained. \u201cIn Clark County, you have potential victories lying in those cells,\u201d Chambers said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/felons-inmates-voting-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_biden-israel-hostage-rescue-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s power to engineer a swift abatement of the war between Israel and Hamas just suffered two serious new blows. Fallout from an Israeli special forces rescue mission in Gaza, which retrieved four hostages but killed scores of Palestinian civilians, and the resignation of centrist Benny Gantz from Israel\u2019s war cabinet on Sunday sharpened political and diplomatic dilemmas Biden has struggled for months to reconcile. \u2022 The return of four hostages was a moment of joy for their families, and for all Israelis, and was welcomed by the United States. But the humanitarian toll of the operation underscores the carnage Israel has inflicted on civilians often used by Hamas as human shields in the war, which erupted with the radical Islamic group\u2019s assault on Israel on October 7. \u2022 The latest bloodshed in Gaza could further estrange Biden from progressives in his electoral coalition who are outraged at his support for Israel, its operations and its failure to do more to shield civilians. Any significant drop-off in votes from this constituency could endanger Biden in swing states where his rematch against Donald Trump could be decided by thousands of votes. The issue is especially fraught in Michigan, a potentially decisive state in November, which is home to significant numbers of Arab Americans. Vice President Kamala Harris was confronted by a protester during an appearance in the key swing state on Saturday night as she welcomed the hostage release while mourning civilians who were killed. \u2022 The rescue mission also emphasizes the disparity in the death toll between Palestinians and Israelis in the conflict. This is likely to further isolate Israel internationally from nations horrified by the Hamas attacks and to inject further tension between Washington and its allies over the war. Around 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks, while thousands of Palestinians have died in Gaza. \u2022 Gaza\u2019s bloodiest day in six months, according to authorities there, could also further narrow the political room available to key Arab states involved in the intense US diplomatic efforts to end the fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is nevertheless headed back to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Qatar this week to try to hike pressure on Hamas to agree a deal. New turmoil in Israeli politics The resignation of Gantz, a retired army general who said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has no plans for ultimate victory in Gaza or what happens afterward, will have significant domestic and international consequences but is unlikely to transform Israeli politics. \u2022 Gantz\u2019s party is not a member of the prime minister\u2019s governing coalition, so his departure is unlikely to immediately bring Netanyahu down. If Netanyahu were eventually brought down, it would likely please the Biden administration because of tensions with the prime minister, his refusal to accept US calls to do more to shield Palestinian civilians and his willingness to side with Republicans using the conflict to damage Biden. \u2022 But the loss of Gantz could make Netanyahu more reliant on hard-right members of his coalition who have been pushing him for an even more intense prosecution of the war. That could raise the risks of escalation, which could intensify the simmering wider regional war in which the US is involved. \u2022 The absence of Gantz may also create an even greater obstacle to approval of any peace deal between Israel and Hamas. Besides Netanyahu, the only remaining member of the emergency government with decision-making power is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, also from the prime minister\u2019s Likud party. \u2022 The fracturing of the Israeli war cabinet and Gantz\u2019s call for elections could have unpredictable consequences in Israel amid rising protests against Netanyahu. Thousands of people showed up this weekend in marches in multiple cities calling for the release of the remaining hostages and the chance to vote. Biden\u2019s Middle East problem never seems to get better The latest twist in the Gaza conflict came with Biden in France on a trip marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, which he used to warn of growing threats to global democracy and to toughen his political attacks on Trump and the ex-president\u2019s increasingly obvious authoritarian tendencies. National security adviser Jake Sullivan encapsulated the administration\u2019s complex political and diplomatic conundrum in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Speaking against a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower on Sunday, he told Dana Bash the US \u201cdid not participate militarily\u201d in the operation to rescue the four Israeli hostages after a US official earlier said that an American \u201ccell\u201d in Israel took part in efforts to free hostages. Sullivan said US assets had been supporting Israel in helping to identify the locations of those held following the October 7 attacks. Sullivan also reinforced US calls for a ceasefire, despite doubts that Hamas will agree to one and a belief among some Democrats in Washington that Netanyahu may seek to prolong the war to bolster his hopes of political survival. Washington has been tireless in the search for a halt to the fighting. But its failure to create a breakthrough raises questions about US leverage and Biden\u2019s prestige on the world stage five months from Election Day. \u201cThe best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cInnocent people were tragically killed in this operation,\u201d Sullivan added. \u201cThe exact number we don\u2019t know, but innocent people were killed. And that is heartbreaking. That is tragic.\u201d But the national security adviser\u2019s comments will do nothing to ease Biden\u2019s domestic political exposure over the war. The administration is caught between his left flank and Republicans who have strong political incentives to damage Biden and to deepen ties with their far-right ideological partner Netanyahu. The president\u2019s impossible straddle is likely to become even more testing when Netanyahu takes up on July 24 an invitation to address Congress, which was signed by all four congressional leaders but initiated by Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Biden has been incessantly heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters at campaign events since the war erupted, and any large demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August could create poor optics and play into Trump\u2019s narrative that a law enforcement crackdown is needed in out-of-control cities. Sen. Tom Cotton voiced the GOP\u2019s hardline on the conflict when he said Sunday on Fox News that he\u2019d spoken to Netanyahu to congratulate him on the raid. The Arkansas Republican also chided \u201cthe progressive left here in America, to include The New York Times and Washington Post\u201d for highlighting the loss of large numbers of innocent civilians killed during the Israeli operation. While casting doubt on the casualty figures, Cotton said on Fox News, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want your people killed in hostage rescue missions, then you shouldn\u2019t take hostages in the first place.\u201d Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said at least 274 people were killed and hundreds were wounded during the IDF\u2019s operation to free four Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the health ministry\u2019s figures. Israel\u2019s political crisis deepens in a way that will test Biden Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, said he was pulling out of Netanyahu\u2019s government because the prime minister put personal political considerations ahead of post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, and he called on the prime minister to hold an election. \u201cDo not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. Netanyahu had called on Gantz to stay. But his departure doesn\u2019t immediately imperil the governing coalition, which still has 64 seats in the 120-member Knesset. The hostage rescue raid and new turbulence in Israeli politics follow Biden\u2019s latest bid to end the war last month when he publicly laid out a three-phase peace plan that would begin with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages and more humanitarian relief in Gaza. His call was endorsed by G7 leaders and was seen by some analysts as an attempt to box in Netanyahu since the deal originally came from the Israelis. In response, Netanyahu insisted the war would not end until Hamas was defeated. Hamas responded positively. Netanyahu\u2019s legendary staying power and the reality of the political calendar means there\u2019s a strong chance Biden will be forced to deal with the prime minister for the rest of his reelection campaign amid a conflict that could end both their political careers. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East peace negotiator for multiple US presidents, said Sunday on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d that the Israeli prime minister would try to run out the US political clock since the Knesset goes into recess on July 25 and doesn\u2019t return until shortly before the US election. \u201cI think he is going to try to buy time before then and make a judgment on how he wants to comport himself with respect to the next US president,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote in our election, but if he could, I suspect if he wouldn\u2019t be voting for Joe Biden.\u201d Biden has argued that Israel has degraded Hamas to such an extent that it should now begin to contemplate the security end game for Gaza. Some US experts believe it will be impossible to fully eradicate Hamas. But the group seems unlikely to embrace a permanent peace deal that would lead to it losing power in Gaza \u2014 one reason why the situation is so intractable. \u201cIn order to beat Hamas politically, you\u2019ve got to introduce another element here. The Saudis, the [United Arab Emirates], and the other Arab governments are willing to do it. You\u2019re going to need some role for the Palestinian Authority,\u201d Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday. \u201cPresident Biden made it clear that the United States will be a partner, but it needs Israel to pivot to that place. But it\u2019s unwilling to, so I think what we\u2019ll likely to see is the war in Gaza continue for some time, albeit at a lower level,\u201d Haass added. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at probably a long, slow grind in Gaza.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/biden-israel-hostage-rescue-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The measure, which cleared the simple majority needed to amend the state\u2019s constitution with 61% support, is likely to face legal challenges, and it will not immediately affect North Dakota\u2019s current congressional delegation, all three of whom are under the age of 70. But Tuesday\u2019s vote is likely reflective of growing concerns about the age of top US leadership. President Joe Biden, who is 81, has faced a\u00a0stubborn\u00a0political challenge\u00a0due to his age as he seeks reelection, and his presumptive Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, turns 78 on Friday. The late Sen.

But, of course, there\u2019s a limit, to where we all face a decline of some kind at some point. And so, we wanted to try to find the right balance. We thought 80 was the balance,\u201d Hendrix told\u00a0PBS News Hour\u00a0ahead of the vote.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_supreme-court-second-amendment-hunter-biden-rahimi-appeal", "text": "Hunter Biden\u2019s historic conviction on three felony gun charges will add significant weight to a blockbuster Second Amendment appeal to be decided in coming days by the Supreme Court. Though the case deals with different circumstances and a different provision of a federal gun law, the high court\u2019s decision this month on whether authorities may ban domestic abusers from owning guns could signal a path forward for Biden\u2019s anticipated appeal \u2013 or make it harder for him to overturn his conviction. \u201cI definitely think they\u2019re connected,\u201d Jacob Charles, a law professor at Pepperdine University who focuses on the Second Amendment, said of the pending Supreme Court case and possible Biden appeal. \u201cOne possible outcome is that the court limits the gun prohibitions to people who are found to be dangerous in some way.\u201d Such a decision could give Biden an opening. Hunter Biden was found guilty of three felony gun charges on Tuesday, the first time in American history that a president\u2019s child has been convicted of a crime during their father\u2019s term in office. The charges stem from a federal law that makes it a crime to own a weapon while being an \u201cunlawful user of or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs. The president\u2019s son was convicted of lying on a federal form when he swore he was not using \u2013 and was not addicted to \u2013 drugs as he purchased a revolver at a Delaware gun shop in 2018. He was also convicted of possessing the gun, given that he was struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine at the time. A Rahimi win would give Biden \u2018ammunition\u2019 A related prohibition of the federal disarmament law sits at the center of one of the Supreme Court\u2019s most significant cases this term, US v. Rahimi. That case deals with a part of the law that bars Americans who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns, and it\u2019s being challenged by a criminal defendant in Texas, Zackey Rahimi, and gun rights groups on Second Amendment grounds. Should the Supreme Court rule in favor of Rahimi, Hunter Biden would have \u201ca lot of ammunition\u201d as he challenges his conviction, said Andrew Willinger, the executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law. Because of that, the litigation has put the Democratic president\u2019s son on the same side as gun rights groups seeking to overturn the laws. If Biden challenges the constitutionality of the drug-prohibition on appeal, he will have several rulings working in his favor. In a major Second Amendment decision from 2022, a 6-3 conservative majority ruled that gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition\u201d to survive legal scrutiny. The ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, written by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, has been used by Second Amendment groups to challenge gun laws across the nation. One of those challenges, US v. Daniels, is directly on point with Hunter Biden\u2019s case and is already pending at the Supreme Court. In Daniels, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the federal prohibition on Americans owning guns while addicted to drugs cannot be squared with the nation\u2019s history in the way Thomas called for in Bruen. Biden gun law pending at Supreme Court The case centers on Patrick Daniels Jr., who told Drug Enforcement Administration agents he used pot \u201capproximately fourteen days out of a month.\u201d Daniels was charged with the same federal crime as Biden after police found marijuana cigarette butts, a loaded pistol and a semi-automatic rifle in his car after a traffic stop in 2022. Hunter Biden has already raised the Daniels case in court. Seeking to have his case dismissed last year, Biden noted \u201cthe lack of any historical precedent for disarming citizens based on their status of having used a controlled substance.\u201d District Judge Maryellen Noreika in May denied the request to dismiss the case on those grounds. Though the cases differ and Biden\u2019s federal case is in a different circuit, his attorneys may still use the 5th Circuit ruling in the Daniels\u2019 matter to argue that the law is unconstitutional. But before the Supreme Court deals with Daniels, it must first address Rahimi, which also comes from the conservative, New Orleans-based 5th Circuit. Prosecutors say Rahimi was involved in several shootings in late 2020 to early 2021, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend\u2019s credit card was declined. When police executed a search warrant at his home, they found a .45-caliber pistol, a .308-caliber rifle, ammunition and a copy of a restraining order filed against him. During oral arguments in November, a majority of the justices appeared inclined to uphold the federal law, though it\u2019s possible they do so in a way that limits the prohibition to apply to people courts deem dangerous. The court is expected to rule by the end of the month. Once it rules, the justices will likely return the Daniels case and other pending Second Amendment appeals to lower courts to reconsider their decisions with the new precedent in hand. Biden\u2019s attorneys are likely hoping that \u201cRahimi is going to come down in a way where the majority opinion will be written in very broad terms, in terms that suggest a very expansive Second Amendment right,\u201d said Benjamin Levin, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert on US gun laws. Such a decision might signal, Levin said, \u201cthat some of these restrictions on gun possession for people with other sorts of trouble with the law are just going to be constitutionally suspect.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/supreme-court-second-amendment-hunter-biden-rahimi-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The country\u2019s divergent possible paths under President Joe Biden or presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump were highlighted in the way both men, their families and their political operations reacted to the twin trials and verdicts. Biden made no effort to interfere in the prosecution of his son Hunter with either his executive authority or with the media megaphone of his office. He allowed his own Justice Department to secure a guilty verdict Tuesday that could result in jail time for the recovering addict and hurt his own 2024 campaign. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president said after the jury found his son guilty of lying on a federal background check form and possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. He has already said he won\u2019t pardon his son. In his first reaction to the verdict, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t attack the judge or prosecutors, simply saying he was grateful for the love and support of his family and blessed to be clean again. The Bidens\u2019 comportment contrasted with Trump\u2019s reaction to his own trial and conviction nearly two weeks ago in his hush money case. The ex-president lashed out at witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and the judge. He claimed that \u201cthis was done by (the) Biden administration in order to wound or hurt a political opponent.\u201d He blasted \u201ca rigged decision,\u201d despite the fact the Justice Department was not involved in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney. Since then, Trump has been warning he\u2019d use presidential powers to punish his political opponents and bend the legal system to his will. \u201cSometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump told TV psychologist Phil McGraw last week. \u201cI have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d The former president told Fox News last week, \u201cI would have every right to go after them,\u201d referring to the Bidens. Two Trump claims discredited by Hunter Biden verdict Throughout his trial in Manhattan, his former hometown, Trump, insisted he couldn\u2019t get a fair verdict in a city that votes mostly Democratic. But Delaware is a blue state \u2014 and a jury there just convicted the president\u2019s son. One juror told CNN Tuesday that politics never came up in the deliberations. Jurors in Trump\u2019s trial have yet to speak, perhaps because of fears they could be identified following the ex-president\u2019s intimidation tactics. Had Biden been acquitted, Republicans would surely have argued that a biased jury in a state where everyone seems to know the first family had proven their point. But the guilty verdict blew another of their political arguments out of the water. Joe Biden came to office pledging to restore the independence of the Justice Department following Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to employ its legal and investigative powers almost as a personal law firm during his term. But the former president has left no doubt that he\u2019d do the same and more if he wins back the White House in November and would ignore the DOJ\u2019s core mission statement of enforcing the law with \u201cindependence and Impartiality.\u201d Trump has already vowed to prosecute Biden and his family and to \u201cobliterate\u201d what he calls the \u201cDeep State.\u201d Several outside groups have drawn up plans to help him. The Hunter Biden verdict also contradicted the central rationale of Trump\u2019s multiple legal defenses in his four criminal cases, several civil matters and his entire presidential campaign. This is the false notion that he is a victim of a weaponized legal system by a Justice Department that exclusively targets Republicans. \u201cSo much for the weaponization of the Justice Department to go after just the enemies of the other side,\u201d Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official and federal prosecutor, said on CNN Max on Tuesday. \u201cThis is testament to the fact the Justice Department under (Attorney General Merrick) Garland is trying its very best to steer straight down the middle as it should and bring people to trial that it thinks are worthy of prosecution.\u201d The notion of Justice Department neutrality was bolstered by post-trial comments from David Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware whom Garland elevated to  special counsel to avoid the impression of political bias. Weiss thanked the attorney general for allowing him to act independently. And, he added, in a coda to two fraught weeks that have dragged the justice system into toxic political waters, that \u201cno one in this country is above the law. Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant.\u201d However, Weiss added: \u201cHunter Biden should be no more accountable than any other citizen convicted of this same conduct.\u201d Ken Buck, a former Republican member of Congress, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that Joe Biden had handled the painful matter of his son\u2019s trial and conviction appropriately. \u201c(He did) a great job in trying to stay above the fray and recognizing that his Justice Department was in a very difficult position. People look at this case and realize it was done in an independent and fair way.\u201d Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor and CNN political analyst, said the criminal convictions of Trump and Hunter Biden reflected the huge stakes in November\u2019s election. \u201cNot only is (Joe Biden) saying, the decision is also one that comes from the courts, he\u2019s not saying he\u2019s going to use presidential power to somehow issue a pardon. And you contrast that with the former president who\u2019s attacked the legal system. He\u2019s questioned its legitimacy.\u201d Zelizer added: \u201cVoters will have to make a choice. What kind of response do they want? And what kind of person do they want in the Oval Office come January of 2025?\u201d The idea that the Justice Department is only going after Republicans is not just belied by the Hunter Biden conviction in the gun case and a looming tax trial that awaits him in September. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey is on trial in New York for bribery and corruption. The Justice Department in May indicted another well-known Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, and his wife for allegedly accepting around $600,000 from Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil firm and a Mexican bank in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress. Both Democrats have maintained their innocence. Nevertheless, House Republicans are scheduled to hold a vote on Wednesday on holding Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of President  Biden\u2019s interviews with former special\u00a0counsel Robert Hur. Biden has asserted executive privilege over the files. The truth is unlikely to change the GOP Biden narrative Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin highlighted the contrast between Trump and Biden. \u201cThe Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don\u2019t like the way one case came out. Whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don\u2019t hear a single Democrat crying foul,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. Yet one lesson of the Trump-era is that the truth rarely matters. The revealing of inconvenient facts never penetrates the echo chamber that dominates Republican politics and conservative media. So rather than being chastened by the collapse of the Trump persecution narrative and the successful application of the rule of law in a criminal trial, Trump supporters in Congress merely used the Biden verdict to conjure a new round of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. House Oversight Chairman James Comer said the Delaware trial was \u201ca step toward accountability.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican warned that Justice Department officials were continuing to \u201ccover for the Big Guy, Joe Biden.\u201d Comer repeated accusations that the president had profited from his son\u2019s ethically questionable business operations in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president despite the failure of his committee and the House GOP impeachment probe to find any such evidence. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach. \u201cWe will continue to demand accountability for the corrupt business dealings of the Biden family,\u201d said the Louisiana Republican, a firm supporter of Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s loss in a recent civil case that found that he, his adult sons and his organization had committed massive insurance and banking fraud. Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former White House domestic policy adviser, argued that the Justice Department had actually shown favoritism toward Hunter Biden by not charging him with 50 felonies over foreign influence peddling. The department should \u201ctell him his only way out of life in prison is to testify against the BIG GUY,\u201d Miller said on X. Some of the GOP reaction to Biden becoming a convicted felon was bizarre. One of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, baselessly suggested on X that a verdict produced by a jury of his peers was some kind of elaborate plot. \u201cHunter Biden just became the Deep State\u2019s sacrificial lamb to show that Justice is \u2018balanced\u2019 while the other Biden crimes remain ignored,\u201d she wrote on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-son-trial-analysis", "text": "It would be devastating for any parent to see a child convicted of a crime. To experience it as president before the eyes of the world, during one of the most contentious reelection campaigns in history, would be unfathomable. But that is the ordeal now confronting President Joe Biden after his only surviving son Hunter was found guilty on all counts in a trial in Delaware over his possession of a gun while being addicted to drugs. The jury delivered its verdict Tuesday less than two weeks after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump learned he had been convicted of all 34 counts in a hush money trial in New York. The double convictions represent a remarkable departure from traditional presidential campaigns. Never has a former president and presumptive major party nominee been convicted of a crime. Nor has the child of a sitting president. Both Hunter Biden and Trump pleaded not guilty. Biden\u2019s statement at the start of the trial \u2014 that \u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad\u201d \u2014 encapsulated the tension of his role as the titular head of the nation\u2019s justice system and the pain he would naturally endure from seeing a cherished son, who has dealt with addiction and worked hard to recover, go on trial in the middle of a media storm. Biden repeated that poignant line in a statement issued immediately after the verdict. And unlike former president Trump after his verdict, Biden accepted the jury\u2019s judgment and the integrity of the legal system. \u201cJill and\u00a0I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The Hunter Biden conviction is the latest cruel twist in the story of a family that has endured more tragedies than most could bear. The story of how the future president lost his first wife and infant daughter as a newly elected senator in the early 1970s and brought up his sons with his second wife, the current first lady, has become part of Biden\u2019s personal political mythology. Nearly a decade ago, Biden suffered the loss of his elder son Beau, who had brain cancer. The president\u2019s grief remains raw and often comes to the surface during public events. The trial of Hunter Biden is also occurring at a moment when the president is already under extreme pressure, amid an intensifying reelection campaign in which he is facing an opponent who he warns is bent on destroying American democracy. Biden\u2019s personal burden is, meanwhile, being exacerbated by the fact that at 81, he\u2019s the oldest president in history and opponents highlight every slip or senior moment to charge he\u2019s unfit for office. He just returned from Europe on Sunday, but heads back Wednesday for the G7 summit. And his critical first debate with Trump, on CNN on June 27, will provide the kind of test of his mental faculties and emotional fortitude to match anything any modern president seeking reelection has faced. Two vastly different cases thrust into the same political maelstrom The Hunter Biden and Trump cases are vastly different, as is the way the former and current first families have responded to the trials. For instance, there have been no daily rants by the president\u2019s son about a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d judge. Trump\u2019s conviction for falsifying financial records to cover up a payment to an adult film star, by contrast, prompted the ex-president to warn of retribution. He\u2019s also absurdly claimed he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident who compares to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela. In the latest stage of his legal morass, Trump sat through an online pre-sentencing meeting Monday that came two days after he used his Truth Social network to launch a fresh assault on the probity of the verdict he has vowed to appeal. \u201cThese are not legitimate trials; they are merely part of an illegal POLITICAL WITCH HUNT the likes of which our Country has never seen before!\u201d Trump wrote. The former president\u2019s sentencing has been set for July 11, just a few days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s sentencing is not expected to occur until October. Joe Biden, who has said he is trying to restore faith in the justice system after the Trump presidency, said in a solemn ABC News interview that he won\u2019t pardon his son. This is especially significant since Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, although a sentence for a first-time offender is unlikely to be that severe. First families in the spotlight While cameras were barred from the courtroom in both trials, each unfolded against a backdrop of taut political drama and the glare of publicity surrounding the former and current first families. The ex-president\u2019s adult sons Eric and Donald Jr. sometimes attended court in New York. And crowds of GOP lawmakers \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 were eager to embroider the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s claims that he was a victim of politicized justice in what amounts to an attack on the rule of law by a major American political party. Former first lady Melania Trump did not attend. Biden has stayed away from his son\u2019s trial in Wilmington, but first lady Jill Biden has led a gathering of the clan at the courthouse for the last week. She crossed the Atlantic four times last week, balancing her official role alongside her husband at D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations and in a state visit to France with her desire to be with her son in his hour of greatest need. In one striking moment in the trial\u2019s closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors drawn from a state where many families have a story about interacting with the Bidens that they should draw no inference from the first family\u2019s rock-solid bond and presence at the trial. \u201cPeople sitting in the gallery are not evidence. You may recognize them from the news \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d\u00a0Wise added: \u201cYour decision can only be made on evidence.\u201d The infringements on the Biden family\u2019s dignity and privacy cut deep during the trial, which saw discomforting testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s former cocaine addiction. Beau Biden\u2019s widow, Hallie, who had a relationship with Hunter as they grieved, testified about their joint cocaine use that she said now embarrasses and shames her. In a heart-rending scene, the accused\u2019s daughter, Naomi, was brought to the stand by the defense, then came under a rigorous cross-examination from prosecutors. The way addiction ravages loved ones as well as the user was laid bare when a text from Naomi to her father reading, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad, I can\u2019t take this,\u201d was introduced into evidence. Media organizations, meanwhile, played an excerpt from Hunter Biden\u2019s audio book that chronicles his spiral into addiction that was used in the prosecution case. Two politicized trials with critical differences Given the identities of those involved and the fraught national moment in the middle of a bitterly contested general election, there\u2019s no way the Trump and Hunter Biden trials could not have become politicized. Trump has claimed that he\u2019s the victim of a vendetta by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, though he was indicted by a grand jury, enjoyed the presumption of innocence like any other accused felon and was judged by a jury of his peers. When Biden\u2019s plea deal collapsed in the court of a Trump-appointed judge and when Attorney General Merrick Garland made David Weiss, the prosecutor investigating Biden, a special counsel, some Democrats asked whether Republican pressure designed to damage the president had weighed on the renewed push for a trial. But both trials have been conducted according to the rules of evidence and provided expansive protections for the accused. And the same bedrock American principle that was cited by prosecutors in the Trump hush money trial was used by Wise in his summation on Monday. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d he said, urging jurors not to treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d There is a critical difference between the two trials that debunks much of the political noise around them. Hunter Biden, unlike Trump, did not serve as president and has no chance of sitting in the Oval Office as commander in chief on January 20. While Biden is facing serious charges and will go on trial again in September in a separate tax case, his alleged offenses have nothing to do with the Constitution or threats to democracy. Trump\u2019s charges, however, focus on alleged mishandling of national security documents that he hoarded at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office. He has also been charged in two separate cases \u2014 one federal and one in Georgia \u2014 with the ultimate crime in a democracy: seeking to overturn the will of voters. The former president is waiting for a US Supreme Court ruling on his sweeping claims of immunity arising from the federal election interference case that, if the court rules his way and he wins a second term, could augur a presidency of almost no constraints that could verge on autocracy. The second distinction lies in the fact that Joe Biden\u2019s behavior is not an issue in the criminal cases against his son. And House Republicans have so far failed to find that the president benefited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals in nations like Ukraine and China while his father was vice president \u2014 even if the younger Biden\u2019s activity raises serious ethical questions.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_jimmy-carter-virtue-in-politics-cec", "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter shocked voters in 1976 when he\u00a0admitted during\u202fa Playboy magazine interview that he had \u201clooked on a lot of women with lust\u201d and \u201ccommitted adultery in my heart many times.\u201d Carter, who was running for the presidency at the time, would narrowly win his White House bid. But he would later\u202fsay\u202fthat public outrage over his confession \u201cnearly cost me the election.\u201d The 99-year-old Carter, in hospice care and \u201ccoming to the end\u201d of his days, is a\u00a0humanitarian and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. He embodied virtue \u2014\u00a0defined\u202fas moral and civic excellence. Yet his one-term presidency is considered by many an \u201cepic\u202ffailure.\u201d If you want to know how political culture has changed since Carter\u2019s time, though, consider the contrast between the soft-spoken Georgian and another recent president. Former President Donald Trump was found\u202fguilty\u202flast month on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to\u202fcover up\u202fa sex scandal involving a porn star. He is the first former president in US history to be convicted of a felony.\u00a0Despite that, polls\u202fshow Trump has a\u00a0good shot\u202fat\u202fbeing elected again this November. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the fallout from Trump\u2019s conviction. Commentators ask if the verdict will make a difference in the polls. Will it trigger\u202fpolitical violence?\u00a0How\u202fcan a convicted felon run a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign? But looking at Trump\u2019s conviction through the lens of Carter\u2019s political legacy raises a more disturbing question: What if virtue is overrated in politics? What if former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s famous\u00a0slogan\u202f\u2014 \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d \u2014 was wrong? The phrase went viral after she used it as a rallying cry during a 2016 speech supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Some of the most prominent political leaders in America today seem to excel at going low. They make\u202fexplicitly racist,\u202fsexist\u202fand\u202fantisemitic statements,\u202fand\u202fshred\u202fpolitical norms for partisan gain \u2014 with little apparent dent in popularity, at least among their base of supporters. Perhaps Carter\u2019s final days also herald the passing of another era: when Americans expected their political leaders to demonstrate a certain level of private and public decency. The value of political virtue changed long before Trump CNN raised this question with\u202fsome of the nation\u2019s leading\u202fpolitical scientists and scholars. Their short answer: Virtue matters in ways that many Americans may not realize. Some Americans ascribe virtue in the political realm to leaders such as Carter who avoid scandals triggered by lust or greed. Carter promised the American people he would never lie to them, and cherished and respected his wife Rosalynn of \u202f77 years. There was no whiff of private scandal during his term in office, which ended in early 1981. Political virtue, though, is not just what leaders do \u2014 it\u2019s what citizens demand, says \u202fScott Waller,\u202fchair of the political science department at Biola University in California. \u201cThe issue is not really the standard that Jimmy Carter set in presidential discourse as much as it was a standard that was generally expected from the American people,\u201d Waller says. Waller cites Gary Hart, who was the frontrunner for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination before his campaign imploded after a\u202fscandal\u202fover an extramarital affair. Many Americans thought at the time that Hart\u2019s affair revealed\u202fsomething unsettling about his character that disqualified him from the Oval Office. Such concerns seem almost quaint today, Waller says. A politician today can get criticized for trying to act too virtuously, he says. Waller cites the example of former Vice President Mike Pence, who said he honored his wife in part by refusing to take any private meeting with a woman because it could hint at impropriety. Pence, an evangelical Christian, was following the \u201cBilly Graham Rule,\u201d\u00a0named for the legendary evangelist who would not meet alone with a woman other than his wife to avoid temptation or any appearance of evil. Many pastors also follow that rule today. \u201cInstead of seeing this as a commitment of a man of integrity seeking to honor his wife, it was viewed as some kind of nod to an oppressive patriarchal past,\u201d Waller says. Critics\u00a0said\u202fPence\u2019s statement was a false virtue that perpetuated sexism by\u00a0limiting\u202fwomen\u2019s career mobility and reducing women to instruments of sexual temptation. Ask people why standards of political virtue have changed, and you\u2019ll get different answers. Some say it happened during the 1960s, when the US government lied to the American public about the Vietnam War. Others say it happened in the \u201870s with President Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal, which played a crucial role in Carter\u2019s election. Nixon engaged in multiple abuses of office that involved wiretapping political opponents\u2019 phones, stealing documents and hatching a plan to instruct the CIA to impede an FBI\u2019s investigation. He later flat-out lied in an attempt to cover up his crimes. \u201cIt was a black eye in American history, a major erosion in trust in government,\u201d says\u00a0Andrew P. Hogue,\u00a0an associate dean at Baylor University and the author of \u201cStumping God: Reagan, Carter,\u00a0and the Invention of a Political Faith.\u201d \u201cThe very foundation of a successful democracy is that we have to be able to trust that the people we elect are doing what we hope they will do.\u201d Still others say American standards of political virtue eroded in the \u201890s, when President Bill Clinton had an affair with a White House intern \u2014 or again in 2016 with Trump\u2019s election. Some say it\u2019s happening now with widespread\u202fdenial\u202fabout the January 6 insurrection. The result is that we routinely get politicians acting in ways they never would have before, Waller says. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying \u2014 you get the politicians you deserve,\u201d he says. But political virtue is more than just a politician\u2019s private behavior. A politician can have a pristine personal life but lack political virtue if he or she does something that jeopardizes the welfare and stability of their country. The ancient Romans believed virtuous political leaders are willing to abandon self-interest in favor of the common good, says\u202fSarah Purcell, a political historian at Grinnell College in Iowa. The nation\u2019s first president, George Washington, was such a leader, she says. He could have declared himself king after the end of the Revolutionary War, but declined to run for a third term, allowing democracy to take root, Purcell says. \u201cHe [Washington] was a great military leader,\u201d adds Purcell, author of \u201cSpectacle of Grief.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s also the fact that he was willing to voluntarily give up military and political power that also strengthened his virtue.\u201d Why virtue in today\u2019s politics may be overrated Here\u2019s an uncomfortable truth: Some of our greatest and most influential presidents didn\u2019t demonstrate virtue in their private and political lives. Washington may have displayed political virtue, but he lacked personal virtue in one vital respect: He\u202fenslaved\u202fother human beings. John F. Kennedy was said to have had multiple extramarital affairs. Franklin D. Roosevelt\u00a0had a longtime\u00a0mistress. Bill Clinton was impeached after he had an affair in the Oval Office and then lied about it to cover it up. He left office with a booming economy and high approval ratings. Some would argue that a lack of virtue can make political leaders more effective. Take Lyndon Johnson,\u202fone of the most\u202finfluential\u202fpresidents in US history. He helped end Jim Crow segregation by championing the passage of \u202fthree monumental\u202fcivil rights bills. He\u2019s often hailed as a \u201cmaster of the Senate,\u201d\u202fsomeone who knew how to get laws passed. He also developed a reputation as a dirty political operator who allegedly\u202fstole\u202fhis\u202felection\u202fto the US Senate, bullied his staff and was\u202fruthless\u202fin his pursuit of power. \u201cHe would talk sympathetically to civil rights supporters, and\u00a0tell a Southern senator\u201d to get ready to take up that \u2018n**** bill,\u00a0Anthony Lewis wrote in a New York Times\u202fessay\u202fon Johnson. Critics say a contemporary master of the Senate, former Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, is also known for his \u201cwillingness to put the pursuit of power before principle.\u201d The Kentucky Republican was instrumental in shaping the conservative majority on the current Supreme Court, which has delivered one policy win after another for the GOP. McConnell denied Merrick Garland, then-President Obama\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, a Senate confirmation hearing in the spring of 2016 because he said it was too close to the presidential election. But when liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died less than two months before the 2020 election, McConnell discovered an exception to his own rule to seat Trump\u2019s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. So what was different in earlier eras?\u00a0It was the concept of shame, scholars say. Political leaders back then at least tried to shield their lack of virtue from the public, says\u202fRyan Barilleaux, a political scientist at Miami University in Ohio. \u201cThere used to be this attitude among Americans that presidents were to be held to a standard and that presidents and presidential candidates certainly tried to publicly live up to that standard, even if in private life they didn\u2019t,\u201d Barilleaux says. Trump is a prime example of how those expectations have changed. The former president has a\u202flong record\u202fof lying in public, making\u202fracist statements\u202fand\u202fboasting\u202fabout sexually assaulting women. He also has been accused of inciting an insurrection to overturn a presidential election he lost. And he yet he remains an overwhelmingly popular figure in the GOP. So why do Americans today support politicians with questionable virtue? Barilleaux says it\u2019s because more voters now care more about partisan victories than virtue. They rationalize their support of unscrupulous political leaders by heeding the catchphrase Netflix once used to promote the main character in its \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d series. It describes Frank Underwood, the show\u2019s slippery political operator, as,\u202f\u201cBad, for the greater good.\u201d Why virtue is still vital in American politics One can also make the\u202fMachiavellian\u202fargument that virtue can weaken a political leader\u2019s ability to get things done. Carter had problems beyond his control that\u202fdoomed\u202fhis presidency: The Iran hostage crisis, runaway inflation, and an economy headed toward a recession. He almost sounded relieved when he left the presidency. He once quipped after leaving office, \u201cIt is very nice now when people wave at me \u2014 they use all their fingers.\u201d Carter\u2019s moral inflexibility\u202f\u00a0became a political liability,\u00a0some say. One Carter biographer\u202fsaid,\u202f\u201cRighteousness was both the key to his success and his greatest weakness.\u201d The late Walter Mondale, who served as Carter\u2019s vice president,\u202frecalled\u202fthis trait once during an interview. \u201cMany times the one argument that I would find would ruin a person\u2019s case is when he\u2019d say, \u2018This is good for you politically,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Mondale said.\u202f\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to hear that. He didn\u2019t want to think that way and he didn\u2019t want his staff to think that way. He wanted to know what\u2019s right.\u201d A lack of political virtue can boost leaders in the short term, but over time it can drag them down.\u202fJohnson\u2019s win-at-all cost mentality helped him score landmark political victories, but it also destroyed his presidency. He couldn\u2019t tell the American people\u202fthe truth\u202fabout the cost and futility of fighting the Vietnam War. He lost his chance at presidential greatness. Johnson didn\u2019t run again for a second term because he had lost credibility with the American people. Virtue is the connective tissue that holds a democracy together. When leaders and citizens abandon it, democracy\u202fcrumbles. The founding fathers thought that democracy was impossible without having virtuous citizens. \u201cOnly a virtuous people are capable of freedom,\u201d Benjamin Franklin once\u202fsaid. \u201cAs nations become more corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\u201d A lack of virtue is also bad for business, the author\u202fArthur C. Brooks\u202fwrote in a recent essay. He pointed to a famous 1958 study\u202fthat compared a small town in Italy that was filled with dishonesty and incivility with a comparable town of the same size in the US. Poverty and corruption were widespread in the Italian town. But the American town, which had \u201chigh social trust, a culture of honesty, and openness across political differences,\u201d prospered economically and politically, Brooks wrote. \u201cTo establish trust is hard; wrecking it is simpler, and we seem to be doing that in the United States,\u201d Brooks wrote. A lack of virtue in government can even erode patriotism. People are less willing to serve or die for a county they believe is led by politically corrupt leaders. A recent\u202fpoll\u202ffound that a majority of young voters in the US believe that \u201cnearly all politicians are corrupt, and make money from their political power.\u201d Only 7% disagreed. The lead pollster said today\u2019s young voters see the US as \u201ca dying empire led by bad people.\u201d The haunting question Carter may leave behind Carter\u2019s exemplary life offers proof that political virtue can pay off in the long run. More historians are saying now his presidency looks better in retrospect. Carter brought true diversity to the executive branch and judiciary, brokered a Middle East peace deal, doubled the size of the national park system and was the first head of state \u00a0address global warming, the author Jonathan Alter wrote in a recent\u202fessay. Carter also established a global standard for how governments should treat its people through his human rights campaign. \u201cCarter spent only 12 of his 98 years in public office (four in the Georgia state senate, four as governor, four as president),\u201d Alter wrote. \u201cAnd yet, for all his shortcomings, he left a legacy of service, decency, intelligence, and integrity that contrasts sharply with many politicians of our own time. Let\u2019s hope we see his likes again.\u201d But that won\u2019t happen if Americans don\u2019t demand virtuous political leaders. \u201cThe standards of civility, kindness, empathy, and tolerance that Carter set for himself never really caught on in American politics,\u201d says\u202fKerriann Stout,\u202fa history professor who also teaches constitutional law at Pace University in New York. \u201cCarter\u2019s politics may have been what this country needed,\u201d she says, but \u201ctime has demonstrated it is not what it wanted.\u201d As we prepare to say goodbye to Carter, we may also be bidding farewell to a bygone era: When more Americans cared how politicians carried themselves in private and in public. Carter\u2019s waning days remind us of not only what he stood for, but what we\u2019ve lost.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-hunter-biden-gun-violence-speech", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday heralded the steps his administration has taken to strengthen the country\u2019s gun laws and enhance the penalties for those who violate them, in what was an awkward political moment for a man whose son had been convicted just hours earlier on federal gun charges. Speaking at an Everytown for Gun Safety event under a banner that read \u201cGun Sense University\u201d in large block letters, the president did not reference his son\u2019s conviction. Hunter Biden was pronounced guilty earlier in the day of three felony charges after a jury found he lied on a form by saying he was not abusing drugs when he purchased a firearm in 2018. Instead,\u00a0speaking as someone who has had two children die prematurely,\u00a0he spent much of his remarks reflecting on personal loss\u00a0and saying\u00a0that he empathized with those in the audience who have lost loved ones to gun violence. \u201cNever give up on hope,\u201d the president told the audience. While Biden did not reference his son\u2019s conviction on stage Tuesday afternoon, it was sure to be at the top of his mind. Biden is known to be passionately defensive of his family and sensitive to outside criticism of his son\u2019s troubled history. The president rearranged his schedule to leave directly from the gun-safety event for Wilmington, where his son remains after the jury there convicted him. The White House cancelled a previously scheduled press briefing that was to take place Tuesday afternoon. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timing of Biden\u2019s address and his son\u2019s federal trial Tuesday morning. While Biden has largely avoided commenting on his son\u2019s trial - he said in an interview last week that he would respect the trial\u2019s outcome and would not pardon his son - the outcome of the jury\u2019s verdict is sure to be at the top of his mind on Tuesday. The president is known to be passionately defensive of his family and sensitive to outside criticism of his son\u2019s troubled history. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d Biden said in a statement following the verdict. \u201cSo many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The painful moment for the Biden family comes a day before\u00a0President Biden is expected to leave for a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The fluke of scheduling speaks to the balance Biden has been forced to strike throughout his son\u2019s legal proceedings. As the trial was underway last week, Biden was in France commemorating D-Day. Aides said the president was keeping track of the trial from overseas, and remained in touch with his son and first lady Dr. Jill Biden, who had returned to Delaware to attend the trial for one day. Before and after that trip, Biden spent a sizable amount of time with Hunter in Delaware. He returned from France directly to the family home in Wilmington. He\u2019ll attempt to put the personal drama on the back-burner while he talks about gun violence, a topic that he views as key to his political life. As a senator, the president helped get an assault weapons ban passed through Congress in the 1990s and has promised to do so again. He also frequently touts signing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was the first significant gun safety legislation in a quarter-century when it was passed. That act, which was signed into law by Biden almost two years ago, was created in the wake of massacres at a Texas elementary school and a New York supermarket. It established new criminal offenses for the straw-purchasing of firearms by buyers who lie about the gun\u2019s intended owner, among other provisions. \u201cIt\u2019s the most significant gun legislation in nearly 30 years, and we passed it only because you got out and worked like hell to get it done,\u201d Biden said Tuesday. \u201cI may have had the idea, but you got it made, you made it happen. It was designed to reduce gun violence and save lives, and I\u2019m so proud of the tremendous progress we\u2019ve made since then.\u201d Absent from Biden\u2019s comments Tuesday, however, was an announcement that the Department of Justice had brought more than 500 new gun charges using statutes under the bipartisan gun law. The White House had previewed the announcement to reporters ahead of the speech, but Biden instead opted to more broadly focus on it. The White House declined to comment on why the reference to the volume of prosecutions did not appear in the speech, pointing to the overarching message in the address. \u201cThe President highlighted the progress his Administration has made reducing crime and getting illegal guns off our streets,\u201d a White House spokesperson told CNN. Biden has pushed for universal background checks of gun purchases, increased red-flag laws that allow law enforcement to confiscate guns from those deemed a threat to safety, and a ban on assault weapons. He has said he would make those efforts a priority if he were to attain a second term. But most of those policies would include congressional cooperation, and gun control remains one of the most divisive and intractable topics in American politics. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has promised to roll back any gun-control advancements made during Biden\u2019s term. Addressing the NRA convention in May, Trump said the rights of gun owners were \u201cunder siege\u201d and urged them to vote in November. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_nevada-senate-election-rosen-brown", "text": "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Republican challenger Sam Brown\u00a0will\u00a0face off in one of the most important Senate races of the 2024 election, with both winning their primaries Tuesday. Senate Democrats are facing a difficult political landscape this fall, having to defend seats in the red states of Montana, Ohio and West Virginia as well as in several other swing states. So Rosen\u2019s seat is\u00a0crucial to the party\u2019s hopes of holding on to its slim majority in the chamber. Nevada is poised to play a key role in November\u2019s elections, as Republicans aim to reverse years of Democratic dominance in federal races there. The last time the GOP won a Senate race in Nevada was 2012, and the party\u2019s last presidential nominee to carry the state was George W. Bush in 2004. But Republicans flipped the governor\u2019s office in 2022 and hope to build on those gains this year. Brown, a retired Army captain who earned a Purple Heart when he was wounded by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for the state\u2019s other Senate seat in 2022. But national Republicans identified him as a top recruit this cycle, and he received a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump over the weekend. In Tuesday\u2019s primary, Brown defeated a field that included Jeff Gunter, a wealthy dermatologist who was Trump\u2019s ambassador to Iceland and spent $2.2 million of his own money on\u00a0ads\u00a0casting himself as\u00a0the former president\u2019s\u00a0real ally in the race and portraying Brown as beholden to Washington interests. Brown\u00a0ran\u00a0about $840,000 worth of advertising ahead of the primary, but he\u2019s also been supported by several outside groups that poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the primary, including: Duty First Nevada PAC, which spent more than $900,000; the Republican Leadership Fund, which spent nearly $470,000; and Americans for Prosperity, the influential conservative organization funded by the Koch family, which spent about $420,000 on the race. Brown\u2019s ads have focused on his support for Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly curbing illegal immigration. They also regularly highlight his decorated military service. \u201cAs a veteran, I\u2019ll never compromise America\u2019s security. I\u2019ll finish Trump\u2019s wall and stop the invasion of the border. As a small-business owner, I\u2019ll lower prices and make Trump\u2019s tax cuts permanent,\u201d Brown says in one ad. Rosen\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has already aired $7.5 million in TV ads. She had\u00a0$10.2 million in her campaign coffers as of May 22 compared with $2.5 million for Brown. Rosen\u2019s ads have sought to portray the senator as a moderate, invoking her support for measures that would lower prescription drug prices and give health care benefits to veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. They also cast Rosen as breaking with Democratic leadership on border security. \u201cSix years ago, I promised to do what\u2019s right for Nevada, not my party leaders. I won\u2019t walk the party line and I never have. I\u2019m proud to be named one of the most bipartisan senators,\u201d Rosen says in one ad. Rosen was first elected to the Senate in 2018, unseating Republican incumbent Dean Heller. She previously served a single term in the House representing a Las Vegas-area swing seat.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/nevada-senate-election-rosen-brown/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_aclu-bidens-border-executive-action", "text": "The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Biden administration Wednesday over a sweeping executive action that largely shuts off asylum to migrants crossing the US southern border illegally. The executive action \u2013 which bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum, with some limited exceptions, when an average daily threshold is met \u2013 marked President Joe Biden\u2019s most dramatic move on the US-Mexico border. Moments after the measure was announced last week, the ACLU warned it would sue the administration. On Wednesday, the group filed the lawsuit in Washington, DC. The filing argues that the new rules violate US immigration law and the Administrative Procedure Act, which lays out the procedural steps agencies must go through in implementing certain policies. The lawsuit challenges rules restricting asylum for migrants crossing illegally, citing US law that states migrants can apply \u201cwhether or not\u201d they enter at a designated port of entry; the requirement to claim fear, instead of being asked by authorities; the heightened screening standard; and reducing time for attorney consultation. The complaint doesn\u2019t seek emergency relief at this point. The plaintiffs are two Texas-based organizations that work with immigrants: Las Americas and RAICES. \u201cThere is no legal daylight between this asylum ban and the Trump ban the courts struck down.\u00a0The law is flatly illegal, period,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney who is lead counsel in the lawsuit and argued the challenge to the Trump asylum ban. \u201cThis law will not deter desperate families from seeking refuge here. It is ill advised and will put lives at risk,\u201d he added. White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez in a statement responding to the lawsuit said the Biden administration \u201ctook these actions, within its authorities, because border encounters remain too high and after Congressional Republicans twice voted against a historic bipartisan border security agreement that would have provided critical resources, statutory changes, and additional personnel to the border.\u201d Senior administration officials anticipated, when previewing the executive action last week, that there\u2019d be legal challenges. \u201cI respectfully disagree with the ACLU,\u201d\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro\u00a0Mayorkas\u00a0told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz Sunday. \u201cI anticipate they will sue us. We stand by the legality of what we have done.\u201d Similar rules implemented under the Trump administration have been blocked by the courts. In 2018, Trump tried to use the same authority invoked by Biden \u2013 212f, which gives the president broad authority to implement immigration restrictions \u2013 to clamp down on border crossings. But ultimately, a federal appeals court ruled\u00a0that the authority conflicts with asylum law and the 212f authority doesn\u2019t override it. The case \u2013 known as East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump \u2013 served as an example of why the president is limited in his ability to shut down the border.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Jim Risch\u2019s frustration\u00a0with the inability\u00a0to reach a deal, especially after a similar bill passed the House last week that had the support of 42 Democrats. \u201cThere were numerous phone calls between a bipartisan group of senators who were galvanized to work on legislation regarding doing something on the ICC, but over the course of the last three weeks that motivation seems to have gone away,\u201d according\u00a0to source familiar\u00a0with the dynamics.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters", "text": "Theodore Roosevelt carefully crafted his image of rugged manliness. The wealthy heir became a Badlands cowboy and a volunteer Rough Rider and war hero. A populist and a reformer as president, Roosevelt enjoyed incredible popularity during his lifetime \u2013 and he nearly remade the American political system when, frustrated by the direction of the Republican Party after his presidency, he splintered off as a third-party candidate and nearly won election as a Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d in 1912. But that image is not complete, according to \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President,\u201d a new biography by Edward O\u2019Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, which is constructing a new Roosevelt library in the Badlands of North Dakota. O\u2019Keefe is also a former colleague at CNN. The book argues that the women in Roosevelt\u2019s life do not get the historical attention they deserve, something O\u2019Keefe proves with detailed research and engaging writing. I talked to O\u2019Keefe about the book and how Roosevelt and his definition of masculinity relate to today. Our conversation by phone, edited for length, is below: Notoriously masculine, but the product of unsung women WOLF: Your book is about the women behind the most notoriously masculine president. What were you trying to do here?  O\u2019KEEFE: \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d argues that the most masculine president in the American memory is actually the product of unsung and extraordinary women. Theodore Roosevelt is chiseled in marble on Mount Rushmore, and the myth is that everything he did in his incredibly successful personal and political life was the product of his own will. That is true, but it also isn\u2019t the full story. His two sisters, Bamie (Anna) and Conie (Corinne); his two wives, Alice and Edith; and his mother Mittie (Martha) were an integral part of his success, and their stories have been almost entirely lost to history. Frequently absent at times of emotional difficulty WOLF: That theme shines through \u2014 that these women propped up this most famous of American men. But much of his life is built around leaving them. He was not there when his first wife gave birth. He left his second wife, who was critically ill, to go off with the Rough Riders. He\u2019s on safari. He\u2019s in the Badlands. He\u2019s very absent. How do you reconcile that fact with the larger theme of the book? O\u2019KEEFE: I\u2019m so glad you noticed that. I had this fascinating conversation with Connie Roosevelt, who is the wife of Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy\u2019s great-grandson). The first time I met her in 2019, we were at a fundraiser for the National Parks Conservation Association, and I had just started to work on the research for what would become \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d And I said to Connie almost exactly as you\u2019re saying, that there is this pattern that Theodore Roosevelt is absent. He leaves in a lot of emotionally difficult circumstances. And she chuckled and said, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go hunting,\u201d which is a line that I do use in the book. Theodore Roosevelt, who is known for willing himself through physical pain \u2014 that resilience of a cowboy and a rancher would really wilt when it came to emotionally difficult circumstances. He basically abandoned his daughter for the better part of three years, offered to give his daughter to his sister and have Bamie, his elder sister, raise her. He later said of his exploits in Cuba that he would have left his wife\u2019s deathbed to be there, and that\u2019s not an exaggerated statement. I think that the women in his life understood that they needed to be the support system, especially emotionally, that he didn\u2019t always have the capacity to have. I think if there\u2019s one surprising thing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d in addition to the argument that TR is actually the product of women, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an incredibly emotional person, as much as he\u2019s caricatured in history. I love Robin Williams and the depiction in \u201cNight at the Museum,\u201d but that\u2019s a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt. It\u2019s easy to caricature him with the big smile and teeth and the hat and the cowboy, but he\u2019s a very sensitive, emotional person who feels very deeply. I think it\u2019s what allowed him to empathize with people. It\u2019s what allowed him to connect with people. That\u2019s all, by the way, a direct result of the influence of his mother, Mittie, who\u2019s been completely written off in history. How a wealthy person became a populist leader WOLF: The gender inequality of the day is a major takeaway from this book. But also the general inequality. Roosevelt was born into fabulous wealth. These are people that take monthslong trips to Europe when he\u2019s a child. He is never not wealthy. But then he escapes that perception to become this populist leader. When inequality is such a big issue today, how do you view his rise from that perspective? O\u2019KEEFE: Theodore Roosevelt is not a Horatio Alger story. He does not rise from humble beginnings to find his way to the upper echelons of power and wealth in America. Interestingly, the expectation in the Victorian and Gilded Age was that those with the greatest amount in society owed very little back to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, like his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, was considered a traitor to his class. It was very unusual for someone of his status and wealth to run for office. Politics was seen as a dirty business, something that the middle and lower classes, that the immigrant class would be interested in, because why would you need the power of the vote? You have wealth. You have influence. I think some of that is due to the influence of his parents, Mittie and Thee (Theodore Sr.), a Southerner and a Northerner, who were able to disagree without being disagreeable over one of the most contentious issues in American memory, the Civil War. He saw them come together as a family and be interested in the unity of their family as well as the country. He did have a noblesse oblige. He did feel that to whom much is given, much is required. And I think that experience out in the Badlands of North Dakota \u2014 where it didn\u2019t matter if you were wealthy; you were expected to work equally with the person alongside you. A horse in a roundup doesn\u2019t much care if you\u2019re from the East Side of Manhattan \u2014 you\u2019re either gonna survive and do the work or you\u2019re not gonna make it. Connecting Roosevelt to Biden WOLF: The most gripping part of the book is your description of the circumstances around his first wife dying in childbirth and his mother dying in the same house on the same day. I was trying to quantify that level of tragedy, and the first thing that popped to my mind was the current president, Joe Biden, who lost his wife and his daughter just after he was first elected to the Senate. I wonder if you also made that connection. O\u2019KEEFE: Absolutely. Loss which no one ever hopes to experience is often the crucible of an individual\u2019s life. In Theodore\u2019s circumstance, it was his mother, Mittie, after his father\u2019s death, that said, we need to live for the living, not for the dead \u2014 that you would dishonor the memory of those who are gone if you did not live a life of purpose. I think that\u2019s very similar to President Biden\u2019s circumstances, absolutely. You know, he took the seat in the Senate that then, of course, he held for 36 years, in part because it would be a dishonor to the memory of his wife and daughter if he didn\u2019t. Loss and happenstance, fate and serendipity play such an incredible role in American history. You have to look at these moments, these crucible moments, as the turning points of not just these individual political lives but how they intertwine with the fate of the nation. A new focus on 21st-century masculinity WOLF: There\u2019s been a rise recently, particularly on the American political right, of men trying to reassert masculinity. Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who wrote a book about Roosevelt, more recently has a book called \u201cManhood,\u201d for instance. What do you think Roosevelt would make of that trend? O\u2019KEEFE: It\u2019s exactly what he was experiencing at his time. When Roosevelt was born in 1858, there\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no airplanes, there\u2019s no submarines. He will be the first president to go up on an airplane, to ride a car, to travel abroad while president, to go in a submarine. Everything changes, right? The society is shifting from agrarian to industrial. The technology that is coming in this age is disrupting how people feel about their sense of self and connection and community. There\u2019s an immigration wave in the country that, in the view of many, is changing what the definition of what an American is, and there\u2019s a fierce debate about whether we\u2019re an isolationist country, or we\u2019re going to be a global power. Does any of this sound familiar? This all intersects with masculinity and gender roles, right? There are constant themes of masculinity. How to be a man. What does it mean to be a man. What do you have to physically do in order to show that you\u2019re a man. He\u2019ll project the quintessential ideal of manhood in society\u2019s expectations at the turn of the 20th century. But what I\u2019m showing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d is that he too had this incredible emotional, soft side \u2014 that it was women, who were constrained by the age, working with him to achieve his goals. To your question about what is happening now, people trying to understand gender roles, masculinity, manhood \u2014 instead of looking at it as a continuum, trying to sort of define it as one or the other, to me, it sounds very much like something I\u2019ve heard before, if you pay attention to history. The duality of Roosevelt in the killing of a dog WOLF: There\u2019s a moment in the book when Roosevelt has just had a falling-out with Edith, his childhood sweetheart, who would later become his second wife. He\u2019s riding his horse home and, in a moment of pique, shoots a neighbor\u2019s dog. As I was reading that passage, I immediately thought of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced serious backlash for writing in her memoir about shooting a family dog who was unruly. Obviously, the 19th century was a different time, but I wondered if you thought of Roosevelt when you read about Noem, a Dakota lawmaker. Is she not just living \u201cthe strenuous life?\u201d O\u2019KEEFE: There\u2019s a stark difference between a family pet, as described by the governor of South Dakota, and an animal running in the Oyster Bay woods (in New York) that was owned by a neighbor. But this is the duality of Theodore Roosevelt. If you go out to Sagamore Hill (Roosevelt\u2019s home), to this day, one of the most touching parts is the pet cemetery, where they\u2019ve got the graves of all the different, many beloved animals that they had. The Roosevelts had a menagerie, a veritable zoo at the White House \u2014 Josiah the badger and Emily Spinach, the snake whom Alice (his daughter, who was named for her mother) named because she didn\u2019t like her aunt, Emily, and she didn\u2019t like spinach, so her snake must be Emily Spinach; Algonquin, the pony who was taken up to the second floor of the White House. They had so many dogs in their home, both in Sagamore and in the White House, that the pet cemetery is filled with the names of these beloved family pets. So it\u2019s incongruous with Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s attitude about pets and animals, but yes, it is true that after he broke up with Edith, he was so angry that he did indeed shoot a dog on a horseback ride through the woods around Oyster Bay. An unusual parallel, perhaps, to today\u2019s stories.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_us-intelligence-sinwar-gaza", "text": "American intelligence officials believe that Yahya Sinwar, the powerful leader of Hamas in Gaza who is thought to be the group\u2019s key decision-maker on any potential ceasefire deal, likely believes the group can survive Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy it and feels confident it is well-positioned to approach negotiations from a place of strength, according to US officials familiar with recent assessments. The goal for Hamas is to survive, these sources say \u2014\u00a0that would be victory for\u00a0the group. Sinwar likely believes\u00a0Hamas\u00a0can hold out while Israel\u2019s global standing deteriorates as the war in Gaza, which\u00a0has killed thousands of civilians,\u00a0continues. A senior Biden administration official put it bluntly: \u201cHe believes he\u2019s winning. For US negotiators pursuing a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, it\u2019s a discouraging assessment. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the families of American hostages being held in Gaza in a meeting in Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning that the fate of the latest proposal rests with Sinwar. While the US is pressuring those who have sway over Hamas to push the group to accept the deal, Blinken on Tuesday made it clear that the US believes that Sinwar is the ultimate decision-maker. \u201cI think there are those who have influenced, but influence is one thing, actually getting a decision made is the is another thing. I don\u2019t think anyone other than the Hamas leadership in Gaza are actually the ones who can make decisions,\u201d Blinken said, adding: \u201cThat is what we are waiting on.\u201d If Sinwar believes the group can\u00a0hold out against the Israeli invasion, it would mean he doesn\u2019t yet feel sufficient pressure to reach\u00a0an\u00a0agreement that would end the fighting \u2014\u00a0even as Palestinian civilians continue to perish. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Sinwar called their deaths \u201cnecessary sacrifices\u201d in messages reviewed by the paper. \u201cWe have the Israelis right where we want them,\u201d\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0told Hamas\u2019 political leadership in the Gulf state of Qatar recently, according to one of the messages. The date of the message isn\u2019t clear but suggests that\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0is pressing for the conflict to continue. US officials have sought publicly to portray Sinwar as callous to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and interested only in preserving his own personal survival. \u201cIt should come as a shock to no one that Mr. Sinwar cares nothing at all about the lives of innocent Palestinians that have been caught up in this war, a war he started.And it should surprise and shock no one that a beast like Mr. Sinwar would actually take glee in it and see advantage in it,\u201d White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told\u00a0reporters on Tuesday. Sinwar, who was one of the key planners of the October 7 attack, has remained at large in the vast warren of tunnels trenched beneath Gaza, moving frequently and possibly surrounded by hostages as human shields, officials believe. The US intelligence community has struggled to track him, according to one source familiar with the intelligence. But he has continued to drive Hamas\u2019 negotiation positions, and it can often take days for messages to reach him, slowing the process. Both Sinwar and Hamas\u2019 top military official, Mohammed Deif, are still alive. Even\u00a0if Israel has killed 15,000 Hamas militants, as\u00a0it claims, it means that as much as half of the group\u2019s estimated fighting force is still on the battlefield. A longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas\u2019 military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group\u2019s civilian and political leader. He was elected to\u00a0Hamas\u2019 main\u00a0decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017\u00a0as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza. However,\u00a0he has since\u00a0become\u00a0the Politburo\u2019s de facto leader, according to\u00a0research by the European Council on Foreign Relations. Regional polling \u2014\u00a0while flawed \u2014\u00a0has indicated that Hamas had grown unpopular in Gaza before the October 7 attack, and some analysts have suggested that the group may have launched the operation in part to try to gin up some domestic support. Blinken said Hamas\u2019 answer to the proposal will reveal the group\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe await the answer from Hamas and that will speak volumes about what they want, what they\u2019re looking for, who they\u2019re looking after,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAre they looking after one guy who may be for now safe \u2026 while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what\u2019s necessary to actually move this to a better place, to help end the suffering of people to help bring real security to Israelis and Palestinians alike?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/us-intelligence-sinwar-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_us-russia-sanction-g7-summit", "text": "President Joe Biden will arrive at the G7 summit in Italy with over 300 new sanctions aimed at further isolating and financially weakening Russia. The measures are \u201cguided by G7 commitments to intensify the pressure on Russia,\u201d according to the US Department of Treasury, and they mark the latest move to limit the Kremlin\u2019s revenues and hamper Moscow\u2019s ability to source materials for its war in Ukraine. The sanctions take aim at foreign financial institutions supporting Russia\u2019s war, restrict Russia\u2019s access to certain US software and information technology services, and target over 300 individuals and entities \u201cwhose products and services enable Russia to sustain\u00a0its war effort and evade sanction,\u201d the department said. The US and its western allies have\u00a0levied a series of sanctions\u00a0against Russia in recent years, but the country has adapted to them. Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken to gloating about Russia\u2019s resistance to international sanctions, which take time to have an effect. \u201cToday\u2019s actions strike at their remaining avenues for international materials and equipment, including their reliance on critical supplies from third countries. We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia\u2019s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia\u2019s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Among the actions is a step that will authorize Treasury to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions aiding Russia\u2019s military-industrial base. The move threatens sanctions on any financial institution that does business with any previously-sanctioned individual or entity, including Sberbank and VTB bank. \u201cRussia today has become a war economy, and while Russia is working to build the weapons, from tanks to missiles to aircrafts that they need, fundamentally, they can\u2019t build them alone \u2013 they need parts and goods from other countries and from companies and individuals that are not in Russia,\u201d a senior Treasury official said Wednesday. \u201cAnd today\u2019s actions of expanding our secondary sanctions regime will make it harder and more difficult for Russia to get access to those goods that they need from third countries, and from individuals and companies in those countries.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s tranche will also expand existing sanctions on the sale of semiconductors to Russia, broadening economic penalties to target countries using US technologies to produce the much-needed computer chips. In particular, the measure will take aim at China, which has managed to fill a significant portion of Russia\u2019s industrial base, circumventing sanctions already in place. \u201cWhat we are doing today is going after those goods that are that are not just US-origin, but US-branded, which means all goods that are produced using US technology, tools, software, intellectual property \u2013 and going after entities in these third countries, preventing them from getting access to any of these goods \u2026 to sell any of these goods into Russia,\u201d a senior Commerce Department official told reporters Wednesday, estimating that the sanctions deployed Wednesday could impact nearly $100 million in high-priority items, including semiconductors. Another move will target Russia\u2019s attempts to evade sanctions through networks that use \u201cconvoluted schemes to move money and other valuable goods and assets,\u201d Treasury said. It will designate more than 90 individuals and entities doing so in Russia, Belarus, the British Virgin Islands, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, China, Serbia, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/us-russia-sanction-g7-summit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial-verdict", "text": "A federal jury has convicted Hunter Biden on all three federal felony gun charges he faced, concluding that he violated laws meant to prevent drug addicts from owning firearms. The conviction marks the first time a president\u2019s immediate family member has been found guilty of a crime during their father\u2019s term in office, though his crimes predate Joe Biden\u2019s tenure as president. The jury, which deliberated for just under three hours, returned guilty verdicts on\u00a0all three charges, which stemmed from a revolver\u00a0Hunter Biden bought in October 2018 at a Delaware gun shop. The first two counts were for lying about his drug use on a federal background check form, and the third count was for possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000 at sentencing, though he likely will receive far less than the maximum as a first-time offender. Before dismissing the parties, the judge told them sentencing is usually set for 120 days following a verdict, which means it is likely to happen before Election Day. Special counsel David Weiss told reporters that the conviction was about the \u201cillegal choices the defendant made while in the throes of addiction,\u201d as he stressed that \u201cno one in this country is above the law.\u201d In a statement, Hunter Biden said he was \u201cdisappointed by the outcome\u201d but heartened by support from his family. \u201cI am more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from Melissa, my family, my friends, and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome,\u201d Hunter Biden said.\u00a0\u201cRecovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time.\u201d In a statement, President Biden said he will \u201caccept the outcome of this case\u201d and pledged support for his son. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad,\u201d the president said. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d Concludes painful chapter for Biden family The outcome ends a painful chapter for the Biden family, including many members who were directly involved in the courtroom drama. Hunter Biden was in the defendant\u2019s seat; many members of the family, including first lady Jill Biden, were often in the courtroom showing support, and a few were called to testify. The first lady arrived at the courthouse shortly after the verdict was read. She stared immediately ahead and did not move her gaze away. After court ended, Hunter Biden turned to his legal team and flashed a brief smile, perhaps stunned by the outcome, before hugging all of his attorneys and patting them on the back. As he exited, Hunter Biden gave kisses and hugs to family members and friends in the courtroom, almost like a receiving line. His friend and financial backer Kevin Morris walked out with his arms crossed. Some of the supporters looked stunned. Valerie Biden, President Biden\u2019s sister, entered the courtroom a few minutes after the verdict was read. Leaving the courthouse after the verdict, Hunter Biden shuffled his family members into an elevator as he held hands with his wife. He smiled briefly and left. The trial has unfolded against the backdrop of President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump, who himself was convicted of a felony last month in his New York hush money trial. Reacting to Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction on Tuesday, the Trump campaign initially wished him \u201cwell in his recovery and legal affairs\u201d before striking that sentiment in a later version of a statement. It also called the proceedings a \u201cdistraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family,\u201d falsely claiming that the president raked in \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in overseas dealings, though there is no evidence Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son\u2019s business dealings abroad. President has ruled out pardon Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction comes after a long-running Justice Department investigation that began in 2018, and it raises the stakes for his second scheduled trial, slated to begin in September,\u00a0on federal tax offenses. Both cases have been overseen by Weiss, who was previously the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. The guilty verdicts in the gun case are a major vindication for Weiss\u2019 team of prosecutors, who have vehemently denied allegations from Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers that the cases are politically motivated. The historic trial almost never happened. Both sides went before the judge last July with a\u00a0negotiated agreement\u00a0to resolve the gun case and have Hunter Biden plead guilty to two separate tax misdemeanors. But the judge, Maryellen Noreika,\u00a0refused to approve\u00a0the deal after a whirlwind plea hearing in which the finer points of the arrangement\u00a0crumbled under scrutiny. President Biden and the White House have repeatedly ruled out a pardon for his son. The weeklong gun trial featured intensely personal and gut-wrenching testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s well-known struggles with alcoholism and crack cocaine addiction. It shed a national spotlight on a period that Hunter Biden described in his book as \u201ca blur of complete and utter debauchery\u201d during which he did \u201cnothing but drinking and drugging.\u201d Prosecutors leaned on the testimony of three of Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-partners \u2013 including their star witness, Hallie Biden, widow of his brother, Beau Biden \u2013 to tell the jury in excruciating detail how his dependency on crack cocaine led to the end of his marriage, strained his relationships with his kids, and put him in danger on several occasions. Hunter Biden\u2019s defense team argued, unsuccessfully, that he didn\u2019t view himself as a user or addict when he bought and possessed the gun. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell had implored the jury to acquit Hunter Biden on those grounds. This story has been updated with additional developments and reaction.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_nathan-wade-trump-interview-the-source-cnntv", "text": "Former special prosecutor Nathan Wade says he believes Donald Trump will \u201cabsolutely\u201d be put on trial in Georgia in the 2020 election subversion case \u2013 even if he wins a second term and he\u2019s in the White House at the time. Wade resigned from the case in March over allegations of an improper romantic relationship with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis but said in an exclusive interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Source\u201d that he remains close friends with her. The question of whether a sitting US president can be forced to stand trial for state-level criminal charges has never been litigated. Wade said in the interview Wednesday that he expects prosecutors and defense attorneys will have to confront that unprecedented scenario if Trump wins the 2024 election. When asked if Trump can be put on trial in the Peach State during a second term, Wade said: \u201cI do believe that he can.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that it \u2026 it looks good to the rest of the world. But certainly I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything that would prevent that from happening,\u201d Wade said. He added: \u201cIf he wins the election, then certainly there are lawyers out there who will be charged with figuring out that issue, maneuvering around it.\u201d Wade\u2019s interview comes as the Georgia Court of Appeals has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Trump and his co-defendants until a panel of judges decides if Willis should be removed from the case. Trump, who has been seeking to push off legal issues until at least 2025, has been arguing that her affair with Wade should also disqualify her. The court\u2019s recent order pausing the case is the latest indication that a trial will not occur before the November presidential election. The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, though it could issue a ruling sooner. Willis in a new filing on Wednesday asked the state appeals court to dismiss the appeal of trial Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s original order due to a \u201clack of sufficient evidence.\u201d \u201cWith the case now docketed,\u00a0the State of Georgia, by and through Atlanta Judicial Circuit District Attorney Fani T. Willis, moves for the appeal to be dismissed as\u00a0improvidently granted due to the lack of sufficient evidence, based upon\u00a0the explicit factual findings of the trial court, to support reversal of the\u00a0order at issue,\u201d the filing from the district attorney\u2019s office states. Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead defense counsel in Georgia, called Willis\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal a \u201clast ditch effort.\u201d On Wednesday, Wade pushed back on criticism that his relationship with Willis was to blame for delaying Trump\u2019s trial. \u201cI don\u2019t believe my actions played a role at all,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI believe in the indictment. Certainly I would never have done anything that would have jeopardized that work. I do think the timing of the personal relationship I had was bad.\u201d \u201cThis prosecution has nothing to do with the voters and their opinion as to whether or not this indictment is proper or not proper. It has everything to do with the rule of law,\u201d he added. Trial court Judge Scott McAfee had previously ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped away, prompting his resignation. The decision from the judge came after he held several days of witness testimony and evidence over claims from defense attorneys that Wade and Willis had engaged in an improper relationship, which they alleged financially benefited the district attorney. McAfee, in his ruling, noted that \u201cGeorgia law does not permit the finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices \u2013 even repeatedly.\u201d Yet, the judge wrote in his decision that an \u201codor of mendacity remains\u201d over the circumstances of their relationship and that either Willis or Wade would have to leave the case. Wade announced his resignation shortly after the ruling.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-investigation-what-matters", "text": "It was nearly a year ago that CNN first reported about a cover-up at the Coast Guard Academy. That initial report about how the academy kept secret its own review of decades of sexual assault cover-ups continues to reverberate. This week, the Coast Guard Academy official in charge of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, resigned in protest and said the Coast Guard had made her an unwitting accomplice to a cover-up. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable,\u201d Norenberg said in a statement. Watch her appearance on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d. Separately, the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is scheduled to testify about the scandal on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where she will face tough questioning about why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. How does investigative reporting like this come to be? It took a team of\u00a0journalists\u00a0from CNN Investigates,\u00a0including Melanie Hicken,\u00a0Blake Ellis, Audrey Ash, Curt Devine and Pamela Brown. I emailed with Hicken and Ellis, reporters who have been working on this story since the beginning. Our conversation is below. WOLF: You\u2019ve been covering this Coast Guard story for some time. What was the first thread you pulled on it, and how has it unraveled? HICKEN and ELLIS: Our Coast Guard reporting all started with a young woman named Hope Hicks who was a student at a different service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy. In an anonymous blog post, she wrote about how she had been raped by her boss while out at sea \u2013 prompting a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry. As we started digging into her case, we became fascinated by this little-known industry.\u00a0We\u00a0spent months talking to merchant mariners who were assaulted while working on commercial ships and learned more about how the justice process works in the commercial shipping world \u2013\u00a0ultimately discovering that a number of sexual assaults were going unpunished and that it was all happening under the Coast Guard\u2019s watch.\u00a0So, that was the turning point where we started turning our attention to the Coast Guard. It is only because of this initial reporting on the Coast Guard and the maritime industry that we were able to ultimately break the news of the Fouled Anchor scandal. It took months to develop the trust of sources, obtain key records\u00a0and conduct sensitive interviews with victims. WOLF: A key part of the story is Operation Fouled Anchor, the secret internal probe of cover-ups. Has the Coast Guard acknowledged a cover-up?\u00a0 HICKEN and ELLIS: Reporting on this story has been so interesting because Fouled Anchor essentially ended up being a cover-up of past cover-ups.\u00a0The internal probe substantiated years of sexual assault at the US Coast Guard Academy and revealed how victims\u2019 complaints were ignored and, at times, covered up \u2013 allowing some offenders to rise to high-level positions in the Coast Guard and other military branches. Through our reporting, we learned that while there were originally plans to come clean to Congress about the reporting and its damning findings, Coast Guard leaders ultimately chose to bury it \u2013 even going so far as to make a list of pros and cons of disclosure. The Coast Guard\u2019s current leader has apologized to the workforce and Congress but has been careful to avoid calling the suppression of the Fouled Anchor investigation a cover-up. WOLF: Has there been any follow-up to look at some of those assaults from years ago? HICKEN and ELLIS: Operation Fouled Anchor itself was launched in 2014 to look at those earlier assaults when an academy graduate claimed that her allegations of rape from years earlier had never been investigated and her attacker had gone on to become a top officer in the Air Force. Despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, Fouled Anchor investigators found that most of the alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated at the time. Even after the cases were reopened during Fouled Anchor however, few alleged perpetrators were held accountable. The assailant in the case that started Fouled Anchor was the only person to face criminal charges in military court as a result of the probe, but an appeals court ended up ruling in his favor and dismissing the charges, saying that the military had missed its window to prosecute because the Coast Guard waited nearly two decades to investigate the victim\u2019s allegations. We learned that two other accused perpetrators were discreetly pushed to retire from the Coast Guard, but that there were nearly 40 cases where the Coast Guard no longer had jurisdiction over the alleged attackers and local and federal criminal statutes had long run out of time, so no action was taken at all. In terms of what is happening now, we know that the Coast Guard is currently investigating an officer for sexually harassing and groping a cadet who reported him to the academy two decades earlier\u00a0at the Coast Guard Academy (the officer\u2019s attorney denies the allegations). The former cadet brought up the allegations during\u00a0testimony\u00a0at a congressional hearing last year, but the Coast Guard didn\u2019t launch the criminal investigation until months later, after the woman said she flagged his name on a promotion list to senators. Another woman has asked Congress to reopen her rape case from 2005, which the Coast Guard has claimed it cannot pursue despite findings at the time that he had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her since he is not currently under Coast Guard jurisdiction. WOLF: There\u2019s a hearing in Congress this week. Shannon Norenberg resigned in protest. Has there been any accountability yet at the Coast Guard Academy or in the Coast Guard? HICKEN and ELLIS: It sounds like the Coast Guard\u2019s current leader, Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, will be facing a lot of tough questions at the hearing. So far, she has wanted the agency to focus on the future and make changes to policies that she hopes will help prevent sexual assault and better support survivors. But many Coast Guard members are frustrated by two major issues: that to date, the leaders who covered up Operation Fouled Anchor still haven\u2019t been held accountable and that Fagan is not acknowledging how much of an issue sexual assault still is in the service today. Shannon Norenberg was angry that she was used as part of what she described as a \u201ccruel coverup\u201d where victims and Congress were both deceived, but she is also frustrated that more hasn\u2019t changed at the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 saying perpetrators are still facing little accountability. WOLF: Having covered this for so long, what is it about the Coast Guard Academy that allowed this kind of cover-up culture to develop? Is this a problem specific to the Coast Guard or the academy? HICKEN and ELLIS: Many of the issues we have seen playing out at the Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard at large, such as fear of retaliation for speaking out about assaults, a lack of accountability for alleged perpetrators and a boys-club culture, were very similar to what we heard from those in the US Merchant Marine Academy community when we first started this reporting several years ago. We have also heard from assault survivors from across the military service who argue that our country still has a long way to go in combating military sexual assault and attempting to make survivors whole. We have also been told by some in the organization that because the Coast Guard does not fall under the Department of Defense, like the other military branches, that it has historically escaped the same level of scrutiny. Many are hopeful that maybe that can change with people who have been terrified to speak up finally feeling like they can. WOLF: You include your email addresses at the end of your stories and ask for tips to investigate. Does that ever turn into stories? HICKEN and ELLIS: Yes! We have received so much helpful information through tips in response to our stories, and many of the sexual assault survivors we have spoken with throughout our reporting originally contacted us through our tips email (watchdog@cnn.com). Many current and former Coast Guard employees have also shared information with us anonymously that has hugely informed our reporting and led to multiple follow-up stories. We\u2019re always looking for new story ideas, and a variety of our past investigations have stemmed from tips from readers, so we welcome emails!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/coast-guard-investigation-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_hunter-biden-jury", "text": "The jury in the Hunter Biden gun case was deadlocked in an initial vote Monday night over whether to convict the president\u2019s son, one of the jurors told CNN in an interview, adding that \u201cno politics came into play\u201d during deliberations before they arrived at a guilty verdict. The male juror, No. 10, also said that it was a mistake to put Hunter\u2019s daughter Naomi on the stand and that jurors felt bad that she was called to testify. Hunter Biden was found guilty Tuesday of all three federal felony gun charges he faced, with the jury concluding that he violated laws meant to prevent drug addicts from owning firearms. When the jury returned earlier that morning, there was only one remaining holdout, the juror who spoke with CNN said. Over the next few hours, he said, the jury discussed the elements of each crime and the last holdout agreed that they should return a guilty verdict. While the male juror did not say whether he was a supporter of President Joe Biden, he said he felt sympathy for the family\u2019s struggle with Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction. The president\u2019s son \u201cwas just like anybody else,\u201d Juror No. 10 told CNN. But, the juror said, he based his decision to convict on the fact that Biden did not disclose that he was a drug addict when he bought a gun. \u201cWe all knew he was a drug addict,\u201d he said. \u201cIn his mind, how could he not know he was an addict?\u201d Juror No. 10 said that the case boiled down to whether Biden was addicted to crack when he purchased the gun. \u201cAll 12 jurors did agree that, yes, he knowingly bought a gun when he was an addict, or he was addicted to drugs,\u201d he said. The juror, though, also said he doesn\u2019t believe Biden belongs in jail and pointed to the fact that he did not want the gun back after Hallie Biden (the widow of\u00a0Beau\u00a0Biden who later dated his brother) took it out of his truck and threw it in the garbage near a grocery store. \u201cWhen he said he did not want that gun back, and that gun sat in evidence for almost five years, I think that\u2019s what may have been what led to his downfall. If he had taken possession of that gun, I don\u2019t know if we would have even had a trial,\u201d the juror said. Another juror told CNN that she believed Biden \u201cneeds rehab more than imprisonment or a fine.\u201d Juror No. 10 said it didn\u2019t make a difference for him that Biden did not take the stand in his own defense and that he agrees Biden was \u201cbetter off not testifying.\u201d Ultimately, Juror No. 10 said, the unilateral guilty verdicts \u201ccame down to the rules.\u201d Other jurors who spoke to CNN after they reached the guilty verdict said that they believed they had no choice but to find Biden guilty but said that they question whether the criminal case ever should have been brought against the president\u2019s son. The case \u201cseemed like a waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d one female juror told CNN, though juror No. 10 disagreed. Another male juror said that the process was \u201ca little bit frustrating because it felt like we couldn\u2019t get the full story.\u201d All three jurors said that defense lawyer Abbe Lowell made them question whether Biden intentionally lied on an ATF form, but that ultimately his defense strategy was unconvincing. \u2018Politics played no part whatsoever\u2019 Jurors who spoke with CNN said politics never played a part in their decision-making process about whether to convict the president\u2019s son. The guilty verdict \u201cwas not politically motivated,\u201d Juror No. 10 told CNN. \u201cPolitics played no part whatsoever.\u201d A second juror said she was concerned that the jury would be \u201cat each other\u2019s throats because (Biden\u2019s) father is the president and because of the political climate,\u201d but that once deliberations began, she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel pressure.\u201d A third juror added: \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel the pressure.\u201d The president on Tuesday again reiterated that he would accept the jury\u2019s verdict in a statement following the guilty verdict, but he also expressed support for his son. \u201cAs I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. Juror No. 10 said that the president \u201cnever really even came in to play for me because his name was only brought up in one story in the trial. And that\u2019s when it \u2026 kind of sunk in a little bit. Oh, wow: This is the sitting president\u2019s son who\u2019s on trial. And so that was, yeah, that was kind of hard \u2026 but you kind of put that out of your mind. And after that, after it was brought up again, I did put it out in my mind.\u201d While the president was not in the courtroom, first lady Jill Biden was a fixture at the trial, showing support for her son. Each juror CNN spoke with acknowledged the weight of having her in the courtroom. \u201cWhen I looked at Mrs. Biden, I really felt bad for the family,\u201d Juror No. 10 said. He added that, while he didn\u2019t say how he planned to vote in the 2024 election, \u201cyou can\u2019t help but take some of these things into factor.\u201d \u2018Heart-wrenching\u2019 testimony from family Jurors said they recognized the emotional testimony in the case that saw Biden\u2019s family on the stand discussing some of the most intimate details of his struggle with drugs and alcohol. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Hunter\u2019s addiction was as bad as it was,\u201d Juror No. 10 said, adding that testimony from Biden\u2019s daughter was \u201cheart-wrenching.\u201d Naomi Biden testified about visiting her father in the summer of 2018 while he was in rehab in Los Angeles after not seeing him for some time. She came under intense cross-examination by prosecutors and was seen wiping away tears as she left the courtroom. \u201cI felt bad that they put Naomi on trial (as a) witness,\u201d Juror No. 10 told CNN. \u201cI think that was probably a strategy that should not have been done. No daughter should ever have to testify against her dad.\u201d The second juror said that she felt \u201cso sad\u201d for Naomi Biden and found her testimony difficult to listen to. Juror No. 10 said the panel did not focus heavily on Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201clifestyle,\u201d but rather, the evidence presented at the trial. \u201cIt was very sad. And Hallie testified, I mean, that was for me, that was a very sad time because I did not know that Hallie also got addicted to crack. So I really felt sorry for that,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_us-ukraine-security-agreement-g7", "text": "The US and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral security pact on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy on Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0CNN, in a deal that lays out a path for the US\u2019 long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations. The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and is expected to commit the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. But the pledge is expected to be an \u201cexecutive agreement,\u201d the sources said, making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has not explicitly said whether he would continue support for Ukraine if he wins in November, saying only that he would negotiate a quick end to the Russia-Ukraine war without explaining how. He has also pushed European countries to contribute more to their own defense and said he\u2019d \u201cencourage\u201d Russia \u201cto do whatever the hell they want\u201d if Europe didn\u2019t increase its defense funding. The US-Ukraine agreement does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine\u2019s defense, two of the sources familiar with the agreement said.\u00a0An annex in the agreement will lay out how the Biden administration plans to work with Congress on the implementation of the security commitments, one of the sources said, specifically the long-term funding that will be needed to support Ukraine\u2019s defense. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday that the US\u2019 commitment to Ukraine \u201cwill continue to be right up front and clear\u201d at the G7, and that the US \u201cwill take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine fight for freedom.\u201d President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet during the summit, Kirby said, and the US will announce steps to unlock Russia\u2019s frozen assets for use in Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction after the war ends. The pledge the US and Ukraine are expected to sign will be similar to the 14 other bilateral agreements Ukraine has already reached with other allies, including the UK, France and Germany.\u00a0The US-Ukraine agreement will be the 15th\u00a0such deal signed, one of the sources said, and 17 other countries have committed to negotiating similar bilateral security pacts with Ukraine. As part of the deal, the US will promise to hold consultations with Ukraine immediately following a future attack by Russia to determine next steps, said the people familiar with the agreement\u2019s contours. The UK, France and Germany also included provisions calling for such talks within 24 hours of a Russian attack. But the bilateral agreement with the US, like with Ukraine\u2019s other allies, will not include a mutual defense clause, which would commit them to defending Ukraine militarily in the event of another attack. While Zelensky has welcomed the bilateral commitments, he has said repeatedly that they are not a\u00a0substitute for full NATO membership, which does have a mutual defense provision known as Article V. The agreement comes as the US-Ukrainian relationship has begun to recover after faltering late last year and into this year amid a congressional fight over additional US funding for Ukraine \u2013 something Biden personally apologized to Zelensky for during a meeting in Paris last week. Biden also recently agreed to allow Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike into Russia directly, a major shift that Ukraine had been asking for months as Russia pummeled Kharkiv with missiles from just across the border.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/us-ukraine-security-agreement-g7/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_medical-debt-credit-reports-biden-ban", "text": "In its latest effort to minimize the impact of medical debt on consumers, the Biden administration proposed Tuesday banning such debt from credit reports. The move would remove medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, which would raise their credit scores by an average of 20 points and lead to the approval of about 22,000 more mortgages annually, according to a fact sheet from the office of Vice President Kamala Harris. It\u2019s one of the latest steps in the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to help people contend with higher costs of living as polls show voters are not pleased with President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. Some 46 million people had medical debt listed on their credit reports in 2020, according to the fact sheet. The proposed rule would also ban lenders from using medical devices, such as wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, as collateral for loans and bar them from repossessing the devices if patients are unable to repay the loans. The rule could be finalized early next year. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been considering proposals since last fall that would spare millions of Americans with unpaid medical bills from having that debt show up on credit reports. Creditors, who use these reports to make underwriting decisions when people apply for mortgages, car loans and other debt, would be able to use only nonmedical information in their evaluations. \u201cMedical debt makes it more difficult for millions of Americans to be approved for a car loan, a home loan or a small business loan, all of which in turn makes it more difficult to just get by, much less get ahead,\u201d Harris said on a call with reporters. \u201cAnd that is simply not fair, especially when we know that people with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those without medical debt.\u201d Also, debt collectors would no longer be able to use the listing of medical debt on credit reports as leverage to pressure consumers into paying questionable bills. Harris also called on states, localities and health care providers to take additional steps to eliminate medical debt, noting that $7 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funds are being used to wipe out the debt of up to nearly 3 million people by the end of 2026. Also, she asked them to expand access to charity care to minimize the accumulation of debt and to protect patients from aggressive debt collectors. Big burden There are varying estimates on just how many people have medical debt, but it\u2019s a sizable share of the population. In recent years, medical bills have become the most common collection item on credit reports, Rohit Chopra, the bureau\u2019s director, said on a call with reporters. Some 15 million Americans have a total of more than $49 billion in medical debt in collections, according to an April report from the bureau. That\u2019s down from the $88 billion the bureau reported in March 2022, after which the three nationwide credit reporting agencies announced they would no longer include certain medical debt on reports. Many health care bills contain mistakes, which can lead to extended battles among those in debt, health insurers and medical providers. \u201cOftentimes, we see this everywhere, people give up and pay a bill they don\u2019t actually owe just to get some peace of mind and to move on with their lives,\u201d Chopra said. Medical debt also hits the middle class particularly hard, according to a 2023 report from Third Way, a center-left think tank. Although these folks are more likely to have better health insurance coverage than lower-income Americans, the middle class is less likely to avoid care because of the cost but also less likely to qualify for financial assistance. At the same time, the middle class is less likely than higher-income Americans to have enough disposable funds to cover steep deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Almost a quarter of middle-class Americans, or 17 million people, had unpaid health care bills in 2020, according to Third Way. That compares with 22% of lower-income Americans and just under 13% of higher-income people, according to the report, which is based on US Census Bureau data. White House efforts The White House has\u00a0sought to lessen Americans\u2019 medical debt burden\u00a0as part of its effort to help people contend with inflation and higher costs of living. In 2022, it laid out a four-point plan to help protect consumers, including having the bureau investigate credit reporting companies and debt collectors that violate patients\u2019 and families\u2019 rights. Also in 2022, the three largest credit reporting agencies \u2013 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2013 announced they would remove nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports. The agencies no longer include medical debt that went to collections on consumer credit reports once it has been paid off. That eliminated billions of dollars of debt on consumer records. In addition, unpaid medical collection debt no longer appears on credit reports for the first year, whereas the previous grace period was six months. That gives people more time to work with their health insurers or providers to address the bills.

Some are not,\u201d Blinken said at a press conference in Doha, describing some of those changes as going \u201cbeyond positions (Hamas) had previously taken.\u201d Blinken, unlike an Israeli official who spoke to CNN earlier, did not go as far as to describe the response by Hamas as a rejection of the proposal, and said he believed that the \u201cgaps\u201d are \u201cbridgeable.\u201d Still, the top US diplomat made clear his exasperation at both the changes Hamas proposed and the length of time it took to reply \u2013 12 days. He did not go into specific details about the changes, but he continued to cast exclusive blame for the stalling of the deal \u2013 and the prolonging of the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza \u2013 on the US-designated terrorist group, not on Israel. \u201cIsrael accepted the proposal as it was,\u201d he reiterated, despite repeated public statements from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeming to cast doubt on\u00a0his\u00a0approval of\u00a0the proposal. \u201cHamas could have answered with a single word \u2013 yes,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point in a negotiation \u2013 and this has gone back and forth for a long time \u2013 you get to a point where if one side continues to change its demands, including making demands and insisting on changes for things that it had already accepted, you have to question whether they\u2019re proceeding in good faith or not,\u201d Blinken said in reference to Hamas. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the haggling to stop and a ceasefire to start. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday described \u201cmany\u201d of Hamas\u2019 proposed changes as \u201cminor and not unanticipated,\u201d but said \u201cothers differ more substantively from what was outlined in the UN Security Council resolution.\u201d That resolution, which passed the UN body on Monday, laid out the three phrases for the ceasefire and hostage release. In the first phase, there would be \u201can immediate, full, and complete ceasefire\u201d with the release of hostages and \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from the populated areas in Gaza.\u201d In phase two, \u201cupon agreement of the parties,\u201d there would be \u201ca permanent end to hostilities, in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\u201d Phase three would see \u201cthe start of a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of any deceased hostages still in Gaza to their families.\u201d A diplomatic source told CNN the Hamas response \u201ccontained amendments to the Israeli proposal, including a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip.\u201d A senior US administration official told CNN that \u201cthe goalposts are moving,\u201d in Hamas\u2019 response, and the group \u201cis now pressing for even greater specificity than it did before.\u201d The official had previously told CNN that what was on the table was \u201cpretty thin once you get past that first phase.\u201d \u201cHamas\u2019s requests would ultimately undermine the phased nature of the proposal on which agreement rests,\u201d the senior administration official said Wednesday. \u201cIt will be difficult to get Israel to agree to automaticity that the ceasefire will become permanent.\u201d While much of Blinken\u2019s trip to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Qatar had been centered on ratcheting up pressure on Hamas to take the proposal for an immediate ceasefire, it was also focused on developing plans for when a ceasefire is put into place. It is \u201ccrucial\u201d to move from an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza \u201cto an enduring end\u201d to the war, Blinken said Wednesday in some of his most straight-forward comments yet calling for the end to the eight-month long conflict. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we will put forward proposals for key elements of the \u2018day after\u2019 plan, including concrete ideas for how to manage governance, security, reconstruction,\u201d the top US diplomat said, without providing further details. Still, any movement on any of those aspects is contingent on an end to the fighting in Gaza, which has claimed the lives of more than 37,000 Palestinians and left the strip in what aid officials have described as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d humanitarian catastrophe. \u201cIn the days ahead, we are going to continue to push on an urgent basis with our partners, with Qatar, with Egypt, to try to close this deal,\u201d Blinken said Wednesday as he wrapped up his eighth round of shuttle diplomacy since the October 7 Hamas attack. Hamas submitted its reply to the multi-phased ceasefire and hostage release proposal to mediators on Tuesday. According to a senior State Department official, Blinken, who was in Amman at the time, dispatched two of the senior staff traveling with him to retrieve Hamas\u2019 response from Egyptian Intelligence Chief Abbas Kamel, who was also in the Jordanian capital. Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, described their response as \u201cresponsible, serious and positive.\u201d CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson, Hamdi Alkhshali and Benjamin Brown contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/blinken-expresses-frustration-at-changes-to-gaza-ceasefire-deal-requested-by-hamas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-hunter-biden-verdict", "text": "When Hunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve for using cocaine in 2014, his father \u2014 then-Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 wrote his family a concise message of summation. \u201cTime to move on,\u201d he said in an email. For the Bidens, moving on from Hunter\u2019s issues of addiction has proved almost impossible. Even with their son now sober and living in California with his young family, the darkest days of the family\u2019s lives continue to bear consequences in ways that weigh heavily on the president. Hunter Biden\u2019s guilty verdict on three federal gun charges Tuesday punctuated \u2014 but did not end \u2014 what has been a long and difficult saga. Joe Biden, who had planned to spend Tuesday night at the White House, returned late in the day to Delaware to surround himself with members of his family, many of whom spent the last week attending the trial. Greeting him at the steps to Marine One was his son, who only five hours earlier had left the downtown courthouse newly convicted. If the family felt anguished, they did not show it \u2014 at least not in view of the cameras. Instead, the president offered his family a warm smile, hugged Hunter Biden\u2019s young son, Beau, and gave him a kiss on the forehead. Joe Biden has little precedent to follow in navigating his son\u2019s conviction. Never before has a president\u2019s immediate family member been found guilty of a crime during their father\u2019s term in office. While the emotional weight and concern are shared by his family, doing so as president is a unique burden. Aside from the last-minute trip to Delaware \u2014 first floated as a possibility late Monday night, a source familiar with the plans said, with a final decision reached Tuesday afternoon following the verdict \u2014 the president\u2019s schedule wasn\u2019t altered. He still spoke Tuesday afternoon at an event on gun violence prevention in Washington, despite the political awkwardness of the subject matter. And he is still planning to travel to Italy on Wednesday for the G7. The display of warmth on the tarmac Tuesday was in keeping with the president\u2019s approach to his son\u2019s legal predicament. Instead of pushing him away, as some wary Democrats might prefer, the president has held Hunter Biden close throughout his ordeal. From the airport, where hugs were also exchanged between Biden family members and close aides, the group traveled in separate cars to the president\u2019s home in a leafy Wilmington neighborhood to process the developments in private. It has been behind closed doors that Joe Biden and his family have mostly kept their concerns over their son\u2019s legal issues. The president has been wary of speaking about the matter publicly, and it\u2019s not a topic aides raise easily. Asked during an interview with ABC last week about the case, Biden offered only one-word answers. \u201cYes,\u201d he would accept the verdict. \u201cYes,\u201d he had ruled out a pardon. The private nature of the circumstances in the case made the very public airing of traumatic moments during last week\u2019s trial all the more difficult. Tearful moments from the president\u2019s granddaughter Naomi deeply affected many family members. And the revelation that Hallie Biden \u2014 the widow of the president\u2019s late son, Beau Biden, who later had a relationship with Hunter Biden \u2014 had herself tried crack cocaine reverberated throughout the wider Biden orbit. In a statement following the verdict, Joe Biden framed the conviction through the lens of a father, not a president. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d the president wrote. He also sought to draw an implicit but clear distinction with former President Donald Trump, who has called the judicial system \u201crigged\u201d in the wake of his own felony conviction on charges of falsifying business records. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d What role the verdict will play in November\u2019s election remains difficult to discern, although Biden\u2019s aides and even many Republicans have downplayed the prospect of voters being swayed by the legal problems of the president\u2019s son. Biden aides \u2013 upon learning of the verdict \u2013 made clear to allies that despite the historic conviction of a sitting president\u2019s son, everything would be business as usual for the campaign, two sources familiar with the campaign\u2019s thinking said. Even as Hunter Biden\u2019s trial got underway, officials inside the president\u2019s campaign headquarters in Wilmington maintained that voters understand what they see as a black-and-white difference between Trump, who is a former president and now a convicted felon, and Hunter Biden, who \u2013 despite being the president\u2019s son \u2013 is a private citizen. One of the two sources said officials in Wilmington unsurprisingly discussed the guilty verdict, but the source declined to describe the tenor of those conversations. That reticence was a clear reflection of a reality that Biden allies know well: Few issues are more sensitive inside the White House and the president\u2019s reelection campaign operation than those related to his family. Perhaps more worrying than the political fallout, at least for some people close to Biden, is the personal toll the verdict could have on the president as he gears up for a bruising rematch against Trump. Biden, who speaks or texts with his son on a daily basis, has been concerned for his well-being throughout the legal saga. The president is still expected to spend ample time in the coming weeks preparing for his June 27 debate with Trump. And a day after one of the most painful moments for his family, Biden is expected to leave for a three-day trip to Italy for the G7 summit. The fluke of scheduling speaks to the balance Biden has been forced to strike throughout his son\u2019s legal proceedings. As the trial was underway last week, Biden was in France commemorating D-Day. Aides said the president was keeping track of the trial from overseas, and remained in touch with his son and first lady Jill Biden, who was a regular presence in the courtroom, along with their daughter Ashley, the president\u2019s brother James, and the first lady\u2019s sister Bonny Jacobs. Before and after that trip, the president spent a sizable amount of time with Hunter Biden in Delaware, including at the family beach home in Rehoboth the weekend before jury selection. He returned from France directly to the family home in Wilmington. That city rests at the very center of the Biden family identity. The train station the president passed through thousands of times as a senator and vice president is now named in his honor. The courthouse where the trial unfolded is named for the Republican senator Biden defeated in 1972. The president\u2019s reelection campaign is headquartered a few blocks away. Farther out of town is the home on a lake the Biden family has returned to in moments of joy and times of pain. The driveway out front is where, in the depths of Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, his father once chased his son after an attempted intervention, grabbed him close in the dark and cried. It is there the family retreated on Tuesday as they begin to work through the next chapter.

While the three felonies\u00a0Biden\u00a0was convicted of carry a maximum sentence of more than two dozen years behind bars, the sentencing\u00a0guideline, former federal prosecutor Tim Jansen told CNN, is between 15 and 21 months in prison. The actual sentence, however, will up to the judge. \u201cThey can go above or below the guidelines,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Jansen, who now works as a criminal defense attorney. \u201cAnd they usually have to put on the record why they\u2019re doing that.\u201d \u201cThe judge knows that this is the president\u2019s son,\u201d Jansen said, adding that given the security concerns and involvement of Secret Service protection, the judge could sentence Hunter\u00a0Biden\u00a0to a period of house arrest and probation. Federal District Judge Maryellen Noreika said the exact date for determining Biden\u2019s sentence would be decided later but noted that in Delaware, pre-sentence reports usually take four months,\u00a0which would place the sentencing in October, just before the November general election. During this time, pretrial services will, along with other things, investigate whether Biden has a previous criminal record or anything else that the judge would need to know before issuing a sentence. \u201cHe has no enhancements that I can see,\u201d Jansen said, noting\u00a0Biden\u2019s\u00a0lack of a previous criminal record. Jansen also said there was no mandatory minimum for the crimes\u00a0Biden\u00a0has been convicted of and that defense attorneys will likely ask the judge for a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines while prosecutors could ask for an increase President Joe Biden before the verdict said he would rule out a pardon for his son. But he was not asked about commuting a sentence, which he has the power to do in federal cases. The White House press secretary on Wednesday said she has not discussed the matter with the president. \u201cI have not spoken to the president about this. And what I\u2019m saying is he was asked about a pardon, he was asked about, he was asked about the trial specifically, and he answered it very clearly, very forthright,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_house-vote-merrick-garland-contempt", "text": "House Republicans voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interviews with former special\u00a0counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden\u2019s handling of classified material and\u00a0declined\u00a0to bring charges. The vote marks a major escalation in a monthslong dispute over the recordings between House Republicans and the executive branch that came after Biden\u00a0asserted executive privilege over the files. The vote was 216 to 207 with one\u00a0Republican\u00a0\u2013 Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio \u2013 voting against it. Garland said in a statement after the vote that it is \u201cdeeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department\u2019s need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees,\u201d Garland said. Now that the contempt resolution against Garland has succeeded, House Speaker Mike Johnson will certify the report to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia. Under law, this certification then requires the US attorney to \u201cbring the matter before the grand jury for its action,\u201d but the Justice Department will also make its own determinations for prosecuting. Democrats have used the process several times as they ran into uncooperative allies and former aides to Trump during their investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\u00a0The Department of Justice ultimately did not pursue charges against Trump aide Dan Scavino and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. But federal prosecutors did take two Trump allies, Stephen Bannon and former White House trade\u00a0adviser Peter Navarro to trial on the criminal contempt charges. Holding the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer in contempt builds on Republican allegations that the Justice Department has been weaponized against conservatives, claims that have been particularly ratcheted up in the wake of former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York for falsifying business records. Through their subpoena fight with the Justice Department,\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans have argued that the audio recordings are crucial to their impeachment inquiry into Biden, which remains\u00a0stalled\u00a0as the prospects of the investigation ending in impeachment are increasingly unlikely. House GOP leadership\u00a0said Tuesday evening that they were confident they had the votes in their narrow majority to hold Garland in contempt, but they worked behind the scenes to lock down their members ahead of Wednesday\u2019s floor vote. A handful of House Republicans had privately voiced concerns about supporting the contempt resolution, raising questions over whether the conference with its narrow majority would have the votes to pass it, a source familiar told CNN. Still, House Republicans announced Tuesday evening that the vote would go forward Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring it up and pass it (on Wednesday),\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told CNN ahead of the vote. Ahead of the vote, Garland released an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0declaring that he would not be intimidated by \u201cbaseless, personal and dangerous\u201d attacks, echoing the defiant stance he had while being grilled by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0earlier this month. In April,\u00a0CNN sued\u00a0for\u00a0access\u00a0to the recordings of Biden\u2019s interview. The back-and-forth over the audio recordings The monthslong clash between the House GOP and DOJ began when the trio of Republican-led committees leading the impeachment inquiry into the president subpoenaed\u00a0the department in February for transcripts, documents and audio recordings related to Hur\u2019s investigation. The department has made the majority of the subpoenaed materials available to House Republicans, including transcripts of the special counsel\u2019s interviews with Biden and his ghostwriter, and allowing Hur to testify on Capitol Hill in\u00a0March. But, DOJ has\u00a0stood by its decision not to release the audio files of the interviews, claiming that Republicans have not established a legitimate legislative purpose for demanding them. The Justice Department has also argued that the specific privacy concerns related to\u00a0an audio recording of an interview\u00a0are\u00a0distinct from those of a written transcript, and that the release of such an audio file could dissuade cooperation from future witnesses in criminal investigations. Republicans maintain that access to the tapes provide valuable information beyond what a written transcript can provide. In their contempt report they argued \u201cthe verbal nuances in President Biden\u2019s answers about his mishandling of classified information would assist the Committees\u2019 inquiry into whether he abused his office of public trust for his family\u2019s financial gain.\u201d Republicans have also said the DOJ must comply with the full extent of their subpoena instead of seeking to dictate what materials fulfilled their needs. \u201cThis is not a complicated matter,\u201d House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said at the markup of the contempt resolution against Garland on Tuesday. \u201cThe executive branch and its agencies, including the Department of Justice, are not above Congress\u2019 right to oversee those agencies. We, as members of the House of Representatives, have a duty to ensure congressional subpoenas are fully complied with by those who receive them,\u201d Comer added. Without supplying evidence to support his claims, Comer also claimed that part of the reason Republicans need the audio files is to determine whether the transcripts have been altered, and that it is \u201cinsufficient to simply take the Justice Department at its word.\u201d Meanwhile, the Biden administration has grilled Republicans about their motives for seeking the audio files. White House Counsel Edward Siskel has accused Republicans of wanting to distort the audio recordings. \u201cThe absence of a legitimate need for the audio recordings lays bare your likely goal \u2014 to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes,\u201d Siskel wrote. DOJ Assistant Attorney General Carlos Uriarte\u00a0has also\u00a0accused House Republicans of only wanting the audio recordings for political purposes given that the transcripts provide them with whatever they are looking for. \u201cIt seems that the more information you receive, the less satisfied you are, and the less justification you have for contempt, the more you rush towards it,\u201d Uriarte wrote. The special counsel report quickly became a political problem for the president, spotlighting an issue that has proven to be intractable for Biden: his age.\u00a0Republicans have seized on Hur\u2019s description of Biden as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d in his final report, a characterization that Biden has disputed, as they continue to go after the president in the lead up to the November election. The White House and Biden\u2019s campaign reacted furiously to Hur\u2019s characterization of the president, launching a fierce defense aimed at beating back the special counsel\u2019s allegations that Biden was forgetful \u2014 particularly on the matter of whether the president recalled the year in which his son died. In the lead up to Wednesday\u2019s contempt vote, Democrats bashed their Republican colleagues for pursuing contempt of Garland. \u201cThere is plainly no basis for holding Attorney General of the United States Merrick Garland in contempt unless we are going to start holding people in contempt for complying with the committee\u2019s demands,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said on Tuesday. Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York accused Republicans of pursuing contempt of Garland on behalf of Trump. \u201cThis resolution may boost Donald Trump\u2019s spirits before his sentencing for his conviction on 34 felonies, but it will certainly not convince the Department of Justice to produce the one remaining file in question,\u201d he said. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments. CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_trump-rnc-abortion-platform", "text": "Anti-abortion leaders are warning Republicans not to remove a federal abortion ban from the party\u2019s platform at next month\u2019s GOP convention even as their presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, backs away from it. The current platform \u2013 put in place during Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for president and left unchanged when he ran for reelection four years later\u00a0\u2013 calls on Congress to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks and for an amendment to the US Constitution giving the unborn the same rights as a person. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said it better stay that way. \u201cOur expectation is that the GOP platform will continue to unequivocally call for national protections for unborn children, rooted in the 14th Amendment,\u201d Dannenfelser told CNN in a statement. \u201cWatering down the GOP platform\u2019s stance on life would entail an abandonment of its defense of the human dignity of all people.\u201d The sentiment was echoed last week by Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a close ally of the former president. Speaking during a virtual event hosted by the Washington Post, Reed publicly urged the Trump campaign \u201cto proceed with great caution in sending any message of vacillation or retreat when it comes to the defense of the innocent unborn.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be either morally sound or politically advisable for the party to signal retreat on the sanctity of innocent human life in its platform,\u201d he said. CNN has asked Trump\u2019s campaign for comment. A senior Trump adviser told CNN that the campaign expects the party will vote on a platform \u201cthat reflects the policy and vision and agenda of President Trump.\u201d \u201cThe platform is something that always gets renewed, revived, sort of amended. The whole process occurs in the executive sessions that lead up to the actual convention,\u201d the adviser added. \u201cWe will work with the delegations and the representatives on each committee that has work to do to make sure that we have a great convention and we have we have a representation of the President\u2019s leadership of the party as the nominee.\u201d The forewarnings speak to the concern that Trump\u2019s aboutface on abortion will permeate throughout a party he has seized control of. After watching the political landscape tilt against Republicans in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump backed away from strict anti-abortion laws. During the Republican presidential primary, as many of his rivals fought for the support of evangelical voters by pushing for federal bans on the procedure, Trump angered some anti-abortion advocates and Christian leaders by refusing to take a stance. Then, after wrapping up the\u00a0GOP nomination, Trump said the future of abortion access should be left up to the states. In April, he asserted he wouldn\u2019t sign a national\u00a0abortion ban even if it passed through Congress \u2013 a total reversal from what he said when he ran for president in 2016. The former president\u2019s shift has come as his party is preparing its first official position on abortion since the 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ended the Constitutional right to an abortion \u2013 a victory made possible by Trump\u2019s overhaul of the US Supreme Court. But Republicans and anti-abortion groups have struggled to find their next target and have suffered a series of setbacks, including a recent winless streak in state ballot referendums. For the past four decades, the GOP platform voted on at the party\u2019s quadrennial convention has backed federal efforts to curb the procedure, either by awarding a fetus 14th amendment protection or through legislation like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Trump would not be the first Republican presidential nominee to appear at odds with the party platform on abortion. Both John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 supported exemptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother, all of which were ultimately not included in the party\u2019s platform. Trump, too, argued for similar exemptions in 2016 but was overruled by the party. \u201cWe hear this every four years: a battle between the candidate and the party,\u201d said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. \u201cIt gets a lot of media hype and not a lot changes. I\u2019m not expecting any major changes this year.\u201d \u201cWe know this isn\u2019t something that will be decided in the next couple years. This is a long-term battle. Pro-lifers had been trying to overturn Roe for almost 50 years so we have a long-term mentality.\u201d But if anti-abortion advocates get their way this time, the GOP would enter the election with a wider chasm between a Republican nominee and the party platform on abortion than at any point since the court\u2019s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade turned the issue into a national battle. Trump has publicly and privately criticized how his party has navigated post-Dobbs politics, blaming abortion for the GOP\u2019s underwhelming midterm performance in 2022. His attempts to recalibrate his position have come as President Joe Biden and Democrats have made clear they intend to hammer Trump over his monumental role in helping overturn Roe, allowing states like Texas and Florida to pass near-total bans on the procedure. Earlier this week, as Trump prepared to address the Danbury Institute, a coalition of Christian groups, the Biden campaign blasted the former president for giving an audience to a group that wants to ban abortion nationwide. \u201cTrump brags that he is responsible for overturning Roe, he thinks the extreme state bans happening now because of him are \u2018working very brilliantly,\u2019 and if he\u2019s given the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban,\u201d Biden spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \u201cThese are the stakes this November.\u201d In his brief recorded remarks, Trump told the groups he hopes to be defending their values \u201cside-by-side for your next four years.\u201d \u201cThese are gonna be your years because you\u2019re gonna make a comeback like just about no other group,\u201d he said. Though Trump has not yet made clear where he\u00a0stands on the platform, his campaign enters the convention having asserted control of the GOP at nearly every level. The party is led by Trump\u2019s handpicked co-chair: his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and former North Carolina Republican Party leader Michael Whatley. The platform committee will be led by three close allies: Randy Evans, his former ambassador to Luxembourg; Russell Vought, a top official in the Trump administration; and Ed Martin, president of the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles who in 2016 wrote the book \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d The platform committee will also consist of two delegates, a man and woman, from each state and territory delegation to the party\u2019s Milwaukee convention. They will meet early next month and present their report when the full convention meets the week of July 15. Reed told CNN he has discussed the platform with the Trump campaign and expects the party\u2019s position will remain \u201cunapologetically pro-life\u201d but stopped short of saying he has won that guarantee. He insisted, though, there\u2019s not much daylight between the party\u2019s platform and Trump\u2019s latest stance. \u201cThe president\u2019s position simply reflects the short term political reality for both sides: Neither side has the votes to pass federal legislation that reflects their values and aspirations,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe action is at the state level. The long term political reality is whoever wins that battle at the state level will build the momentum and gain the votes to achieve what they want at the federal level.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/trump-rnc-abortion-platform/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to try to depict Democrats as the \u201ctrue radicals\u201d on abortion policy. To make his case, though, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made wildly inaccurate claims. In a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump said, \u201cHard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born. Killing a person after birth is illegal in every state. \u201cEvery state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no basis for this claim,\u201d Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: \u201cThe falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.\u201d There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified \u201cother places.\u201d But he was wrong then, too: New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though false social media posts claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator\u2019s 2022 bill that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was revised before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee acknowledged that the early text\u2019s vague use of the phrase \u201cperinatal death\u201d might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom clarified that the \u201cperinatal death\u201d immunity is specifically for \u201cperinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.\u201d In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the false claim that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: \u201cI say, let the states decide. This is \u2014 every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN.  \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d Maya Manian, an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned,\u00a0said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has falsely claimed over and over this year that Iran was so impoverished because of his policies as president that it did not provide any money to terror groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. \u201cIran was, as you know, they were broke. They weren\u2019t funding Hamas, and they weren\u2019t funding anything. They weren\u2019t funding Hezbollah,\u201d Trump, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May interview with right-wing host Dan Bongino. In a June interview with Phil McGraw, the personality known as Dr. Phil, Trump\u00a0claimed Hamas would have never perpetrated its October attack on Israel if he had still been president, \u201cbecause Iran was broke and Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hamas and they weren\u2019t funding any of the terrorists \u2013 Hezbollah, all of them,\u00a0there\u2019s like 28 of them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Iran wasn\u2019t funding Hezbollah, Hamas or any other terror group during his presidency is false. Iran\u2019s funding for such groups\u00a0did\u00a0decline\u00a0in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his\u00a0sanctions\u00a0on Iran had a\u00a0major negative impact\u00a0on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN this week. Trump\u2019s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah.\u00a0 Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups\u00a0(though it\u2019s\u00a0unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his\u00a0years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements. Pompeo said Iran continued to fund terror in 2020. Experts agree Research institutions in the US and Israel have reported that Iran\u2019s financial relationship with Hamas\u00a0actually\u00a0grew\u00a0stronger\u00a0in 2017, the first calendar year of Trump\u2019s presidency, after several years of frostiness related to divisions between Tehran and Hamas over the war in Syria. The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in\u00a0late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d But\u00a0Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups. \u201cSo you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically \u2013 continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,\u201d Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a\u00a0transcript posted on the State Department\u2019s website. Earlier that week, during a visit to Israel, Pompeo\u00a0told reporters\u00a0that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to limit the money the Iranian regime has available to inflict harm around the world \u201chas borne fruit, it has been successful,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay at it. There is still work to do on that file as well.\u201d He said, \u201cEven during this pandemic, the Iranians [are] using the ayatollahs\u2019, the regime\u2019s, resources to foment terror across the world\u00a0even when the people of Iran are struggling so mightily.\u201d Four experts told CNN this week that Iran\u2019s funding for Hezbollah and Hamas never vanished under Trump. \u201cIt absolutely did not and has not,\u201d said\u00a0Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cDefinitely it didn\u2019t stop. It decreased, yes,\u201d said\u00a0Hanin Ghaddar, senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cI would say it slowed down, but it never stopped entirely,\u201d said\u00a0Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group. \u201cIran has never ceased funding many of its core proxy groups\u201d such as Hezbollah, said\u00a0Phillip Smyth, who\u00a0studies Iran\u2019s proxies. \u201cThey are hyper-focused on continuing these relationships and proxy building efforts. However, sanctions do take a toll on some of their operations/abilities to build proxies.\u201d A funding cut, but funding continued Iran does not disclose how much money it gives to Hezbollah, Hamas and other foreign armed groups. Brian Hook, who served as the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran under Trump,\u00a0claimed\u00a0in 2019 that Iran \u201chas provided Hezbollah almost $700 million annually and gave more than $100 million a year to Palestinian terrorist groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\u201d Hook\u00a0declined in June 2020\u00a0to publicly say how much less money Iran was spending on foreign activities than it had before Trump launched the pressure campaign, but he pointedly noted media reports about Iranian proxies receiving less than they had before.\u00a0Pompeo also\u00a0touted this reduction\u00a0in August 2020. In 2019, The Washington Post\u00a0published an in-depth report\u00a0explaining that, because Iran\u2019s financial situation had been worsened by Trump policy, Hezbollah had \u201cseen a sharp fall in its revenue and is being forced to make draconian cuts to its spending, according to Hezbollah officials, members and supporters.\u201d Reuters\u00a0published a report in 2020\u00a0about how Iran had slashed its payments to Shiite militia groups in Iraq because of the impact of the US sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Iran reduced its publicly disclosed military budget under Trump. The\u00a0Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which monitors countries\u2019 military spending,\u00a0reported\u00a0that Iranian military spending declined 20% between 2018 and 2020. Still, there\u2019s no doubt Iran\u2019s unspecified spending on foreign armed groups continued to some significant extent even after these cuts. The State Department\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0on international terrorism in 2020 made clear that Iranian support for terror entities endured in the last calendar year of Trump\u2019s term. \u201cIran continued to support acts of terrorism regionally and globally during 2020. Regionally, Iran supported proxies and partner groups in Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, including Hizballah and Hamas,\u201d the report, released in 2021, said. \u201cSenior (al Qaeda) leaders continued to reside in Iran and facilitate terrorist operations from there. Globally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force remained the primary Iranian actors involved in supporting terrorist recruitment, financing, and plots across Europe, Africa, and Asia, and both Americas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_joe-biden-g7", "text": "When Joe Biden arrived to his very first G7 summit in Cornwall, England, the newly inaugurated American president \u2014 in the telling of some US officials who were in attendance \u2014 was greeted by his fellow world leaders with enthusiasm \u2013 and relief. The heads of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries could see with their own eyes that summer the chaotic four years of Donald Trump were over. The unpredictable, celebrity-turned-president who had alienated the US in so many ways had been replaced by a familiar American statesman, and he was pledging to restore and strengthen American alliances and its leadership on the world stage. When Biden touches down in Brindisi, Italy, on Wednesday almost exactly three years later to the day to attend the final G7 meeting of his first term, the shadow of his predecessor will once again loom large. \u201cThere was a real sense of relief in the room that America was back, and actually leading at the table. And that\u2019s still more true now than ever,\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday. \u201cThe President\u2019s message at that\u00a0G7\u00a0in Cornwall was that we need to step up in solidarity and demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people, and for people all over the world. And for the past few years, we\u2019ve done that.\u201d Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House adds weight to the question of how much Biden\u2019s bet on repairing America\u2019s alliances abroad has paid off. Anxiety has set in in world capitals as some governments look beyond Biden and instead work to curry favor with the presumptive Republican nominee. Biden and his fellow group of world leaders \u2013 huddled for three days in a luxury resort in Puglia on the Mediterranean coastline that has been frequented by Hollywood celebrities and diplomats alike \u2013 will tackle questions of war and peace, a fragile economic recovery and competing against China. Trump\u2019s isolation from his fellow leaders was on display the last time Italy hosted the G7 summit, in 2017. Perched on a cliffside resort in Sicily, Trump resisted entreaties to remain in the Paris climate accord. An enduring memory from the gathering was Trump trailing behind the leaders in a golf cart as the rest of the group toured a small piazza on foot. As the highly anticipated summit kicks off this year, Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine that began in early 2022 is showing no signs of letting up. With the conflict grinding on, Biden\u2019s rallying cry championing Ukraine\u2019s fight for its survival has fallen on increasingly unsympathetic ears \u2013 and even growing resistance \u2013 in some corners of Washington. A big enough contingent of Republicans lawmakers, balking in no small part at the growing price tag of US security assistance to Ukraine, delayed the approval of the last American aid package for months. US officials have publicly lamented the delay, claiming it hamstrung Ukrainian forces at a pivotal moment in the war, allowing Russia to make key advances on the battlefield. \u201cBiden has been trying to allay concerns of allies for the last four years. The message that he ran on and the message of his presidency has been: \u2018America is back,\u2019\u201d said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Europe Center. \u201cAnd I think the question a lot of leaders are asking themselves is: Is it really? Because what we\u2019re seeing in the United States is a serious fight on Capitol Hill in terms of Ukraine funding.\u201d Visiting France last week to commemorate the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day, Biden drew parallels between the US and its allies standing up against Russia\u2019s tyranny over Ukraine and the fight against Nazi Germany in World War II. \u201cIsolation was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,\u201d Biden said, as he vowed: \u201cWe will not walk away.\u201d He also issued a public apology to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the latest delay in US security assistance to the country. Biden and Zelensky will participate in a news conference together in Italy during the G7 summit, according to Kirby. \u201cWe will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom,\u201d Kirby said. As frequently as Biden has pointed to the war in Ukraine as having so far proven the strength and value of the NATO alliance, the conflict has tested not only Biden, but a number of his counterparts, back in their home countries. Among the G7 leaders that gather in Italy this week include French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who both suffered political losses to the far-right in European Parliament elections this weekend. Even despite some of those headwinds at home, the leaders of the seven nations are racing against the clock to approve a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. The Biden administration has been leading a campaign to persuade leaders of the fellow G7 nations to sign off on a plan that it views as vital to giving Ukraine a shot at turning around its prospects on the battlefield. The ultimate goal is to iron out some of the thorniest financing details in the coming days so that an agreement can be announced as part of the G7 leaders\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the week. But questions about the modalities of such a program \u2013 including the precise form of disbursement and repayment assurances, among others \u2013 are still in the process of being worked out. One source familiar with planning for the summit said that the leaders were expected to speak in unison about their concerns about a \u201cresurgence\u201d of the Russian military \u2013 and the threat that poses not only to Ukraine\u2019s future, but more broadly, European, NATO and transatlantic security. Leaders also plan to discuss what the US views as Chinese manufacturing overcapacity and concerns about Beijing flooding the global market beyond existing demand \u2013 echoing what was a significant focus of last year\u2019s G7 gathering. US officials have consistently expressed concern about economies across the world being over-reliant on Chinese goods, and reducing China\u2019s economic dominance has been a key feature of Biden\u2019s first-term foreign policy. Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center, told reporters on a call previewing this year\u2019s summit that the world leaders invited who are not officially a member of the G7 alliance speaks volumes about the stakes of the moment. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, newly sworn in for a third term; Pope Francis; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan; Argentinian President Javier Milei; and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio\u00a0Lula\u00a0da Silva are all expected to participate in this week\u2019s meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the G7 meeting, it\u2019s actually the top 10 largest economies in the world minus China,\u201d Lipsky said. \u201cIt all conveys a sense of urgency and the stakes around this G7. And it has a feeling to me of last chance to do something big before things may change significantly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/joe-biden-g7/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_south-carolina-republican-primary-nancy-mace", "text": "South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace won the Republican primary for the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, staving off two challengers and a push by allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whom she voted to oust. By taking a majority of the vote Tuesday, Mace avoids a June 25 primary runoff in her quest for a third term representing the coastal Charleston-area seat. Tuesday\u2019s outcome comes as\u00a0a much-needed win for Mace, who has become an increasingly polarizing figure within her party. She has faced waves of criticism over the past several months, including accusations that she created a toxic workplace to anger over votes by her and seven other Republicans to boot McCarthy from the speakership in October. Days after the move, Mace wore a white T-shirt with a red \u201cA\u201d on the front, a reference to the novel \u201cThe Scarlet Letter\u201d and what she described as a demonization of her vote. McCarthy sought his revenge at the ballot box, with his allies spending millions attacking Mace during the primary. The congresswoman and groups backing her painted chief opponent Catherine Templeton \u2013 a former South Carolina Cabinet official under Republican Gov. Nikki Haley \u2013 as a McCarthy puppet. Mace has faced criticism for her evolving relationship with former President Donald Trump. After the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, Mace told CNN that Trump\u2019s \u201centire legacy was wiped out\u201d that day. In the run-up to the 2022 midterm elections, Trump backed her primary opponent Katie Arrington. Among Mace\u2019s chief backers in that primary was Haley, who campaigned with Mace and appeared in a TV ad on her behalf.\u00a0Mace went on to defeat Arrington by 8 points. Two years later, Mace endorsed Trump over Haley ahead of South Carolina\u2019s Republican presidential primary. The former president endorsed Mace in March, calling her a \u201cstrong conservative voice.\u201d Mace was first elected in 2020, when she narrowly unseated Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham. She comfortably won reelection two years later after the district was redrawn to become more favorable to the GOP. A three-judge panel concluded last year that the district\u2019s new lines amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. But the US Supreme Court upheld the new map last month, rejecting the argument that state lawmakers had impermissibly used race as a proxy to bolster the GOP\u2019s chances. Trump-backed congressman survives hard-line challenge Meanwhile, in the state\u2019s 4th Congressional District, Republican Rep. William Timmons won his primary, becoming the latest GOP lawmaker to fight off a challenge from his right flank this year. Timmons, who had Trump\u2019s endorsement, defeated\u00a0state Rep. Adam Morgan, who had the backing of several members of the House Freedom Caucus and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. In a primary that was largely focused on style over substance, Morgan and his allies argued that Timmons was unwilling to buck party leadership, including McCarthy. Timmons pointed to his conservative record and other key endorsements, including from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, House Speaker Mike Johnson and conservative Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Gaetz and other GOP hard-liners have had limited success this cycle in backing primary challengers to their colleagues. Republican Reps. Tony Gonzales of Texas and Don Bacon of Nebraska are among several House Republicans who have beaten back challenges from their right this year. Timmons was first elected to office in 2018, succeeding Republican Trey Gowdy in the Upstate South Carolina seat, which includes Greenville and Spartanburg.\u00a0In 2022, Timmons was accused of engaging in an extramarital affair, which he has denied. He and his wife divorced that same year. Timmons held a big\u00a0advantage over Morgan in the money race, raising more than $1.9 million through May 22, compared\u00a0with\u00a0$578,000 by his opponent. The incumbent was also boosted by outside spending, including super PAC ads\u00a0that described\u00a0him as tough on the border and touted his endorsement from McMaster.

{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_trump-european-union-elections-analysis", "text": "In June 2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union in a populist revolt that foreshadowed Donald Trump\u2019s shock outsider election win a few months later. Now, in June 2024, far-right candidates, many of whom share Trump\u2019s populist nationalism, hostility to immigrants, searing economic message, and disdain for governing elites and globalist institutions, just won sweeping gains in EU elections. Is political lightning about to strike twice? US voters don\u2019t take direction from foreigners, and American presidential elections, which play out state by state, are far different from those for the European Union. Plus, Trump\u2019s win eight years ago had more to do with the deficiencies of Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign than Brexit. But President Joe Biden should be concerned. The latest campaign in Europe successfully road-tested a message that mixes a potent political cocktail \u2014 public anger over what is perceived to be out-of-control migration, the pain of voters facing high prices and the cost to individuals of fighting climate change. Trump is hitting these themes hard in battleground states that will decide the White House race. Another lesson of the European elections is that in an age of inflation, incumbents are vulnerable to a disgruntled electorate. When Biden arrives at the G7 summit in Italy this week, he\u2019ll join a quartet of four other politically diminished Western leaders. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are smarting from their rebuke in European elections that rewarded far-right parties that echo the continent\u2019s dark past. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s low approval ratings mean he might not even lead his Liberal Party into elections due by the end of next year. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is expected to be wiped out in next month\u2019s general election after 14 years of Conservative rule. Ironically, the most secure European leader at the G7 will be Giorgia Meloni, the right-wing prime minister of Italy, a country known for dispensing with leaders at a hectic rate. Meloni\u2019s party won big over the weekend, making her one of the most powerful leaders on the other side of the Atlantic. A saving grace for Biden might be that the US election is not a traditional face-off between an insurgent outsider and an unpopular sitting president. Trump is, in many ways, an incumbent himself who boasts a controversial White House legacy and carries heavy political baggage as a twice-impeached and convicted former president. And populist nationalism isn\u2019t on the rise everywhere. Biden led a surprisingly successful midterm election campaign against \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d influences in the GOP in 2022. An expected return to power by the Labour Party in Britain next month would buck the trend of ascendant right-wing parties. And Poland just rejected eight years of populist rule that drew inspiration from Trump. Macron reacted to the surge of the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen with a bold gambit that stunned commentators watching his post-election speech in TV studios. He dissolved Parliament and called new elections. The National Rally is an evolution of the ultra-right-wing anti-immigrant National Front, which has never managed to navigate the country\u2019s two-round electoral system to win the presidency. Le Pen has now moderated some policies to appeal to a broader group of voters. Macron, who heads a centrist party that was routed in the European elections, may be betting that the higher turnout in legislative elections could reverse the trend. A post-election anti-far-right coalition could also emerge in Parliament. But if the National Rally wins the two-part elections that culminate weeks before the Paris Olympics, Macron may be forced to appoint 28-year-old far-right star Jordan Bardella as prime minister in an awkward cohabitation deal. Cynics wonder whether Macron secretly hopes that a far-right government could be so disastrous that it could tarnish Le Pen\u2019s hopes of succeeding him in 2027. Macron told voters his gamble was based on trust \u201cin the capacity of the French people to make the most just choice for themselves and for future generations.\u201d He\u2019s implicitly beseeching voters despondent about the economy to save the foundational values of their country, billing his announcement as an act of \u201ctrust in our democracy.\u201d That\u2019s rather similar to the warning that American democracy is in deep peril and needs to be saved by voters, which Biden spelled out at Macron\u2019s side last week during the 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day Normandy landings. That\u2019s why the White House will be watching French election results on July 7 even more closely than Sunday\u2019s EU contests.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/trump-european-union-elections-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_antony-blinken-gaza-aid-humanitarian", "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday announced more than $400 million in new humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza as he again called on Hamas to accept a ceasefire proposal that he described as the most effective way to address the humanitarian devastation. The top US diplomat, speaking at an emergency humanitarian aid conference in Jordan, also called on nations to give more aid to support those in the war-torn strip. The humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza has become catastrophic over the eight months of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. The Israeli government has restricted access and items that have been able to make their way into the strip. Humanitarian aid organizations have had to contend with a destroyed infrastructure inhibiting their ability to deliver the critically-needed aid, and aid workers have been caught in the crossfire. \u201cThe crisis in Gaza is immense,\u201d Blinken acknowledged. \u201cOnly one third of the current United Nations appeal is funded. That leaves a shortfall of approximately $2 billion to $3 billion. Every country can help fill this gap. Yet some who expressed great concern over the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, including countries with the capacity to give a lot, have provided very little \u2013 or nothing at all,\u201d Blinken said without naming specific countries. \u201cIt is time for everyone, everyone, to step up.\u201d The new $404 million in funding from the US will go toward \u201cfood, safe drinking water, health care, protection, education, shelter, and psychosocial support,\u201d according to a media note from the State Department. In his remarks Tuesday, Blinken said that \u201cparticularly in recent months, Israel has taken some important steps to open more crossings, to address obstacles to the delivery of assistance, but it can and must do more.\u201d \u201cAs we conveyed directly to the Israeli government, it is crucial to speed up the inspection trucks and reduce backlogs, to provide greater clarity on and shorten the list of prohibited goods, to increase visas for aid workers and to process them more quickly, to create clearer, more effective channels for humanitarian groups to deconflict with IDF operations, to surge life-saving medicine and equipment, to provide everything necessary to repair water and sanitation systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Israel must take further steps to reduce civilian casualties, even as it confronts an enemy that started this war with the barbaric slaughter of civilians on October 7,\u201d Blinken said. Despite Blinken\u2019s claims about the \u201cimportant steps\u201d taken by the Israeli government, humanitarian workers say that the situation on the ground has only worsened, particularly as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in Rafah, where millions of Palestinians previously fled. Blinken himself acknowledged in his remarks Tuesday that \u201cmore than a million people have been displaced from\u00a0Rafah\u00a0alone, in the last month alone \u2013 many of whom had already been uprooted multiple times.\u201d \u201cThe situation is back to one of the lowest points, which is quite shocking at this point,\u201d said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East director at Mercy Corps. There was an \u201cecosystem\u201d for humanitarian aid work in Rafah \u2013 some non-governmental organizations and UN agencies provide logistical facilities, others provide transportation, \u201ceverybody works together to make that possible,\u201d he described to CNN. But with the Israeli military operation happening since the beginning of May, \u201cit could not function anymore, it just ground to a halt.\u201d International officials and humanitarian workers have described the situation in Gaza as unprecedented in its complexity and scope. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference Tuesday that \u201cthe speed and scale of the carnage and killing in Gaza is beyond anything in my years as Secretary-General.\u201d The top US diplomat in his remarks stressed that the US sees Hamas as the sole obstacle to a ceasefire that would alleviate the humanitarian suffering. \u201cToday, as we gather, one, and only one, thing stands in the way of the deal happening, and that\u2019s Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cSo my primary and first message today to every government, to every multilateral institution, to every humanitarian organization that wants to relieve the massive suffering in Gaza: get Hamas to take the deal.\u201d Others also emphasized the need for a ceasefire in order to enable humanitarian work. \u201cThe status quo cannot hold. Without a political agreement supporting a ceasefire, the humanitarian assistance system is pushed to a point of collapse,\u201d said Mirjana Spoljaric, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, at the conference on Tuesday.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_john-roberts-recording-what-matters", "text": "The funny thing about \u201csecret\u201d recordings made of public figures is that they generally confirm what everyone already knew. The propriety of liberal activist Lauren Windsor pretending to be a religious conservative in order to surreptitiously record Supreme Court justices attending a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society can certainly be debated. The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_g7-ukraine-loan-agreement-announcement", "text": "Leaders representing the Group of Seven nations are set to announce as soon as Thursday an agreement to loan money to Ukraine backed by the profits from frozen Russian investments, according to sources familiar with the discussions, providing a new source of revenue to a war-torn nation facing a steep and costly road to recovery. Negotiators had focused discussions on a loan amount of roughly $50 billion, a figure that would represent the annual proceeds on the investments \u2013 which generate profit of about EUR 3 billion per year \u2013 over the course of 10 years. Western nations froze Russia\u2019s assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount \u2013 roughly $3 billion \u2013 located in banks in the US. That led European officials to raise concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit, or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal. A senior US official says negotiators, who have continued working out final details in Brindisi, Italy, ahead of the G7 leaders\u2019 arrival, have structured the deal so that all countries participating share the risk. \u201cThis loan will mostly be provided by the United States and will be supplemented by money from Europe,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told journalists at a briefing. \u201cCountries are still discussing how to partition the cost if the profits from Russian assets are not sufficient to cover the need,\u201d the French source added. The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing professional norms in Europe. \u201cThe $50 billion will be transferred before the end of 2024,\u201d the source said. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with President Joe Biden to the summit that the discussions were moving toward a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of how the loan would be structured, though\u00a0multiple countries would participate and work out the technical details\u00a0after the summit. \u201cI believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use,\u201d Sullivan said. G7 countries began brainstorming ways to identify longer-term sources of funding for Ukraine in late 2023, as lawmakers delayed in greenlighting the White House\u2019s funding request. Amid doubts on future political and financial wherewithal to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine \u2013 and facing a calendar stacked with elections on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 officials began zeroing in on the Russian money gathering dust and interest payments in accounts around the world. Beginning in early 2023, working groups led by Treasury, State and the National Security Council officials held three, two-hour meetings each week beginning at 7 a.m. ET to accommodate time differences around the world. Banks and clearing houses that hold and process the funds raised concerns that simply taking the money would open up companies and countries alike to lawsuits and retribution from Russia. Utilizing the profits generated while Russia has no access to the money was conceived as a workaround that satisfied international legal concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between someone seizing your home and renting\u00a0out\u00a0your home,\u201d said Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance. The United States has provided $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion, a total that now surpasses the $171 billion in 2024 dollars that the US provided to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. The European Union has delivered $107 billion in aid. The World Bank estimates that Ukraine would need more than $500 billion to rebuild, a figure that climbs each day the war continues.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters", "text": "Hunter Biden has never sought elective office or been part of a presidential administration, but he has loomed large in the American political conversation for years. His conviction in Delaware, the first federal criminal trial of a president\u2019s son in US history, is for allegedly lying on a federal firearms background check and owning a firearm for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs and could land him behind bars. It has put a personal drama of addiction and betrayal in the public eye, an unwanted embarrassment for the Biden family. Read more from CNN\u2019s team covering the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, his brother\u2019s widow \u2013 with whom he had an affair \u2013 and his daughter all testified. Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction will also serve as a sort of foil for former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction for lying on business records in New York. That\u2019s not to equate the two sets of charges or the trials. Trump was convicted for hiding his compensation of hush money paid to keep an alleged affair out of the media during the 2016 presidential campaign. He is also running again in the 2024 presidential election, while Hunter Biden is now an artist. Hunter Biden also faces tax evasion charges in Los Angeles later this year, another case brought by the former Trump-appointed US attorney turned special counsel whose planned plea deal with Biden to settle both the gun and tax problems imploded last year when a Trump-appointed judge refused to accept it. Trump feared a Joe Biden candidacy ahead of the 2020 election, and hoping to tarnish Biden\u2019s reputation, in 2019 he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to spin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. Trump pushed Zelensky to focus on Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as vice president, at a time when Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. Joe Biden was one of many Western leaders who had advocated for the ouster of a prosecutor in Ukraine because he was not pursuing corruption cases. Read a CNN fact check about Trump\u2019s Ukraine claims. Democrats impeached Trump (the first of two times) for improperly dragging a foreign leader into US politics. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. But that bad experience did nothing to stop Trump or Republicans from making allegations about Hunter Biden. At the Republican presidential debate in 2020, Trump brought up Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and also alleged that he was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the Navy Reserve for cocaine use, which is not true. Hunter Biden was administratively discharged, which is standard procedure when an officer fails a drug test. Read a CNN fact check about the discharge claim. In fact, if you search \u201cHunter Biden\u201d in the CNN Facts First database, there are many results. Among them: Did Hunter Biden have a job before his father became vice president? Yes. Did Joe Biden profit from his son Hunter\u2019s career? There\u2019s no evidence. What is Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with China? He did business with Chinese partners. The sheer volume of these fact checks is worth noting as proof, if nothing else, that he is so frequently cited by his father\u2019s political opponents.  When Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives in January 2023, one of their high-profile moves was to launch an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, most of it built on trying to tie the president to his son\u2019s former business career. While House Republicans have referred Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden for criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading Congress, the impeachment inquiry has seemingly fallen apart without unanimous support from Republicans and no evidence of wrongdoing by the president. For Hunter Biden, his name is both a blessing and a curse. It was with help from his last name that he built a lucrative career as an attorney, then lobbyist, who then  did business with companies in Ukraine and China. It is because of his name that he has been so scrutinized. It is a trade-off Hunter Biden has been experiencing for years. When Joe Biden was tapped as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008, they made a point about not consorting with lobbyists. Hunter, then a lobbyist, ended his lucrative lobbying contracts a few months before the election that year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

At the hearing, Fagan was questioned about what specific steps she was taking to ensure those who commit serious misconduct, as well as those who cover up their crimes, are removed from the service. \u201cAre you aware that there are more survivors who leave the Coast Guard than perpetrators?\u201d asked Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is based. \u201cThis problem is not one of the past. It is real and present \u2026 and the evidence is not in my voice, it is the voices and faces of the whistleblowers \u2026 they are in my view heroes in this story.\u201d The hearing was sparked by CNN\u2019s reporting on the results of a secret investigation \u2014 dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which was quietly closed and hidden from Congress and the public despite substantiating dozens of sexual assaults that had previously been mishandled at the Coast Guard\u2019s prestigious academy. At a previous hearing led by the same subcommittee, four sexual assault victims testified about how they were silenced, retaliated against and left battling severe mental trauma while alleged perpetrators continued to thrive within the service. \u201cWe are taking action, the work is not done \u2026 we have not waited,\u201d Fagan said, repeatedly pledging to change the culture but saying she needs more time and resources to do so. \u201cI want to stop creating victims, but for the victims that we do have in the organization, I am 100% committed to fully supporting them and their needs.\u201d Fagan had previously said she only learned of the \u201ctotality\u201d of the so-called Fouled Anchor probe when CNN inquired about the issue, though she had heard of it because she had previously taken steps to remove a commanding officer caught up in the investigation. When pressed by senators Tuesday on how much she had known about the investigation prior to becoming commandant in 2021, she acknowledged that she had \u201cformally\u201d learned about it when the agency\u2019s leadership council was briefed in 2018,and she said that \u201cwhen we closed it out in 2020, there was conversation around whether to disclose or not.\u201d Fagan refused to say whether she believed her predecessor, Admiral Karl Schultz, was behind the ultimate decision to keep the findings of Fouled Anchor from Congress after the probe concluded. She said she did not have \u201cany direct evidence of misconduct\u201d surrounding this decision, even though minutes earlier senators had displayed a giant poster of a handwritten list made by Schultz\u2019s second in command with \u201cpros\u201d and \u201ccons\u201d about whether to be transparent with lawmakers and the public about the probe. Schultz previously declined to comment to CNN about Fouled Anchor. The hearing Tuesday came as Fagan was already facing immense pressure, as new controversies and increased congressional scrutiny have shined a light on how sexual assault is continuing to plague the agency. This includes explosive allegations from the academy\u2019s longtime head of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, who recently announced her resignation and said top leaders had directed her to lie to sexual assault victims and Congress, making her an unwitting accomplice in the Fouled Anchor coverup. Several lawmakers seized on Norenberg\u2019s allegations, specifically that she had been barred from providing survivors with key paperwork that would help them access veteran\u2019s benefits available to sexual assault survivors. Fagan said she couldn\u2019t speak about specifics of that allegation, as well as other issues raised by the senators, because of an open Inspector General investigation. That prompted Blumenthal to criticize her for using the investigation as a shield, eliciting applause from the audience. \u201cYou\u2019re the leader, these decisions are yours,\u201d said Blumenthal. Fagan said she hadn\u2019t actually read Norenberg\u2019s full statement, just the CNN article about it. Senators also focused on an email alleging a recent assault coverup that went viral after being deleted from Coast Guard servers and a leaked internal memo showing that Coast Guard officials recently worried that publishing testimonials from assault survivors \u201ccould continue to exacerbate the narrative \u2026 that the Coast Guard is in a sexual assault crisis now.\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, argued that the \u201creluctance\u201d to release the videos \u201cindicates a real failure of leadership\u201d and lack of understanding of the agency\u2019s current sexual assault problem. Throughout the hearing, lawmakers pressed Fagan on what they described as a lack of transparency and cooperation with their investigation. \u201cThe only way you can change the culture, the only way this can be fixed \u2026 is with truth, transparency and accountability,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin and Ranking Member of the subcommittee, adding that he thinks subpoenas will be necessary. Johnson flipped through page after page of records produced by the Coast Guard that were almost entirely redacted. A group of bipartisan lawmakers from the House Oversight committee, who were not part of the hearing but have their own investigation underway into the agency\u2019s handling of a variety of misconduct, including sexual assault, racism and hazing, joined the voices of criticism. They sent a letter to Fagan on Tuesday saying that the Coast Guard has provided fewer than 1% of records identified as potentially responsive to the requests to date. They also said they have heard from whistleblowers who \u201crevealed additional cultural deficiencies and alleged incompetence and misconduct by current and former leaders,\u201d who whistleblowers say may have \u201cwillfully concealed evidence relevant to criminal investigations\u201d and \u201cmisrepresented material facts to Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) investigators to conceal the depth of the culture of misconduct and the identities of other potential suspects.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Fagan said the Coast Guard has been fully cooperating with the subcommittee\u2019s investigation. But senators said it appeared that the records it deemed \u201csensitive\u201d and refused to provide were more likely withheld because of fear of further public embarrassment. \u201cWhat\u2019s required of the Coast Guard at this moment is an unsparing commitment to truth-telling, following the facts and the evidence wherever they lead, even if they are embarrassing to former members of the Coast Guard or present members,\u201d said Blumenthal.

In a preliminary injunction issued Tuesday, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives cannot enforce the rule intended to close the so-called gun show loophole in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Utah. The injunction also temporarily prevents enforcement of the federal rule against several gun rights groups and an individual gun owner in Texas who are also part of the lawsuit. Kacsmaryk, a Donald Trump-appointed conservative judge known for ruling against Biden administration policies, said in his 21-page ruling that the administration violated federal rulemaking procedures when it finalized the new rule earlier this year. The new ATF rule, which took effect May 20, seeks to close what gun control advocates have long called the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d by increasing\u00a0the requirements to obtain a federal firearms license. The more specifically define what it means to be \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of selling firearms. By making the term more definitive, the Justice Department has said it aims to better regulate the market and encourage higher compliance with the federal background check requirement. \u201cTexas has secured an injunction against Biden\u2019s unlawful ATF rule that would criminalize the private sale of guns.

The new block on the rule will last \u201cpending the resolution of this lawsuit,\u201d Kacsmaryk said in his ruling. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department\u00a0for comment.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_republican-majority-plans-tax-cuts", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republicans are looking for ways to advance their agenda next year if former President Donald Trump were to win back the presidency. Top of the list: a tax overhaul. In a meeting with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, Johnson highlighted using a procedural tool known as reconciliation to move ahead with the GOP agenda. Reconciliation allows the Senate to pass legislation with just a simple majority vote and has been used by both parties\u00a0in the past to advance changes to health care and tax policy among other issues. The GOP used the process under Trump to re-write the country\u2019s tax laws, many of which will expire at the end of next year. Republican Sen.\u00a0Thom\u00a0Tillis\u00a0of North Carolina\u00a0said that the roughly 30-minute discussion \u201clargely\u201d focused on potential changes to tax policy. \u201cWe were really talking more about future transactions, you know, the way that we\u2019ll go about tax reform, those sorts of things, if we get a good outcome in November, that was really the extent of it,\u201d Tillis told CNN, adding later that \u201cwhat we\u2019re talking about now is just getting everybody\u2019s expectations right on what you can do with reconciliation, what you can\u2019t do.\u201d But other senators argued that reconciliation could be used far beyond just tax changes. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told CNN\u00a0that\u00a0Republicans also brainstormed how they could address the border as well as other mandatory spending besides Medicare and Social Security. \u201cThe main idea is let\u2019s think big. Let\u2019s think bigger than just taxes,\u201d Cramer said. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas\u00a0echoed this sentiment. \u201cHe made clear they weren\u2019t giving up on trying to contain spending,\u201d Cornyn said of Johnson. \u201cI suggested to him that we need to look at more than just discretionary spending. We look at mandatory non-Social Security and non-Medicare, because both Biden and Trump have said they don\u2019t want to go there. But there\u2019s a bunch of money to be spent on mandatory spending that he said we ought to look at that, and then the tax code, as well.\u201d Cornyn said one of the goals of the meeting was to demonstrate a plan to hit the ground running if Republicans sweep in 2024. The conversation was an opportunity for Johnson and GOP senators to align themselves behind an agenda that the entire party could rally around and unite the GOP ahead of the election in November. Johnson left the Senate GOP lunch Wednesday \u201cencouraged,\u201d and laid out some of the potential priorities for the next Congress if Republicans make a sweep of the House, Senate and White House. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in fixing the great problems that have besieged this country,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of anticipation about what can be accomplished when we have unified government again.\u201d Johnson told reporters that there was a \u201clot of discussion\u201d around policy priorities they could pass under reconciliation and that he believes they need to be \u201caggressive.\u201d \u201cBut the Democrats have used reconciliation much more aggressively than the Republican party has in recent years. And so,\u00a0we\u2019re not going to make that mistake again. We have big policy changes that we\u2019d like to enact,\u201d he said. \u201cTo us these are important fixes,\u00a0and I think things that can be done early in the Congress.\u201d Specifically, Johnson indicated that they are focusing on major changes to tax policy if they have a unified government. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be regulatory reform, reducing the size and scope of government, and then with regard to other forward thinking, pro-growth policies, things that we can enact in a number of policy areas,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are looking at very creatively and, I think, deliberately.\u201d Not everyone, however, was sold on Johnson\u2019s message. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said the meeting surrounded Johnson\u2019s efforts to \u201csync up the house in the Senate to plan reconciliation bills going forward.\u201d He was \u201cvery skeptical\u201d leaving the meeting and said the chief focus should be on \u201cwinning.\u201d \u201cThe Trump tax cuts expire next year, and so, I\u2019m sure that if we have control of both chambers at the White House, we\u2019ll try to do that through reconciliation, as you\u2019d expect,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cNumber one, we better focus on winning the majority, because I\u2019ve heard this song and dance before.\u201d Cornyn said Johnson \u201cwanted to tell us that there have become some preliminary discussions about reconciliation, of course, all that\u2019s going to depend on whether we hit the trifecta or not.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better to plan now, and I think he\u2019s, you know, he\u2019s got a little bit more difficult job, trying to get 450 people you know, roughly moving in the same direction,\u201d Cornyn said. During his weekly news conference,\u00a0Senate\u00a0Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the elections in November will determine what Republicans are able to do in January. \u201cThe first step is we need to have a Republican president, a Republican House and a Republican Senate, or there will be no reconciliation at all,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt is an important tool. We hope to have an opportunity to use it and we\u2019ll find out the first Tuesday in\u00a0November.\u201d On a lighter note, Johnson also did a \u201cpretty convincing Trump imitation\u201d that provided some levity in his meeting with Senate Republicans that was otherwise bogged down by heavy policy subjects. Cornyn was asked if the presumptive GOP presidential candidate\u2019s name came up during the lunchtime meeting.\u00a0Cornyn replied, \u201cnot really\u201d before recalling that Johnson slipped into character at one point. \u201cHe mimicked Trump a little bit.\u00a0He\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0A pretty convincing Trump imitation,\u201d\u00a0Cornyn\u00a0told reporters after the meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Cornyn added.\u00a0\u201cAn impression is what I meant.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/republican-majority-plans-tax-cuts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
