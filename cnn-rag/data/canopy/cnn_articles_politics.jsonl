The Democratic National Committee said Friday it was launching 10 billboards across the city featuring Trump\u2019s comments. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign immediately began selling T-shirts and stickers with images of Wisconsin, with Milwaukee\u2019s location marked on them, and the words: \u201c(Not) a Horrible City.\u201d The party\u2019s top figures, meanwhile, took to social media to highlight the former president\u2019s remarks, which were reportedly made during a closed-door meeting Thursday with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Biden posted a photo showing him holding a Milwaukee Bucks jersey alongside team members who visited the White House after winning the NBA championship in 2021. \u201cI happen to love Milwaukee,\u201d Biden wrote. And Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, wrote on social media: \u201cAdd it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about,\u201d followed by a clown emoji. As Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues in his meeting with House Republicans on Thursday, the former president called Milwaukee \u201chorrible,\u201d according to a source in the room. The Trump campaign pushed back on the characterization of his remarks. \u201cHe never said it like how it\u2019s been falsely characterized as. He was talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are,\u201d campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Thursday on social media. The Democratic billboards feature Trump\u2019s comment as reported by Punchbowl News\u2019 Jake Sherman, who broke the news Thursday. Sherman posted on social media that Trump had said: \u201cMilwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\u201d The comment quickly gained traction in Wisconsin, a state that has been among the most competitive in presidential elections in recent years. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s banner headline Friday featured the remark. \u201cTrump: Milwaukee \u2018horrible,\u2019\u201d it read. Milwaukee is a Democratic stronghold \u2014 one that Trump and his allies have long cited, without evidence, as a city rife with election fraud. Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington \u2014 the so-called \u201cWOW counties\u201d \u2014 have long formed a red collar around the blue city. However, the suburban portions of those counties have mirrored national shifts during the Trump era, with Democrats making gains that have eaten into those counties\u2019 previously huge Republican margins. Trump is set to visit Racine, Wisconsin, for a campaign event next week, where he could address the reports about his closed-doors remarks about Milwaukee. Some Republican lawmakers who were present denied hearing Trump\u2019s comment. \u201cNo, that is not at all what I heard,\u201d Florida Rep. Cory Mills said Friday on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d He said multiple GOP members of Congress were present and did not agree with that account. \u201cNone of us heard that,\u201d Mills said, explaining that it was possible the word \u201chorrible\u201d was used in a different context. Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin, who was in the room Thursday, made clear to CNN that Trump was \u201cspecifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\u201d and not the city itself. Johnson, the Milwaukee mayor, told CNN that the city was pulling itself \u201cout of issues around crime that raged after the pandemic.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer, Melanie Zanona and Annie Grayer \u00a0contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/trump-milwaukee-horrible-democrats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_biden-campaign-senior-voters", "text": "Gussie Farris, 86, spends no time worrying about the ages of the oldest presidential candidates in American history. For those who do, this loyal supporter of President Joe Biden has sharp words about Donald Trump. \u201cBecause Trump is big and loud, he doesn\u2019t come off as old as maybe Biden does, but he\u2019s way less capable in the brain area,\u201d Farris said with a laugh, breaking a self-made rule about saying the former president\u2019s name aloud. Farris exemplifies a trend Biden\u2019s campaign is seeking to build on: strong performance among seniors \u2014 a group that polls show spends more time watching local and national news, thinks more about the 2024 election, and was alive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy. National and swing-state polls have shown Biden facing steep challenges winning over younger and non-White voters \u2014 constituencies that make up a key part of the Democratic coalition. But he\u2019s made gains among older voters, a group typically won handily by Republicans. It\u2019s a prized slice of the electorate, with high turnout rates and outsized sway in several key battleground states. Biden\u2019s campaign this week launched a new effort to court seniors \u2014 one it said will combine traditional organizing tactics like phone-banking and postcards with events like bingo nights and pickleball. His campaign touted endorsements from several groups focused on protecting Social Security, Medicare and pensions, and dispatched surrogates across the country to speak with senior groups. First lady Jill Biden, who traveled to Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Thursday as part of the initiative\u2019s launch, pushed back on criticism of her husband\u2019s age, which Trump and Republicans have sought to make a focal point of the 2024 race. \u201cJoe and that other guy are essentially the same age, let\u2019s not be fooled,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what this election is about, it\u2019s about the character of the person leading our country.\u201d Biden insisted that her husband is \u201ca healthy, wise 81-year-old, ready and willing to work for you every day to make our future better.\u201d \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d she said. As Trump turns 78 on Friday \u2014 just three years younger than Biden\u2019s 81 \u2014 age is an unmistakable part of the bitterly contested race for the White House. But the Biden campaign is suddenly embracing age in a different way by turning to seniors like Farris to build a critical piece of his coalition. \u201cI have people that come up to me because they know I\u2019m a Democrat and say, \u2018What can I do? I have to do something, find me something to do.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that happen before,\u201d said Farris, a retired school counselor. \u201cThey don\u2019t want Trump. They don\u2019t want him to be the president. And I think they\u2019re scared. They\u2019re worried about our democracy and what he would do.\u201d Grand Rapids and surrounding Kent County\u00a0serve as\u00a0a bellwether within the broader battleground of Michigan. Biden won here by 6 points in 2020, contributing to his statewide victory, after Trump narrowly carried\u00a0both\u00a0the\u00a0county and state four years earlier \u201cWe could determine who sits in the White House. It\u2019s a swing state. We have to retain that it\u2019s blue,\u201d said Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who became politically awakened and engaged after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen.\u201d Biden is working to become the first Democratic presidential candidate in nearly a quarter century to win voters 65 and older. Since Al Gore narrowly carried the senior vote in 2000, Republican candidates have consistently won the senior vote. In 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country. \u201cI think baby boomers are doing the heavy lifting of the work right now,\u201d said Kim Gates, chairwoman of the Kent County Democratic Party, who also became active in politics after the 2016 election. \u201cThey\u2019re at a point in their life where they\u2019ve seen how politics has changed and recognize that it\u2019s a priority for them.\u201d As other parts of the Biden coalition are fraying, the campaign is putting a renewed focus on seniors to volunteer and vote. Yet a sense of deep disappointment weighs heavy on Grand Rapids retiree Barbara Howard, 70, who voted for Biden four years ago but won\u2019t this time. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not going to vote for president,\u201d said Howard, a supporter of Palestinian rights who calls Biden\u2019s backing of Israel a betrayal. \u201cI just feel like I need to make a statement that this is unacceptable. Where are we are at in this country? It doesn\u2019t really matter if it\u2019s Biden or Trump.\u201d Judy and Nick Herrick, both 80 and retired, say the president\u2019s steady hand and commitment to protecting democracy inspires them to volunteer for Biden\u2019s reelection. They often canvass and register younger voters in Grand Rapids. \u201cWhat do they say, 80 is the new 60?\u201d Judy Herrick said with a laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting for me is the opportunity for seniors to talk with young folks \u2026 if you\u2019re in your 20s, or the 30s, what impact is having a president like Trump with you?\u201d Nick Herrick is quick to defend the president\u2019s age to anyone who asks. \u201cHe\u2019s one year older than me. And when we get done here \u2026 I\u2019m going to go home and water ski,\u201d Herrick said. \u201cAge is sort of a thing in the mind, and I look at his thinking and his approach to things looks pretty good to me, especially when you view it in contrast to what the alternative is.\u201d That contrast with Trump is what the Biden campaign is investing millions on television ads targeting some favorite programs of seniors, including \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and the local news. \u201cThe senior generation, values and character are important to us,\u201d Farris said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they could vote someone like, like Trump with no sense of morals or character or ethics, or, you know, the kind of tradition that most seniors have.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/biden-campaign-senior-voters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_election-age-what-matters", "text": "A truism of American politics is that older voters prefer the Republican and younger voters prefer the Democrat. That\u2019s what happened in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won voters under 50 and Republican Donald Trump won voters over 50, according to exit polls. Biden\u2019s margin among younger voters \u2014 he got 65% of voters ages 18-24 \u2014 helped him overcome the fact that Trump got 52% of older voters, who accounted for more than half the electorate. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College even though she got more votes than him, but the pattern of younger voters supporting the Democrat held. Clinton got more votes among voters ages 18-44, and Trump got more votes among voters ages 45 and older, according to exit polls. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney lost the election, but he did better than Democrat Barack Obama among voters 45 and older. Voters under 30 haven\u2019t preferred the Republican since 1988, when George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in a landslide. Voters over the age of 65 haven\u2019t preferred the Democrat since 2000, when Al Gore lost the election despite getting more votes than Republican George W. Bush. But the old rules don\u2019t seem to apply in this year\u2019s presidential election, where both candidates are old men and their fitness to serve is a top issue. Older voters are gravitating to Biden, and younger voters are taking a look at Trump. A new Marist poll in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, for instance, showed a tight race overall with Trump at 47% and Biden at 45%, a within-the-margin-of-error difference. Trump is making inroads with voters of color and is nearly even with Biden among voters under 45 in that poll. But older voters have gone in the opposite direction, and instead of favoring Trump, are nearly split in the Marist poll. It\u2019s a trend that extends to other states. In a nationwide Quinnipiac University poll released in May, Biden and Trump split younger voters, but Biden has an edge among voters 65 and older. Not\u00a0every poll shows the same\u00a0level of shift,\u00a0but\u00a0the general movement among both younger and older voters is\u00a0a departure from past results. Biden is now leaning into questions about his age that have dogged his reelection campaign and worry voters in opinion polls. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d first lady Jill Biden said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin this week, part of a three-day swing designed to boost his support among older voters. Older voters are essentially Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s peers. Both men were born in the 1940s. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Eric Bradner note that older voters were \u201calive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy.\u201d They also write that \u201cin 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country.\u201d In Michigan, Zeleny and Bradner talked to Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who only got active in politics after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen,\u201d she said. Despite the shift of older voters in the direction of Biden (and younger voters away from him), I was surprised to see older voters still have reservations about Biden\u2019s age. In a February New York Times/Siena College poll, nearly three-quarters of registered voters ages 65 and older said Biden was too old to be effective as president compared with less than half who said the same about Trump. Those figures tracked with the population at large. CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein noted last year that older voters were more likely to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance and argued that some of his policy wins, like pushing for lowering drug costs in Medicare, appeal directly to seniors. Whatever the reason, if Biden is to overcome questions about his age to keep his job, it will be with help from people his own age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/election-age-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_coast-guard-investigation-what-matters", "text": "It was nearly a year ago that CNN first reported about a cover-up at the Coast Guard Academy. That initial report about how the academy kept secret its own review of decades of sexual assault cover-ups continues to reverberate. This week, the Coast Guard Academy official in charge of sexual assault prevention, Shannon Norenberg, resigned in protest and said the Coast Guard had made her an unwitting accomplice to a cover-up. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable,\u201d Norenberg said in a statement. Watch her appearance on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d. Separately, the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is scheduled to testify about the scandal on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where she will face tough questioning about why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. How does investigative reporting like this come to be? It took a team of\u00a0journalists\u00a0from CNN Investigates,\u00a0including Melanie Hicken,\u00a0Blake Ellis, Audrey Ash, Curt Devine and Pamela Brown. I emailed with Hicken and Ellis, reporters who have been working on this story since the beginning. Our conversation is below. WOLF: You\u2019ve been covering this Coast Guard story for some time. What was the first thread you pulled on it, and how has it unraveled? HICKEN and ELLIS: Our Coast Guard reporting all started with a young woman named Hope Hicks who was a student at a different service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy. In an anonymous blog post, she wrote about how she had been raped by her boss while out at sea \u2013 prompting a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry. As we started digging into her case, we became fascinated by this little-known industry.\u00a0We\u00a0spent months talking to merchant mariners who were assaulted while working on commercial ships and learned more about how the justice process works in the commercial shipping world \u2013\u00a0ultimately discovering that a number of sexual assaults were going unpunished and that it was all happening under the Coast Guard\u2019s watch.\u00a0So, that was the turning point where we started turning our attention to the Coast Guard. It is only because of this initial reporting on the Coast Guard and the maritime industry that we were able to ultimately break the news of the Fouled Anchor scandal. It took months to develop the trust of sources, obtain key records\u00a0and conduct sensitive interviews with victims. WOLF: A key part of the story is Operation Fouled Anchor, the secret internal probe of cover-ups. Has the Coast Guard acknowledged a cover-up?\u00a0 HICKEN and ELLIS: Reporting on this story has been so interesting because Fouled Anchor essentially ended up being a cover-up of past cover-ups.\u00a0The internal probe substantiated years of sexual assault at the US Coast Guard Academy and revealed how victims\u2019 complaints were ignored and, at times, covered up \u2013 allowing some offenders to rise to high-level positions in the Coast Guard and other military branches. Through our reporting, we learned that while there were originally plans to come clean to Congress about the reporting and its damning findings, Coast Guard leaders ultimately chose to bury it \u2013 even going so far as to make a list of pros and cons of disclosure. The Coast Guard\u2019s current leader has apologized to the workforce and Congress but has been careful to avoid calling the suppression of the Fouled Anchor investigation a cover-up. WOLF: Has there been any follow-up to look at some of those assaults from years ago? HICKEN and ELLIS: Operation Fouled Anchor itself was launched in 2014 to look at those earlier assaults when an academy graduate claimed that her allegations of rape from years earlier had never been investigated and her attacker had gone on to become a top officer in the Air Force. Despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, Fouled Anchor investigators found that most of the alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated at the time. Even after the cases were reopened during Fouled Anchor however, few alleged perpetrators were held accountable. The assailant in the case that started Fouled Anchor was the only person to face criminal charges in military court as a result of the probe, but an appeals court ended up ruling in his favor and dismissing the charges, saying that the military had missed its window to prosecute because the Coast Guard waited nearly two decades to investigate the victim\u2019s allegations. We learned that two other accused perpetrators were discreetly pushed to retire from the Coast Guard, but that there were nearly 40 cases where the Coast Guard no longer had jurisdiction over the alleged attackers and local and federal criminal statutes had long run out of time, so no action was taken at all. In terms of what is happening now, we know that the Coast Guard is currently investigating an officer for sexually harassing and groping a cadet who reported him to the academy two decades earlier\u00a0at the Coast Guard Academy (the officer\u2019s attorney denies the allegations). The former cadet brought up the allegations during\u00a0testimony\u00a0at a congressional hearing last year, but the Coast Guard didn\u2019t launch the criminal investigation until months later, after the woman said she flagged his name on a promotion list to senators. Another woman has asked Congress to reopen her rape case from 2005, which the Coast Guard has claimed it cannot pursue despite findings at the time that he had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her since he is not currently under Coast Guard jurisdiction. WOLF: There\u2019s a hearing in Congress this week. Shannon Norenberg resigned in protest. Has there been any accountability yet at the Coast Guard Academy or in the Coast Guard? HICKEN and ELLIS: It sounds like the Coast Guard\u2019s current leader, Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan, will be facing a lot of tough questions at the hearing. So far, she has wanted the agency to focus on the future and make changes to policies that she hopes will help prevent sexual assault and better support survivors. But many Coast Guard members are frustrated by two major issues: that to date, the leaders who covered up Operation Fouled Anchor still haven\u2019t been held accountable and that Fagan is not acknowledging how much of an issue sexual assault still is in the service today. Shannon Norenberg was angry that she was used as part of what she described as a \u201ccruel coverup\u201d where victims and Congress were both deceived, but she is also frustrated that more hasn\u2019t changed at the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 saying perpetrators are still facing little accountability. WOLF: Having covered this for so long, what is it about the Coast Guard Academy that allowed this kind of cover-up culture to develop? Is this a problem specific to the Coast Guard or the academy? HICKEN and ELLIS: Many of the issues we have seen playing out at the Coast Guard Academy and Coast Guard at large, such as fear of retaliation for speaking out about assaults, a lack of accountability for alleged perpetrators and a boys-club culture, were very similar to what we heard from those in the US Merchant Marine Academy community when we first started this reporting several years ago. We have also heard from assault survivors from across the military service who argue that our country still has a long way to go in combating military sexual assault and attempting to make survivors whole. We have also been told by some in the organization that because the Coast Guard does not fall under the Department of Defense, like the other military branches, that it has historically escaped the same level of scrutiny. Many are hopeful that maybe that can change with people who have been terrified to speak up finally feeling like they can. WOLF: You include your email addresses at the end of your stories and ask for tips to investigate. Does that ever turn into stories? HICKEN and ELLIS: Yes! We have received so much helpful information through tips in response to our stories, and many of the sexual assault survivors we have spoken with throughout our reporting originally contacted us through our tips email (watchdog@cnn.com). Many current and former Coast Guard employees have also shared information with us anonymously that has hugely informed our reporting and led to multiple follow-up stories. We\u2019re always looking for new story ideas, and a variety of our past investigations have stemmed from tips from readers, so we welcome emails!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/coast-guard-investigation-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_supreme-court-bump-stocks", "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a federal ban on bump stocks approved by former President Donald Trump, the latest opinion from the conservative court rolling back firearm regulations. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion for a 6-3 court. The court\u2019s liberal wing, led by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented. Trump had pushed for the ban in response to a 2017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi-automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute. \u201cA bump stock does not convert a semiautomatic rifle into a machinegun any more than a shooter with a lightning-fast trigger finger does,\u201d Thomas wrote in his opinion. \u201cEven with a bump stock, a semiautomatic rifle will fire only one shot for every \u2018function of the trigger.\u2019\u201d The ban was challenged by a Texas gun store owner, Michael Cargill, who purchased two of the devices in 2018, turned them over to the government after the prohibition was implemented and then promptly sued to get them back. The federal rule made possession of a bump stock a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Though the case didn\u2019t rely on the Second Amendment, it did put the debate about guns back on the court\u2019s docket in one of the most closely watched controversies this year. In that sense, the decision was the latest from the high court to side with gun rights groups. President Joe Biden said in a statement later Friday that the ruling \u201cstrikes down an important gun safety regulation.\u00a0Americans should not have to live in fear of this mass devastation.\u201d Sotomayor reads dissent from the bench Sotomayor wrote in a scathing dissent joined by the court\u2019s other two liberal justices that the majority\u2019s ruling \u201cwill have deadly consequences.\u201d The decision, she wrote, \u201chamstrings the Government\u2019s efforts to keep machineguns from gunmen like the Las Vegas shooter.\u201d In a move that underscored Sotomayor\u2019s discontent with the court\u2019s ruling, the justice took the rare step of reading her dissent from the bench on Friday. \u201cWhen I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \u201cA bump-stock-equipped semiautomatic rifle fires \u2018automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u2019 Because I, like Congress, call that a machinegun, I respectfully dissent.\u201d Gun control groups decry \u2018shameful decision\u2019 A number of gun control advocacy groups argued Friday that the court\u2019s ruling will have a dangerous impact in a country constantly reeling from gun violence. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen bump stocks cause immense destruction and violence,\u201d\u00a0said Esther Sanchez-Gomez, an attorney with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cCongress must act to undo the damage and make clear that bump stocks, and all automatic conversion devices, are illegal under federal law.\u201d The pro-gun safety group Brady United similarly denounced the ruling, saying in a statement on X: \u201cBump stocks essentially turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. Weapons of war should have no place in our communities.\u201d And Everytown for Gun Safety argued that the high court \u201chas put countless lives in danger.\u201d The group said in a statement that lawmakers in Washington \u201ccan and should right this deadly wrong.\u201d Groups that opposed the ban argued that the federal government never had the power to ban the devices without Congress\u2019s approval. Randy Kozuch, the head of the National Rifle Association\u2019s legislative arm, said on Friday that the court \u201chas properly restrained executive branch agencies to their role of enforcing, and not making, the law.\u201d Mark Chenoweth, president of the New Civil Liberties Alliance, the group that represented Cargill, also applauded the decision. \u201cThe statute Congress passed did not ban bump stocks, and ATF does not have the power to do so on its own,\u201d Chenoweth said. \u201cThis result is completely consistent with the Constitution\u2019s assignment of all legislative power to Congress. Bump-stock opponents should direct any views at Congress, not the Court, which faithfully applied the statute in front of it.\u201d From Capone to the Supreme Court The bump stock challenge was tied indirectly to a gun control law Congress enacted in the 1930s that was intended to target gangsters like Al Capone and John Dillinger. Responding to grisly crimes in which machine guns were used to rob banks or ambush police, lawmakers required owners to register those weapons. The law was amended several times and, by 1986, it prohibited Americans from transferring or possessing a machine gun altogether in most circumstances. Importantly, the amended law defined \u201cmachine gun\u201d as a weapon that fires more than one round with \u201ca single function of the trigger.\u201d What, precisely, that phrase meant was the focus of the appeal. Both the Trump and Biden administrations, as well as gun control groups, said the way bump stocks work mean they qualify as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reclassified the devices as machine guns in 2018 and, based on the earlier law, barred people from buying or owning them. Trump described bump stocks at the time as converting \u201clegal weapons into illegal machines.\u201d ATF estimated that as many as 520,000 bump stocks were sold between 2010 and 2018. The device replaces a semiautomatic rifle\u2019s regular stock, the part of a gun that rests against the shoulder. It lets shooters use the recoil of the weapon to mimic automatic firing if they hold their trigger finger in place. Opponents say the ATF overstepped its authority with the reclassification. They noted that the agency under both Democratic and Republican administrations had long said the devices were not covered by the law. A US District Court in Texas and a panel of three judges on the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Justice Department. But the full 5th Circuit reconsidered the case and issued a fractured opinion last year siding with Cargill. The court appeared split during oral arguments in late February. Several of the court\u2019s conservatives were concerned, in particular, with the idea that Americans who purchased bump stocks when they were not classified as machine guns could suddenly be prosecuted for a crime they were not aware of. Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried that the criminalization of the device would \u201censnare\u201d Americans. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not aware of the legal prohibition, you can be convicted,\u201d Kavanaugh told the attorney representing the Biden administration. \u201cThat\u2019s going to ensnare a lot of people who are not aware of the legal prohibition.\u201d Another central theme of the arguments was the question of whether Congress \u2014 rather than the ATF \u2014 should have approved the ban. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s emerged as a central theme at the Supreme Court in recent years, with groups challenging financial and environmental regulations in separate cases. The court, meanwhile, has repeatedly sided with some of the same gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, that opposed the bump stock ban. Most recently, the court\u2019s conservative majority invalidated a New York state law that required state residents to have a special need to carry a weapon outside of their homes. Thomas includes graphics of how bump stocks work In an opinion that reflected the technical nature of the case and the oral arguments in February, Thomas\u2019 opinion digs deeply into the mechanics of semi-automatic rifles \u2013 including with a series of graphics demonstrating what happens when triggers are depressed. \u201cFiring multiple shots using a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock requires more than a single function of the trigger,\u201d Thomas wrote, underscoring the idea that the devices are not the same thing as an automatic weapon where a shooter simply holds down a trigger. \u201cToo much forward pressure and the rifle will not slide back far enough to release and reset the trigger, preventing the rifle from firing another shot. Too little pressure and the trigger will not bump the shooter\u2019s trigger finger with sufficient force to fire another shot,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cWithout this ongoing manual input, a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock will not fire multiple shots. Thus, firing multiple shots requires engaging the trigger one time \u2014 and then some.\u201d GOP lawmakers celebrate court\u2019s ruling The overwhelming majority of House Republicans celebrated the court\u2019s decision on Friday, arguing that they long believed it was unconstitutional. Despite the fact the action was taken under the Trump administration, many Republicans argued it was the wrong move at the time. \u201cIt vindicates the rights of gun owners,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz told CNN. \u201cI think there was a lot of misinformation about bump stocks. I think responsible gun ownership enhances safety.\u201d Texas Rep. Chip Roy also praised the ruling, saying the ban \u201cwas a bad rule, just like the pistol brace is a Biden-era rule, which is a bad rule.\u201d \u201cThere are definitional issues on the trigger,\u201d Roy added. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had a really strong case in the first place. Obviously, it\u2019s a strong statement and in still continuing to protect, support Second Amendment rights \u2014 so I\u2019m glad the court did it.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/supreme-court-bump-stocks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_social-security-medicare-election-what-matters", "text": "Unlike most Republicans who have been critical of former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Paul Ryan is not about to make an endorsement or even indicate he\u2019ll grudgingly vote for Trump. Arguing Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d for office, Ryan, a Republican who represented the battleground state of Wisconsin in Congress, said on Fox News this week that he\u2019ll write in some other Republican \u2013 a conservative rather than a populist like Trump. It was a notable moment, particularly since it occurred on Fox News, where opposition to Trump is hard to come by. Ryan, who has turned to a lucrative career on Wall Street since leaving politics, remains on the board of the conservative network\u2019s parent company. \u201cI would prefer a party that is based on principles, not personality or populism,\u201d Ryan said, describing himself as \u201can anti-establishment Republican at this time.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning turn for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, to be so out of whack with his party. Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who selected Ryan as his running mate, is also now effectively a member of the shrinking Republican resistance to Trump. A promise to do nothing Like many Americans, Ryan said he isn\u2019t happy with either of the major-party candidates, but he has a very specific reason for concern. It\u2019s worth taking a closer look at his important point. \u201cThey\u2019re both promising not to tackle the debt,\u201d Ryan said, coming back to the issue that has animated his political career. \u201cAll the First World countries have the same issue we have: baby boomers retiring and unfunded entitlements coming due, and massive amount of debt,\u201d he said, referring to Social Security and Medicare, on which millions of aging Americans rely for their quality of life but which also eat up a growing portion of federal spending. For the record, both President Joe Biden and Trump have sworn they will not cut benefits. When Trump suggested in an interview in March that he might be open to Medicare and Social Security cuts, his campaign quickly made clear that no, he was talking about waste, not touching the programs themselves. He attacked other Republicans during the primary for being open to reforming these programs. $34 trillion and counting The current US national debt exceeds $34 trillion, a figure that has exploded under both parties. Pandemic-era spending had bipartisan support. Republicans passed massive tax cuts under Trump. Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act under Biden and the Affordable Care Act under then-President Barack Obama. Ryan is absolutely correct that neither side, at least at the presidential level, is making action on the debt a political priority. \u201cYou can fix it if you have the political will,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the political will right now. We don\u2019t have serious politics right now.\u201d Whether and exactly how concerned to be with that debt is a matter of intense debate among policy wonks and economists, but the idea that the US is on an unsustainable path is generally accepted. More focus on tax cuts Meanwhile, in the larger political conversation, there\u2019s more focus on how or whether to extend Trump-era tax cuts that will expire next year. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby has a look at the opposing promises from Biden and Trump. Trump wants to extend all of the tax cuts, which could further explode the debt without corresponding spending cuts. Biden, on the other hand, wants to allow the cuts to expire only for those making $400,000 and up. He would also try raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. When Trump and Republicans enacted the current tax structure, they made individual tax cuts temporary and most of the corporate tax cuts permanent. Democrats are also hoping to use the tax debate as leverage to increase social safety net spending. More from Luhby: Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced\u00a0child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous\u00a0Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the\u00a0American Rescue Plan Act\u00a0that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. Her story \u2013 read it here \u2013 outlines more of the looming tax implications and spells out the argument that the Trump tax cuts were a huge success alongside the opposing argument that they were a total failure. What\u2019s not up for debate is that the debt has grown, by trillions of dollars, under both Trump and Biden. Fearing \u2018radical budget surgery\u2019 Ryan fears a future when the Treasury Department can no longer sell the interest-bearing bonds that fund deficit spending, at which point the government would essentially have to print money to cover expenses. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a dollar crisis. That\u2019s when the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency is called into question. That\u2019s a huge privilege we could lose,\u201d he said, arguing it would lead to \u201cradical budget surgery\u201d \u2013 steep, painful cuts \u2013 to get out of the crisis. Solve the problem now or solve the problem later, he is arguing, but solving it now will be less painful. Tough choices could come sooner than you think Social Security won\u2019t be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035 unless Congress acts, according to a government forecast. Spending on the program will balloon, and the trust funds that currently fund it will run dry. At that point, the payroll tax and other income sources that fund Social Security will only be able to pay 83% of benefits. Congress will be forced to do something. It\u2019s a similar story with a slightly different timeline for Medicare. \u201cIf you step ahead of this problem, you can solve the insolvency of these entitlement programs without affecting anyone\u2019s benefits who are on them today,\u201d Ryan said. The broad strokes of what needs to be done are generally known and have been suggested by a variety of commissions, foundations and economic policy groups. The fixes could include incrementally raising the retirement age over the coming years and changing the funding structure for the systems to raise more money. Biden has proposed additional taxes on those making more than $400,000 to address Medicare\u2019s solvency, among other ideas, but does not have a detailed Social Security plan. Ryan has previously endorsed reform Ryan, to his credit, proposed some of the more revolutionary changes earlier in his career. When House Republicans passed versions of those plans, he paid a political price. They arguably contributed to his and Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. \u201cThe problem is, doing what I just said, you lay yourself out there for ridicule,\u201d Ryan said on Fox. \u201cYou lay yourself out there for political shots.\u201d He added: \u201cInvariably, the political demagoguery makes it look like you\u2019re taking something away from people. The dirty little secret in all of this is, Medicare and Social Security are going insolvent on their own. That means they go bankrupt. That means current seniors do get their benefits cut if we do nothing.\u201d But Ryan also deserves some blame He was House speaker, for instance, when Republicans passed those Trump tax cuts in 2017, which cut government income without addressing spending. Ryan suggested a fix to the problem now could be a commission set up to create a path to solvency and which would be able to force a vote in Congress. There are previous examples of such commissions, such as the one helmed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1983. Ryan actually sat on another one during the Obama administration. Chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, it was called the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and it sought a bipartisan menu of tough choices to deal with the unsustainable path it has been clear the US has been on for a long time. When it came time to endorse those proposals, however, Ryan voted no, helping kill the commission.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/social-security-medicare-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_chris-murphy-supreme-court-bump-stocks", "text": "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said Sunday the Supreme Court is \u201creadying\u00a0to fundamentally rewrite the Second Amendment\u201d after striking down a federal ban on bump stocks. Recent gun-related rulings from the high court, Murphy told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d signal it is prepared to \u201ctake away permanently the ability of Congress to do simple things like require people to go through a background check or move forward on taking dangerous weapons like AR-15s off of the streets.\u201d \u201cSo I think this court is poised to make it very hard for Congress or state legislatures to be able to regulate guns and keep our communities and schools safe,\u201d he said. The Supreme Court\u2019s striking down of the federal ban on bump stocks marked the latest opinion from the conservative bench rolling back firearm regulations. Former President Donald Trump had pushed for the ban in response to a\u00a02017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. But it was successfully challenged by a Texas gun store owner who purchased two of the devices in 2018 and turned them over to the government after the prohibition before suing to get them back. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute. \u201cThis is a Republican administration that banned bump stocks. At the time, Republicans in the Senate and the House were supportive of it,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said Sunday. \u201cBut now that they have got a Supreme Court that seems ready to unwind the entirety of the Second Amendment and take away from Congress or the executive branch the ability to keep our communities safe, they\u2019re once again lining up behind the gun industry.\u201d Murphy\u2019s comments echo the response of gun control advocacy groups, which argued Friday that the court\u2019s ruling will have a dangerous impact in a country constantly reeling from gun violence. The overwhelming majority of Republicans, however, celebrated the court\u2019s decision, arguing that they long believed the ban on bump stocks was unconstitutional. While the action was taken under the Trump administration, many Republicans argued it was the wrong move at the time. GOP Sen. Tom Cotton told Tapper in a separate interview Sunday that the bump stock ban \u201ctreads close\u201d to an infringement of the Second Amendment. \u201cI would suggest before we infringe on the rights of law-abiding American citizens, we should crack down on violent crime and gang crimes,\u201d\u00a0he said. Though the case didn\u2019t rely on the Second Amendment, it did put the debate about guns back on the court\u2019s docket in one of the most closely watched controversies this year. In that sense, the decision was the latest from the high court to side with gun rights groups. Still, Murphy \u2013 who has made gun safety legislation his life\u2019s work following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut \u2013 said \u201cthere is good news to celebrate today,\u201d pointing to dropping urban gun homicide rates. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do to make sure that something like Sandy Hook never happens again, that every kid gets the chance to graduate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have some reason to believe that this country is starting to turn the corner and change our laws in a way that makes our kids and our families safer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/chris-murphy-supreme-court-bump-stocks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_abortion-judge-matthew-kacsmaryk-supreme-court-mifepristone", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week rebuffing an effort to restrict access to mifepristone is unlikely to be the final word on the abortion pill \u2013 and the next person to speak will almost certainly be a Trump-appointed judge in Texas at the center of the controversy. US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk will have to decide later this summer if three conservative states that want to continue the fight against the drug can do so in his court. The decision is one of several in coming weeks that will determine whether \u2013 and if so, how quickly \u2013 the case against mifepristone makes it back to the Supreme Court. Kacsmaryk, a Donald Trump appointee who previously worked for a Christian legal advocacy group, drew national attention last year by invalidating the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, a sweeping decision that would have removed the drug from the market entirely. Now, both sides in the abortion debate are gearing up for the case to return to his Amarillo courtroom. \u201cThis fight isn\u2019t over,\u201d said Carrie Flaxman, a senior legal advisor at Democracy Forward who has long represented reproductive rights groups. \u201cAccess to this medication very much remains at risk.\u201d A unanimous Supreme Court on Thursday swatted away the current challenge to mifepristone access without reaching the merits of the case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, wrote that the anti-abortion doctors and groups that sued over the drug didn\u2019t have standing because they were not injured by its use. But the court\u2019s decision left open the possibility that some other entity might be positioned to challenge the steps the Food and Drug Administration took in 2016 and 2021 to loosen certain limits on the drug. Those actions included allowing mifepristone to be mailed to patients without a doctor\u2019s visit and allowing it to be used longer in a pregnancy. \u201cIt is not clear that no one else would have standing to challenge FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. By spiking the claims on procedural grounds, the high court avoided weighing in on the merits of the anti-abortion advocates\u2019 arguments about how the pill has been regulated. If opponents of the abortion pill can overcome the procedural hurdles to get the justices to consider the substance of their case, they may find some sympathy with the conservative majority that just two years ago overturned Roe v. Wade. Where Biden\u2019s policies go to die Even before the Supreme Court decided the case, three conservative states \u2013 Missouri, Idaho and Kansas \u2013 had sought to intervene to challenge the drug alongside the doctors and anti-abortion groups. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said he is \u201cmoving forward undeterred\u201d with his effort to pursue the case in Texas. An immediate question for Kacsmaryk is whether the states can continue to do so in his court. Generally, parties must be able to justify filing lawsuits in a specific federal court. The doctors and anti-abortion groups who sued over mifepristone incorporated a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine in Amarillo\u00a0 months before their lawsuit. The groups\u2019 move to bring the case in Amarillo, a far-flung court division in Texas\u2019 panhandle, was among the most controversial aspects of the lawsuit. Kacsmaryk is virtually guaranteed to hear every case that is filed there, and his courthouse has become a favorite option for conservative litigants and states seeking to halt the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. On the bench, Kacsmaryk has handed down a series of rulings killing policies from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. He has ruled against the administration\u2019s attempt to end the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, for instance, and rejected its effort to use a provision of Obamacare to protect gay and transgender healthcare workers from discrimination. Earlier this month, Kacsmaryk blocked the Biden administration from enforcing in four states a federal rule that requires\u202fpeople who sell firearms online and at gun shows to conduct background checks on their potential customers. In the mifepristone case, Kacsmaryk\u2019s initial ruling was notable not just for its sweeping nature but in how he embraced the anti-abortion movement\u2019s sensational rhetoric about the procedure. Kacsmaryk\u2019s decision on mifepristone was later narrowed by a federal appeals court to deal only with the subsequent steps the FDA took to make mifepristone easier to obtain. As the administration\u2019s appeal of Kacsmaryk\u2019s abortion ruling played out at the Supreme Court, the trial judge granted the three states\u2019 bid to intervene in the legal challenge in his court. With the Supreme Court now ruling that the underlying litigation must be tossed because the doctors and groups don\u2019t have standing to sue, it\u2019s not clear that Missouri would be able to continue its lawsuit in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court in Texas. \u201cThis lawsuit should not be permitted to continue in Amarillo, because now that the Supreme Court has found that the original plaintiffs lacked standing, that means the case was defective from the start,\u201d Julia Kaye, senior staff attorney for the ACLU, said. The groups fighting mifepristone argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision shouldn\u2019t affect the states\u2019 ability to sue. The \u201cruling does not impact the states below,\u201d said Erin Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative group that represented the doctors at the Supreme Court. \u201cI would expect the litigation to continue with those states raising different standing arguments than made by our doctors.\u201d Aides to the attorneys general in Missouri, Idaho and Kansas did not respond to a request for comment. If Kacsmaryk decides that those states cannot continue their lawsuit in his courthouse in Texas, those attorneys general \u2013 and perhaps Republican leaders of other states \u2013 may look for a friendly courthouse elsewhere to file a similar challenge. However, in most federal courthouses in other states, their lawsuit would be randomly assigned to one of multiple judges \u2013 not all of whom would be stalwart conservatives. States may also lose on standing In the mifepristone case, the anti-abortion doctors who sued claimed that they faced the risk of being forced to treat patients dealing with complications from the drug, such as heavier-than-expected bleeding. Triaging those women, they said, had a substantial impact on their practices. Both the FDA and several medical groups, including the American Medical Association, told the Supreme Court that mifepristone is safe. Some said they had been called on to perform post-medication abortion procedures they said violated their beliefs. But the Supreme Court knocked that argument aside, noting that federal law already allows doctors to avoid performing procedures that violate their conscience. The states make a different argument on standing: That state-run hospitals and insurance programs have to pay the cost for adverse effects from the drug. Those kind of claims are heavily debated but even bank shot efforts by states to challenge federal action have sometimes found a receptive audience at the Supreme Court. Last term, a 6-3 majority shot down Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program. To do so, the court determined that Missouri could establish standing because a quasi-government loan servicing entity would lose out on an estimated $44 million in fees from loans that would have been forgiven under the plan. Adam Unikowsky, a veteran Supreme Court litigator who has closely followed the mifepristone case, predicted it will be hard for the states to get the issue back before the Supreme Court. Even if they can keep the current case going in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court \u2013 a tall order \u2013 states will have to convince lower courts that they were injured by the expanded access to mifepristone. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week doesn\u2019t explicitly foreclose that possibility, Unikowsky said, but it also did not make the path any easier. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving the door barely ajar for someone else to give it a shot,\u201d he said. But Unikowsky said he believes the states\u2019 claim \u201cis still weak on standing.\u201d Jaime Santos, co-chair of the appellate and Supreme Court litigation practice at the law firm Goodwin, predicted that the states are \u201cgoing to have a very hard time \u2013 and probably an impossible time\u201d continuing the case against the FDA\u2019s actions.

His conviction in Delaware, the first federal criminal trial of a president\u2019s son in US history, is for allegedly lying on a federal firearms background check and owning a firearm for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs and could land him behind bars. It has put a personal drama of addiction and betrayal in the public eye, an unwanted embarrassment for the Biden family. Read more from CNN\u2019s team covering the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, his brother\u2019s widow \u2013 with whom he had an affair \u2013 and his daughter all testified. Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction will also serve as a sort of foil for former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction for lying on business records in New York. That\u2019s not to equate the two sets of charges or the trials. Trump was convicted for hiding his compensation of hush money paid to keep an alleged affair out of the media during the 2016 presidential campaign. He is also running again in the 2024 presidential election, while Hunter Biden is now an artist. Hunter Biden also faces tax evasion charges in Los Angeles later this year, another case brought by the former Trump-appointed US attorney turned special counsel whose planned plea deal with Biden to settle both the gun and tax problems imploded last year when a Trump-appointed judge refused to accept it. Trump feared a Joe Biden candidacy ahead of the 2020 election, and hoping to tarnish Biden\u2019s reputation, in 2019 he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to spin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. Trump pushed Zelensky to focus on Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as vice president, at a time when Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. Joe Biden was one of many Western leaders who had advocated for the ouster of a prosecutor in Ukraine because he was not pursuing corruption cases. Read a CNN fact check about Trump\u2019s Ukraine claims. Democrats impeached Trump (the first of two times) for improperly dragging a foreign leader into US politics. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. But that bad experience did nothing to stop Trump or Republicans from making allegations about Hunter Biden. At the Republican presidential debate in 2020, Trump brought up Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and also alleged that he was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the Navy Reserve for cocaine use, which is not true. Hunter Biden was administratively discharged, which is standard procedure when an officer fails a drug test. Read a CNN fact check about the discharge claim. In fact, if you search \u201cHunter Biden\u201d in the CNN Facts First database, there are many results. Among them: Did Hunter Biden have a job before his father became vice president? Yes. Did Joe Biden profit from his son Hunter\u2019s career? There\u2019s no evidence. What is Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with China? He did business with Chinese partners. The sheer volume of these fact checks is worth noting as proof, if nothing else, that he is so frequently cited by his father\u2019s political opponents.  When Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives in January 2023, one of their high-profile moves was to launch an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, most of it built on trying to tie the president to his son\u2019s former business career. While House Republicans have referred Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden for criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading Congress, the impeachment inquiry has seemingly fallen apart without unanimous support from Republicans and no evidence of wrongdoing by the president. For Hunter Biden, his name is both a blessing and a curse. It was with help from his last name that he built a lucrative career as an attorney, then lobbyist, who then  did business with companies in Ukraine and China. It is because of his name that he has been so scrutinized. It is a trade-off Hunter Biden has been experiencing for years. When Joe Biden was tapped as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008, they made a point about not consorting with lobbyists. Hunter, then a lobbyist, ended his lucrative lobbying contracts a few months before the election that year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_donald-trump-birthday", "text": "In a rare speechless moment Sunday, Donald Trump stepped back from the microphone as his Las Vegas supporters spontaneously broke into a disjointed rendition of the world\u2019s most recognizable song. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain point at which you don\u2019t want to hear \u2018Happy Birthday,\u2019\u201d the former president said when they finished. \u201cYou just want to pretend the day doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d The day does exist, and it was Friday. Trump is now 78 years old. It\u2019s an age that has clearly occupied space in Trump\u2019s mind for some time. \u201cJust remember what I\u2019m telling you: 78 is not old,\u201d Trump asserted to a New York Post gossip columnist almost two years ago. The offhand remark came during a conversation about his first wife, Ivana, upon the occasion of her passing at age 73. The significance of 78 is unmistakable. It\u2019s the same age his opponent, President Joe Biden, turned shortly after winning the election in 2020. Concerns about Biden\u2019s fitness for office have followed him ever since, accentuated by a physical decline and diminished appearance that Trump\u2019s allies and his campaign have gleefully amplified. Yet, if Trump wins, he would be the oldest president at his swearing in at 78 years and 219 days, surpassing Biden\u2019s previous record of 78 years and 61 days. (Biden, of course, would break his own record on inauguration day if reelected.) And amid his third White House bid \u2013 for which he has maintained a notably light travel schedule and has appeared tired at times during court appearances \u2013 Trump\u2019s own mental acuity has faced intense scrutiny from political foes,\u00a0including\u00a0Biden. \u201cBut let\u2019s all remember Donald Trump is just a flatulent old man with an orange spray-tan who fell asleep at his own trial,\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at the Wisconsin Democratic convention last weekend. There\u2019s this too: For the remainder of the presidential race, just three years will separate the ages of Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, on paper \u2014 a reminder that the two men are indeed of the same era. Born to parents of the Greatest Generation, they each grew up in the aftermath of World War II in a country forever changed by the threat of nuclear war, the proliferation of television and America\u2019s post-war boom. They would\u2019ve overlapped in high school, at least for a time. Through a combination of medial and student deferments, they both\u00a0avoided serving in the Vietnam War. They\u2019re both grandparents. In the rematch between the two oldest presidents to ever serve, the advanced age of the presumptive presidential nominees has been a much-discussed factor. More than half of US adults say both are too old to serve another term, according to an April ABC/Ipsos survey, 10 points higher than a year ago. The same surveys persistently show there are more reservations about the abilities of Biden than Trump \u2014 chiefly because Democrats are far more likely to express concerns about the incumbent\u2019s age and fitness than Republicans are willing to say about their own nominee. Trump, though, does not sound like a man convinced voters see much of a difference. Rather, in his public appearances, the former president\u00a0has labored to project his age as just a number and not a starting point for comparing him to Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t feel 77,\u201d he asserted during a freewheeling soliloquy at Trump Tower the morning after a Manhattan jury convicted him on 34 felony counts. Earlier this year, Trump similarly told an interviewer, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m about 35 years old. I actually feel better now than I did 30 years ago. Tell me, is that crazy?\u201d At his rallies, Trump regularly mocks Biden\u2019s cognitive abilities, and his campaign and allies have made a sport of sharing selectively edited clips of the president\u2019s appearances to unflattering effect. Trump, though, has experienced his own gaffes and verbal slips. Earlier this year, Trump confused former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He has misstated his location and once mistakenly compared his polling numbers to former President Barack Obama, not Biden. His Republican rivals seized on these missteps during the primary, hoping to convince GOP voters that the former president was a shell of the man who first stepped into the political arena nine years ago. Haley called Trump \u201ctotally unhinged\u201d and \u201cdiminished\u201d as she battled him for the nomination. The campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis highlighted Trump\u2019s perceived blunders by publishing a\u00a0\u201cTrump Accident Tracker\u201d while the candidate insisted Trump \u201clost the zip on his fastball.\u201d \u201cWhat Donald Trump does now is, he is wedded to the teleprompter,\u201d DeSantis said at one point. \u201cHe can\u2019t get off that teleprompter.\u201d Increasingly, Biden\u2019s campaign and its surrogates are stepping up attacks on Trump with criticisms similar to those once levied by the former president\u2019s Republican opponents. They notably took a more aggressive turn following Trump\u2019s Las Vegas rally, where his teleprompter malfunctioned causing the former president to ad lib some of his remarks. During one stretch, Trump delivered a 600-word riff about his concerns over battery-powered boats that included an extended stream-of-consciousness debate over whether it would be better to die by shark attack or electrocution. \u201cSo there\u2019s a shark 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards, over here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking, water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking? Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted, or do I jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted?\u201d Trump ultimately concluded: \u201cI\u2019ll take electrocution every single time. I\u2019m not getting near the shark.\u201d Biden\u2019s allies pounced on social media, sharing the diatribe widely. At a private fundraiser in New York this week, second gentleman Doug Emhoff told donors Trump these days lacked comprehension. \u201cThis is a degraded version of an already horrible person,\u201d Emhoff said in reference to Trump\u2019s Vegas speech. \u201cHe is degrading before our eyes.\u201d The chirping continued on the eve of Trump\u2019s birthday as the former president met with Congressional Republicans. In private meetings Thursday in Washington, Trump veered across topics, ranting about Taylor Swift potentially endorsing his opponent to claiming Pelosi\u2019s daughter said the former House Speaker could have dated Trump, which one daughter denied and called \u201cunhinged.\u201d He offered muddled political advice on how Republicans should discuss abortion, bragged about House members who lost seats after voting to impeach him and called the GOP convention host city of Milwaukee \u201chorrible,\u201d spurring conflicting accounts of what he meant from Wisconsin Republicans. Many in the meetings who talked to reporters afterward raved that Trump had presented as unified and strong. The Biden campaign called Trump \u201cfeeble\u201d on social media when the former president ended a post-meeting news conference after five minutes without taking questions. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement to CNN replied to recent attacks by saying that Biden \u201cand his floundering campaign have resorted to becoming parodies of themselves.\u201d \u201cAside from trying to explain away losing his declining memory, shuffling his feet like a short-circuited Roomba, and falling on his ass over and over again, they\u2019ll have to take responsibility for their out-of-control border, runaway inflation, and surging crime rates that have decimated every American,\u201d Cheung said. But the observations about Trump\u2019s age and mental state are not just coming from inside the Biden campaign. Alyssa Farah Griffin, who resigned as communications director in Trump\u2019s White House in December 2020, said on \u201cThe View\u201d there are \u201cglaring warning signs about Trump.\u201d \u201cListening to him now does not sound like him in 2016 and he was not ever particularly eloquent,\u201d Griffin, a co-host on the show and a CNN contributor. \u201cI\u2019m recognizing and seeing a decline in him. Others who\u2019ve known him have said it and I think that that matters.\u201d Notably, Trump\u2019s allies see his age as a potential factor that could keep him out of jail following his felony conviction. Asked about the likelihood of Trump ending up behind bars, Jonathan Turley, an attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School friendly to the former president, said it would be \u201cabsurd.\u201d One of the reasons? \u201cHe is an elderly first offender,\u201d Turley said. Amid the constant questions about Trump\u2019s longevity, though, he has told his supporters not to worry. He has good genes. \u201cMy father lived a long time. My mother lived a long time and they were happy and they were great,\u201d Trump told the Vegas crowd. \u201cSo maybe we\u2019re gonna live a long time.\u201d This headline has been updated.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_trump-black-voters-detroit", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on Saturday launched a coalition group targeting Black voters as the former president campaigned in Detroit in an effort to win over a segment of the electorate that has long overwhelmingly backed Democrats. Trump held a community roundtable at the predominantly Black 180 Church in Detroit, where he was joined by two Black Republicans \u2014 Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 who were part of the launch of the \u201cBlack Americans for Trump\u201d group. Donalds and Carson are among several candidates said to be under consideration to be Trump\u2019s running mate. The former president praised Donalds on Saturday as an \u201cincredible guy.\u201d \u201cI noticed he happened to be on the list of potential vice presidents. Would anybody like to see him as vice president?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. He later added that he thinks Donalds would be \u201ca good one, too.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s on a list, by the way. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to make it. But he\u2019s on a list of a few people, right? Not too many people,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s attempts to court Black voters come as polls show that Black men are more open to supporting the Republican nominee in this year\u2019s election than they have historically been. A\u00a0New York Times/Siena College survey\u00a0of battleground states released last month found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden, which would amount to a historic high if it translates to votes in November. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in\u00a0CNN\u2019s exit poll. While President Joe Biden is likely to win Black voters by a large margin, the siphoning away of even a modicum of support by Trump could tilt the outcome in several battleground states \u2013 including Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Trump has long criticized cities with sizable Black populations. In 2019, he referred to a predominantly Black congressional district in Baltimore as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d In a closed-door meeting with House Republicans this week in Washington, he reportedly described Milwaukee \u2014 where the GOP will hold its convention in August \u2014 as \u201chorrible.\u201d (The Trump campaign said the former president \u201cwas talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are\u201d in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city.) In 2016, Trump said Democrats had long failed Black voters and asked for their votes, famously saying: \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Trump has pushed back on accusations of racism, telling Semafor in a recent interview that he has \u201cso many Black friends\u201d who would not support him if they believed he was racist \u2014 a comment the Biden campaign highlighted Saturday in its response to Trump\u2019s Black coalition launch. \u201cDonald Trump thinks the fact that he has \u2018many Black friends\u2019 excuses an entire lifetime of denigrating and disrespecting Black Americans, but Black voters know better \u2013 and Trump\u2019s eleventh hour attempt at Black \u2018outreach\u2019 isn\u2019t fooling anyone,\u201d Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign\u2019s director of Black media, said in a statement. Trump on Saturday also cited Biden\u2019s role as a US senator in crafting the 1994 crime bill, falsely accusing his opponent of making the same remark Trump once chided Hillary Clinton for making. \u201cBiden wrote the devastating 1994 crime bill, talking about \u2018super predators.\u2019 That was Biden. You know, he walks around now talking about the Black vote. He\u2019s the king of the \u2018super predators,\u2019\u201d Trump said during the roundtable discussion. As CNN has previously noted, Biden did not publicly deploy or endorse the phrase \u201csuper predators.\u201d Biden did warn in a 1993\u00a0speech of \u201cpredators on our streets\u201d who were \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d in support of the crime bill. But he used the phrase \u201csuper predators\u201d only to reject the theory \u2013 arguing in a 1997 speech that the vast majority of youth involved with the criminal justice system were not violent and \u201cnot the so-called super predators.\u201d Trump wrote in a 2000 book that he supported tougher sentencing and street policing and warned of \u201cwolf packs\u201d of young criminals roaming the streets \u2013 and he cited a since-discredited statistical analysis that was linked to the \u201csuper predator\u201d crime theory. As he has before, Trump claimed Saturday that he\u2019s done \u201cmore for the Black population than any American president since Abraham Lincoln,\u201d while arguing that Biden had done \u201cnothing\u201d for the Black community and was \u201call talk.\u201d Trump later spoke at a convention hosted by Turning Point Action in Detroit. Before the former president took the stage at the conservative gathering, Carson touted his onetime boss\u2019s ability to engage with Black communities. \u201cPresident Trump is not your typical politician,\u201d Carson said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t run around with his finger in the air seeing which way the wind is blowing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-black-voters-detroit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The debate, which will be hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta on June 27, will mark the first in-person showdown of the 2024 campaign between President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and his predecessor, former President\u00a0Donald Trump. Both candidates have accepted the network\u2019s invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May. The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. Both candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. Some aspects of the debate \u2013 including the absence of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates. But, as in the past, the moderators \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d according to the network. In order to meet CNN\u2019s qualifications for the debate, candidates must satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets. Participants must also file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so. All participating debaters must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Though not impossible in Kennedy\u2019s case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements. Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-biden-cnn-debate-rules/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_biden-hollywood-fundraiser", "text": "Joe Biden has raised $28 million heading into a star-studded fundraiser Saturday, campaign officials\u00a0told\u00a0CNN, as\u00a0the president\u00a0leans on his Hollywood friends to help boost his campaign war chest. The president\u2019s Los Angeles event with former President Barack Obama, George Clooney and Julia Roberts marks the campaign\u2019s latest effort to tap into celebrity appeal to help Biden win a second term in the White House. The LA fundraiser sets a new record for Democrats, raising more than an event at Radio City Music Hall in March that Biden campaign officials said brought in the party\u2019s biggest haul ever. The Biden campaign ran a contest geared toward small-dollar donors to win a chance to attend Saturday\u2019s\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0and meet Biden, Obama, Roberts and Clooney, who all sent emails or texts encouraging supporters to chip in. The campaign has also provided grassroots supporters at home an opportunity to tune into the event virtually with a donation of $20 or more. \u201cWhen you come up with an event like this, a concept like this,\u00a0you know it\u2019s going to be big. You know it\u2019s going to be exciting. You know it\u2019s going to gather a lot of attention. It\u2019s going to raise a lot of money,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, finance chair of the Biden campaign. \u201cThis one exceeded all of our expectations.\u201d It also comes as the campaign is trying to maintain its cash advantage over former President Donald Trump, who has made significant gains in his fundraising since securing the Republican nomination for president. The Trump campaign said it saw a huge boost in donations in the 24 hours after his conviction in the criminal hush money trial, bringing in $53 million. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel will moderate a conversation with Biden and Obama at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday.\u00a0Other celebrities, including Jason Bateman, Jack Black, Kathryn Hahn and Sheryl Lee Ralph, are also expected to participate in the evening\u2019s program, a campaign official said. Tickets for the Tinseltown event ranged from $250 to $500,000, with special access going to those purchasing tickets in the highest ranges, according to an invitation seen by CNN. Those donating $500,000 fall into the event chair category, which includes four tickets in the front row, a photograph with Biden and Obama, attendance at a special reception with the two presidents and tickets for the after party. The event is modeled after a high-dollar fundraiser featuring Biden, Obama, and former President Bill Clinton in New York City, which raked in more than $26 million. Biden is set to appear at a fundraiser with Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Virginia on Tuesday. In addition to drawing in a significant money haul, the Biden campaign is hoping Saturday\u2019s event will amount to a show of force from the entertainment industry. \u201cThis Saturday we are going to see an unprecedented and record setting turn out from the media and entertainment world,\u201d Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of the Biden campaign who played a major role in Saturday\u2019s fundraiser, said in a statement. \u201cThe enthusiasm and commitment for Biden/Harris couldn\u2019t be stronger. We all understand this is the most important election of our lifetime.\u201d Biden\u2019s advisers have already worked to tap into A-list star power to help push its campaign\u2019s message. Robert De Niro narrated an ad for the campaign, and the longtime Trump critic spoke at a news conference outside the former president\u2019s criminal trial in New York City last month. On Friday, Jane Fonda joined first lady Jill Biden for an event in Reno, Nevada, geared toward mobilizing senior voters. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, hosted a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in London this week and helped organize the three presidents fundraiser in New York City in March. Biden\u2019s advisers anticipate rolling out more endorsements and finding ways for celebrities to engage with the voters as Election Day nears. But many in Hollywood are wary of jumping into the political fray amid a hyper-divisive political landscape, sources have previously told CNN. The conflict in Gaza is among the issues that\u00a0have\u00a0divided Hollywood. The war loomed large over Biden\u2019s glitzy Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March with protesters outside and inside the venue. The Los Angeles fundraiser comes as Biden is looking to boost his campaign war chest amid signs Trump is narrowing the money gap. Biden has led Trump in fundraising for most of the year, but the former president has seen a significant influx in cash come his way since securing the Republican nomination in March. Trump outraised Biden for the first time in April. Trump\u2019s campaign and its affiliated committees announced they brought in $141 million in May, including $53 million in the 24 hours following his historic conviction in his criminal hush money trial. Trump\u2019s operation has yet to announce its cash-on-hand for the month. Biden has not unveiled his May fundraising haul, but his campaign and affiliated committees entered last month with $192 million cash-on-hand.

Biden\u00a0specifically argued on Saturday evening that the next four years could see openings on the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court, potentially leading to the\u00a0appointment\u00a0of\u00a0more conservative justices if\u00a0Trump\u00a0is reelected. \u201cThe idea\u00a0that if he\u2019s reelected he\u2019s going to\u00a0appoint two more flying flags upside down,\u201d\u00a0Biden said in\u00a0an\u00a0apparent reference to\u00a0a\u00a0flag that once flew\u00a0outside the home\u00a0of\u00a0Justice Samuel\u00a0Alito.\u00a0Asked by Kimmel whether he considered this the scariest part\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0second Trump\u00a0term,\u00a0Biden\u00a0responded, \u201cIt is one\u00a0of\u00a0the scariest parts.\u201d \u201cThe\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0has\u00a0never been\u00a0as\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0kilter\u00a0as\u00a0it is today, I mean never,\u201d the president said, discussing the ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and how Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0said other rulings could be reconsidered, including on contraception. Someone in the crowd interjected, \u201cincluding gay rights,\u201d to which\u00a0Biden\u00a0responded, \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d The Biden campaign has been looking to boost his financial war chest amid signs Trump is narrowing the money gap. Biden has led Trump in fundraising for most of the year, but the former president has seen a significant influx in cash come his way since securing the Republican nomination in March. Trump outraised Biden for the first time in April. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to just vote\u00a0against something in this election,\u201d Obama\u00a0said. \u201cWe have someone to worry\u00a0about.\u00a0And there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0whole\u00a0agenda\u00a0that we should be concerned\u00a0about. But we can take pride in\u00a0affirming the extraordinary work that Joe has\u00a0done.\u201d First lady Dr. Jill Biden, who also spoke at the event, touched on similar themes, saying that her husband \u201chonors the rule of law instead of trying to bend it to his own will. And rallies the world to fight for democracy and freedom.\u201d She also made the case for the dangers of a second Trump term, saying, \u201cTrump has told us again and again why he wants the White House. To give himself absolute power. To not be held accountable for his criminal actions. \u2026 To destroy the democratic safeguards that stand in his way.\u201d The first lady suggested that Trump is a bully, saying, \u201cWhen bullies threaten our loved ones, we don\u2019t just stand by.\u201d She added that those in attendance were showing Trump \u201cexactly how we deal with bullies. \u2026 We don\u2019t cower, we don\u2019t turn away. We show up. We speak up.\u201d Obama appeals to \u2018core values\u2019 Obama\u00a0lamented how some in the country have \u201cnormalized behavior that used to be disqualifying,\u201d referencing\u00a0Trump\u2019s recent conviction in his criminal hush money trial. \u201cWe have the spectacle\u00a0of\u00a0the nominee\u00a0of\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the two major parties sitting in\u00a0court\u00a0and being convicted by\u00a0a\u00a0jury\u00a0of\u00a0his peers on 34 counts,\u201d Obama\u00a0said to\u00a0applause. \u201cHis foundation is not\u00a0allowed to operate because it was\u00a0engaging in monkey business. \u2026 You have his organization being prosecuted for not paying taxes,\u201d Obama\u00a0said. Biden\u00a0interjected, \u201cHe paid none.\u201d When Kimmel\u00a0asked\u00a0Biden\u00a0about\u00a0\u201cTrump\u00a0amnesia,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said: \u201cAll you got to do is remember what it was\u00a0like\u201d during\u00a0Trump\u2019s four years, pointing\u00a0to\u00a0Trump\u2019s recommendation that\u00a0people inject bleach to cure Covid-19. Obama\u00a0also urged \u201cthose who\u00a0are conservatively predisposed\u201d \u2014 who may not\u00a0agree with Democrats \u2014 to consider the \u201ccore values\u201d that shaped the country, like \u201cbasic honesty.\u201d Kimmel\u00a0asked Obama\u00a0how he felt\u00a0about\u00a0Trump\u00a0saying he\u2019s done more for Black people than\u00a0any president in history. Obama\u00a0replied \u201cOne thing he did, for example, was\u00a0make them feel even better\u00a0about\u00a0the first Black president.\u201d Jokes fly at star-studded event George Clooney\u00a0and Julia\u00a0Roberts opened up the night\u2019s program. Barbra\u00a0Streisand introduced first lady Jill\u00a0Biden\u00a0while Jason Bateman, Jack Black, Kathryn Hahn\u00a0and Sheryl Lee Ralph\u00a0also entertained the crowd. As\u00a0he spoke\u00a0about\u00a0a\u00a0potential\u00a0second\u00a0Trump\u00a0term, Kimmel\u00a0asked\u00a0Biden, \u201cWhat\u00a0are some things\u00a0a\u00a0president can do to, let\u2019s say,\u00a0a\u00a0talk show host who has\u00a0been making fun\u00a0of\u00a0him every single night?\u201d \u201cEver heard\u00a0of\u00a0Delta\u00a0Force?\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0joked before striking\u00a0a\u00a0more serious tone, \u201cThe idea\u00a0that he\u2019s\u00a0actually threatened retribution. This is the United States\u00a0of\u00a0America. Did you ever think you\u2019d ever, ever, ever hear\u00a0anything like this? Retribution, that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do, he\u2019s going to get back\u00a0at people,\u201d he said. Kimmel\u00a0also noted that Biden\u00a0has\u00a0said he wanted to restore the soul\u00a0of\u00a0the country. \u201cIt looks like we might need\u00a0an exorcism. Is that why you visited the pope?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said.

CENTCOM said the US military destroyed seven radars in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, which had allowed\u00a0\u201cHouthis\u00a0to target maritime vessels and endanger commercial shipping.\u201d The strikes followed a Wednesday Houthi attack on a Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated ship that left one civilian mariner\u00a0missing. The attack on the ship caused severe flooding and damage to the engine room, CENTCOM said. The crew abandoned ship and was rescued by US and partner forces, including the USS Philippine Sea. The cargo ship is still in the Red Sea and is taking on water, CENTCOM said. The ship is drifting from its last reported position, according to the UK Maritime Trade Operations. In addition to the attacks on the radars, US forces destroyed one uncrewed aerial system launched from Yemen and two uncrewed surface vessels in the Red Sea, according to the CENTCOM statement. The Houthis have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack. On Thursday, Iran-backed Houthi militants struck another cargo ship, the M/V Verbena, in two separate missile attacks in the Gulf of Aden, severely injuring a civilian mariner and causing fires on board, according to CENTCOM. The wounded mariner from the M/V Verbena was medically evacuated by aircraft from a nearby US warship. Two days later, the crew issued a distress call indicating it was abandoning the ship \u201cdue to continued fires and an inability to control them,\u201d CENTCOM said Saturday. Another commercial ship responded to the distress signal and is transporting the mariners to safety. Notably, the Iranian frigate IRIN Jamaran was 8 nautical miles from the M/V Verbena and did not respond to the distress call, CENTCOM said in a statement on X. \u201cThis continued reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThe ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.\u201d The US and UK have carried out several rounds of strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including as recently as last week, to try to degrade their weapons supplies. But the Houthis have shown no signs of halting their attacks. \u201cThe United States will continue to act with partners to hold the Houthis accountable and degrade their military capabilities,\u201d CENTCOM said.

{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_felons-inmates-voting-what-matters", "text": "Both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, face sentencing for nonviolent felonies before Election Day. Although it seems unlikely either will be behind bars on November 5, it\u2019s worth noting that how and whether felons and people otherwise detained can cast election ballots has developed into a major civil rights issue in recent years. The rules for how felons, inmates and those facing trial can cast ballots vary from state to state, and a number of recently enacted laws and ballot initiatives will change things further in 2024. In California, where Hunter Biden lives, for instance, only people who are serving time in prison are ineligible to vote, according to a database maintained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In Delaware, where he was convicted in federal court, there are more restrictions on felons voting. In Florida, where Trump lives, there are more restrictions on felons voting than in New York, where Trump was convicted in state court. There are only a few places \u2013 Vermont, Maine and the District of Colombia \u2013 where everyone can vote, even if they\u2019re convicted felons serving time in prison. Everywhere else in the US places prohibitions on incarcerated felons, and some states include other prohibitions. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Kimberly Berryman traveled to Nevada, where Tuesday was primary day and, for the first time, people who are detained, for a variety of reasons, were able to vote despite their incarceration. They met inmates casting ballots for the first time in their lives. Watch their full report. Nevada\u2019s state government gave felons who\u00a0have been released from prison the ability to vote back in 2019. That still left a population of people who are not convicted of a felony but are detained in jail in the lurch. A new law passed this year in Nevada required jails to facilitate access to voting for those non-felons inside jails in the state. Tuesday\u2019s primary was the first test. \u201cTheir vote should not be any less important than the individuals that are out here,\u201d Sadmira Ramic, a voting rights staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, told Murray and Berryman. \u201cThey face those barriers that we here on the outside don\u2019t even really think about.\u201d One major issue is confusion. Unfounded allegations of illegitimate and illegal votes or outright rigged elections have caused confusion among inmates about where they stand, so they often don\u2019t vote at all. For instance, despite Florida voters overwhelmingly agreeing in 2018 to reenfranchise felons in that state, a series of actions by the legislature complicated voting for felons, leading to court battles and confusion. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, made a show of trying to prosecute people for illegally voting in 2022. The ACLU has worked with voting rights groups in Nevada to make sure detained people who have the right to vote can access that right this year, but at one point threatened a lawsuit in order to make sure access to polling booths was granted by primary day. In a presidential election that could be decided by a small fraction of votes in key states like Nevada, even a small number of additional votes could, in theory, change the outcome. Nevada is also the site of a hotly contested Senate race that could determine which party controls the Senate next year. Jagada Chambers, a former inmate who is now a rights restoration coordinator for Silver State Voices, a voting rights group, told Murray and Berryman she hopes politicians will see the potential of asking for the votes of people who are detained. \u201cIn Clark County, you have potential victories lying in those cells,\u201d Chambers said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/felons-inmates-voting-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_garret-graves-louisiana-reelection", "text": "Republican Rep. Garret Graves of Louisiana announced Friday that he will not seek reelection, ending months of uncertainty after a new congressional map made his seat significantly Democratic. \u201cRepresenting South Louisiana and serving in the United States Congress has been an incredible honor,\u201d Graves said in a statement, before adding that \u201crunning for Congress this year does not make sense.\u201d Amid a long and winding legal battle over the congressional lines in Louisiana, the US Supreme Court last month allowed the state to use the new map\u00a0in this year\u2019s elections. A federal judge had previously thrown out the existing map, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. While Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its six-member US House delegation. Under the new lines crafted by the GOP-controlled state Legislature, Grave\u2019s 6th Congressional District was redrawn into Louisiana\u2019s second Black-majority district \u2013 one that Joe Biden would have carried by 20 points in 2020. Graves\u2019 announcement will come as a blow to House Republicans, who are looking to defend their razor-thin majority in the chamber. There had been speculation that Graves could try to challenge a fellow Republican incumbent in a neighboring district. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Louisianan, endorsed all Republican incumbents in the state\u2019s delegation last month, including Graves for reelection to his current 6th District seat. The congressman conceded Friday that running for a different seat this year was not an option. \u201cIt is evident that a run in any temporary district will cause actual permanent damage to Louisiana\u2019s great representation in Congress,\u201d he said in remarks that hinted at potential further legal challenges to the new map. In recent months, Graves has faced opposition from within his own party, at home and in Washington. The new map, which made Graves\u2019 seat more Democratic, was backed by Louisiana\u2019s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Graves backed Landry\u2019s opponent in the state\u2019s gubernatorial primary last year. Graves was also among the closest allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from his leadership post in October. In the lead-up to the historic vote, Graves slammed hard-line members of the House GOP conference who were dangling the threat of ousting McCarthy amid efforts to pass stopgap funding legislation. McCarthy reacted to Graves\u2019 announcement in a social media post Friday evening, describing the Louisiana Republican as \u201ca loyal friend\u201d and \u201cthe best of what public service can and should be.\u201d \u201cNo matter the issue, Garret was the first to jump in with enthusiasm, intellect, and a legendary sense of humor,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that Graves\u2019 \u201cabsence will be a major loss for the conference and the entire House.\u201d Graves was first elected to Congress in 2014, succeeding fellow Republican Bill Cassidy, who vacated the seat for a successful US Senate run. Under the current lines, the 6th District, which includes parts of the Baton Rouge area, has been a Republican stronghold. But the redrawn district now leans decidedly Democratic, stretching from Shreveport in the state\u2019s northwest to Baton Rouge. Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress for two terms in the 1990s, is seen as the front-runner in the district\u2019s jungle primary in November.

{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_biden-trump-tariffs-consumer-prices", "text": "In 2018, then-President Donald Trump put new tariffs on a variety of Chinese-made goods, including baseball caps, luggage and shoes \u2013 and Americans have been paying the price ever since. For example, a\u00a0suitcase that was $100 before Trump imposed the tariffs now goes for about $160,\u00a0and a carry-on that was $425 is now $700, said Tiffany Zarfas Williams,\u00a0who owns the Luggage Shop of Lubbock in Texas. As a small,\u00a0independent retailer, she had no choice but to raise prices on consumers to keep up with what she was charged by the brand name distributors, which paid the tariffs on the imported goods. \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge having to pass those kinds of price increases to the consumer,\u201d she said. Tariffs aren\u2019t the only reason prices went up over the last five years, but Zarfas Williams said she hoped President Joe Biden would lift the duties \u2013 which he previously criticized \u2013 to help alleviate some of the upward pressure on prices. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t get the basics,\u201d Biden said in a post on X in June 2019. \u201cHe thinks tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.\u201d But after a multi-year review of the duties was released last month, the Biden administration decided to keep them in place and raise the rate on a relatively small share of the impacted imports, including things like electrical vehicles and semiconductors made in China. Inflation, which soared earlier during the Biden administration, has cooled even with the tariffs still in place. But Biden\u2019s handling of the economy has dogged his approval ratings. Consumers\u2019 continued anxiety over high prices could be a political liability as he campaigns for reelection against Trump in November. While both candidates have embraced tariffs to protect US industries from China\u2019s unfair trade practices, Biden\u2019s strategy has hit far fewer goods than Trump\u2019s latest proposal to impose a tariff of at least 10% on all $3 trillion worth of US imports if he wins a second term. The tariffs Biden left in place \u2013 which are paid by US importers and not China \u2013 hit roughly $300 billion of goods. And he\u2019s planning to raise the rate on about $18 billion of those goods over the next two years. Supply chain problems that built up after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are also to blame for fueling inflation. But footwear and apparel trade groups say the tariffs on Chinese goods have certainly contributed to rising prices. How tariffs drive up consumer costs When Chinese-made shoes arrive at a US port, American importers like family-run shoe seller Deer Stags pay the tariff. Known for selling comfortable footwear to retailers like JCPenney, Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, Deer Stags has been importing most of its shoe line from China since the 1980s, said the company\u2019s president, Rick Muskat. Even though he\u2019d like to get a US supplier, a variety of factors \u2013 including earlier tariffs \u2013 helped shift most US shoe manufacturing offshore. In 2019, Trump\u2019s new tariffs added a 15% duty on about half of the footwear imports from China. He later lowered the rate to 7.5% in 2020, where it remains. Since the additional tariffs made the shoes more expensive for Deer Stags, Muskat had two choices: either eat the cost of the tariff, impacting his business\u2019s bottom line, or pass some of it along to the consumer. He decided to do a little bit of both. It was harder to get customers to pay more for existing styles that Deer Stags had carried for a long time, he said. So the company ended up eating the cost of the tariffs placed on some older styles and charging more for some new items. \u201cI developed a new style that never existed in our line before that\u2019s subject to the tariffs. So when we do our calculations and try to maintain our margins, those shoes ended up costing more than they would have had the tariff not been implemented,\u201d Muskat said. After Trump\u2019s tariffs hit, some US companies sought new manufacturers in other countries. As a result, China\u2019s share of total US footwear imports fell from 53% in 2018 to 40% in 2022, according to a report produced for apparel and footwear trade groups. But Muskat hasn\u2019t changed suppliers because he found moving production wasn\u2019t going to be cost effective. The Chinese are \u201cvery efficient at what they do. They can make a better product at a lower price, and the American consumer appreciates that,\u201d Muskat said. Phil Page, chairman of Missouri-based Cap America, also raised prices because of the tariffs. The company embroiders caps to sell to distributors of promotional products. Before the trade war began under Trump, Cap America imported most of its inventory directly from China. But once the tariffs hit, Page said, some Chinese manufacturers scrambled to move to other countries to avoid the US tariffs. Now, some of his imported caps are made in Vietnam and Bangladesh \u2013 but they aren\u2019t any cheaper than importing from China. Page said he\u2019s paying about the same, but the manufacturer is getting more money rather than the US government, which collects the tariff revenue. \u201cReally all the tariffs did was scatter the flock around and cost American consumers billions of dollars,\u201d Page said. Are tariffs to blame for inflation? Economists generally agree that tariffs drive up prices. JP Morgan economists estimated in 2019 that Trump\u2019s tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made goods would cost the average American household $1,000 a year. But it\u2019s hard to determine just how much the tariffs \u2013 which didn\u2019t occur in a vacuum \u2013 ultimately contributed to the high inflation the US economy has experienced in recent years. More recently, housing prices are largely to blame for keeping inflation high. The Covid-19 pandemic upended the global economy roughly two years after Trump\u2019s trade war began. Several studies show that Trump\u2019s tariffs only marginally contributed to the rise in US inflation experienced after the pandemic and the following supply chain crisis. But when it comes to apparel, footwear and travel goods, industry trade groups say that the tariffs have undeniably helped to drive up prices on American consumers. The tariffs \u201cdefinitely contributed to the inflation we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Obviously there are other factors there, like the supply chain price. But we were a deflationary industry that turned when the China tariffs went into effect,\u201d said Nate Herman, senior vice president of policy at the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Until recently, average prices on apparel had been trending downward since the 1990s, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There\u2019s an \u201cunmistakable correlation\u201d between the tariffs and how much Americans are paying for shoes, said Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. If Biden had lifted the tariffs, Priest believes shoe prices would eventually come down due to the highly competitive nature of the industry. Hypothetically, one company would inevitably lower their prices and then others would do the same to compete. In a letter sent to Biden in May, major shoe brands, including Adidas, Columbia Sportswear, Nike and Steve Madden, urged the administration to lift the tariffs. \u201cWe are confident that removing 301 tariffs will alleviate a costly burden in this key area and translate to savings for our shoppers,\u201d they wrote, referring to the section of the law Trump used to impose the tariffs. Biden announced he was keeping the duties in place four days after the letter was sent. The Biden administration has said the tariffs are one part of its overall strategy to strengthen US supply chains and protect American consumers and workers from China\u2019s unfair trading practices. China is known for subsidizing its own manufacturers, who then flood the global market with cheaper goods. \u201cThose tariffs have been in place in order to help, I think, balance out some of those dynamics that have been in place for a while,\u201d Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Wednesday when asked about why the tariffs were left in place. He noted how US inflation has come down to 3.3%. It had soared earlier during Biden\u2019s term, peaking in June 2022 at 9.1%. \u201cI think the important thing to recognize is that while those tariffs were in place, we had strong GDP growth, certainly avoided a recession that many people said was almost inevitable, we\u2019ve had unemployment below 4% for over two-and-a-half years,\u201d Bernstein said. Protecting US businesses from China Business leaders across the US, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, tend to agree that China\u2019s unfair trade policies, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers, need to be addressed. Trump\u2019s tariffs were meant to get China to address those issues. But the US Trade Representative\u2019s office recently said that while the tariffs have been \u201ceffective in encouraging\u201d China to \u201ctake steps\u201d toward ending some of its unfair trade practices, it \u201chas not eliminated many of its technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices.\u201d The textile industry, for example, is in favor of not only keeping the tariffs, but raising them. The National Council of Textile Organizations has pressed the Biden administration to increase the rate of the duties on textiles and apparel in order to protect domestic manufacturing from what it calls the \u201cflood of under-valued, subsidized and illegal imports from China.\u201d But leaders of the apparel and footwear industries say they didn\u2019t ask for the tariff protections. \u201cThere are issues with China in terms of intellectual property and a lot of counterfeit product comes out of China, but the tariff policy has done nothing \u2013 and we don\u2019t think will do anything \u2013 to address that issue,\u201d Herman said. While Trump did get Chinese President Xi Jinping to the negotiating table, some of the commitments China made in an agreement reached in January 2020 never came to fruition. Under what\u2019s known as the Phase One agreement, China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products \u2013 setting a target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began. But China fell well short of that pledge. A Phase Two agreement was never reached between the US and China under either the Trump or Biden administrations. Biden \u201chad a great opportunity to set a new policy and set a new direction, and all he\u2019s done is outsource his tariff policy to former President Trump,\u201d Herman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/biden-trump-tariffs-consumer-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_biden-title-ix-protections-blocked-gop-states", "text": "The Biden administration\u2019s efforts to shore up protections for LGBTQ+ students and workers were partially hindered by two separate court rulings on Thursday and Friday. In a preliminary injunction issued Thursday, US District Judge Terry Doughty blocked the Biden administration from implementing the new federal protections for LGBTQ+\u00a0students \u2013 which are set to take effect August 1 \u2013 in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho. A separate ruling Friday by a federal appeals court upheld an existing block on federal guidance seeking to\u00a0protect transgender students\u00a0and workers in 20 states. The case Doughty ruled in is one of more than half a dozen challenging new\u00a0changes to Title IX, the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid. Among other things, the changes aim to curb discrimination \u201cbased on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics,\u201d\u00a0according to the Department of Education. \u201cThe Department crafted the final Title IX regulations following a rigorous process to realize the Title IX statutory guarantee,\u201d department spokesperson Vanessa Harmoush said in a statement after Doughty issued his ruling. \u201cThe Department stands by the final Title IX regulations released in April 2024, and we will continue to fight for every student.\u201d The new rules require schools to protect students from all sex discrimination, including sexual violence and sex-based harassment, expanding that definition to include discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions like childbirth, termination of pregnancy\u00a0or recovery from pregnancy. Compliance with the new rules is required to receive federal education aid. The lawsuit brought by the GOP-led\u00a0states argues that the Biden administration overstepped its authority. The plaintiffs are asking Doughty, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, to strike down the rules nationwide. LBGTQ+ advocates have argued that Thursday\u2019s ruling will have a \u201cdangerous\u201d impact on members of the community in the four states. \u201cToday\u2019s decision prioritizes anti-LGBTQ+ hate over the safety and well-being of students,\u201d Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson said in a statement. \u201cThis is MAGA theatrics with the dangerous goal of weaving discrimination into law.\u201d Appeals court maintains block on federal protections for trans students and workers The 2-1 ruling issued Friday by the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals upholds a preliminary injunction issued nearly two years ago by a federal judge in a case brought by GOP states against federal guidance intended to\u00a0protect transgender students\u00a0and workers in 20 states. The ruling allows the 20 states to continue enforcing\u00a0controversial laws\u00a0without risk of retaliatory action from the administration, including the loss of federal funding for schools. The guidance, issued by the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, is designed to protect transgender individuals from a slew of anti-trans policies, including bans from school sports teams, bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity, and measures that allow employers to intentionally refuse to use a worker\u2019s preferred pronouns. \u201cTaken together, the States are trapped between choosing to enforce state laws or receiving federal funds, all while having to investigate gender-identity and sexual-orientation discrimination (unlike before),\u201d Circuit Judge John Nalbandian wrote in the majority opinion, which was joined by Judge Joan Larsen. Both judges were appointed by Trump. \u201cStates with conflicting laws will be hampered in their ability to enforce their laws, and the States will continue to face pressure to change their laws to avoid legal consequences,\u201d Nalbandian wrote. In dissent, Circuit Judge Danny Boggs said he would have wiped away the preliminary injunction and thrown the case out altogether. The judge said he didn\u2019t believe the plaintiffs had the legal right \u2013 known as \u201cstanding\u201d \u2013 to bring the challenge in the first place. The states that brought this challenge are: Tennessee, Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/biden-title-ix-protections-blocked-gop-states/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_debate-president-trump-republicans", "text": "Following his meetings with congressional lawmakers Thursday, former President Donald Trump spent time at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, participating in what two advisers\u00a0are calling a policy discussion with a small group of advisers and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri. Among the topics discussed were democracy and how to respond to the inevitable questions regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including Trump\u2019s response to the riot incited by his supporters that day. While Trump\u2019s team insists that the meeting was not \u201cdebate prep,\u201d an adviser to the former president acknowledged that these kind of sessions will ultimately be helpful when Trump faces off against President Joe Biden for their first debate, which will be hosted by CNN in Atlanta on June 27. The New York Times first reported on the policy discussion. Advisers are wary of using the words \u201cdebate prep\u201d when it comes to Trump, instead pointing to various interviews and events as examples of how the former president is gearing up to take Biden on, including taking questions from friendly audience members at a recent event. \u201cPresident Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\u201d senior Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is running point on Trump\u2019s efforts in advance of the debate, said in a statement. The upcoming Atlanta debate between Biden and Trump \u2013 which is less than two weeks away \u2013 will mark a historically early showdown that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_media-outlets-use-deceptively-edited-video-to-claim-biden-wandered-off-at-g7-summit", "text": "Right-wing media outlets used a deceptively cropped video to misleadingly claim President Joe Biden wandered off during an event with other world leaders at the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday. Video shared by the New York Post on X showed part of a skydiving demonstration in front of several world leaders in Italy that involved several parachutists landing near the group, with each skydiver carrying a flag representing the different G7 countries. In the full, unedited video, Biden \u2013 who was standing with the group of leaders as a parachutist carrying a G7 banner landed in front of them \u2013 briefly turned away to give a thumbs-up to several parachutists who had landed behind the group, along with a parachute rigger who was kneeling on the ground to pack up one of the skydiver\u2019s chutes and the French flag. Other leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, also briefly look toward that group. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni then walks toward Biden, taps him on the arm, and motions for him to join the other leaders who were being briefed by an Italian Army officer about the demonstration they just watched. But the video shared by the Post on X cropped out the kneeling parachute rigger, omitting the context of why Biden walked away from the group. \u201cPresident Biden appeared to wander off at the G7 summit in Italy, with officials needing to pull him back to focus,\u201d the social-media post said. That claim later became the basis of the Post\u2019s Friday front page, which called Biden the \u201cMEANDER IN CHIEF\u201d and accused the president of embarrassing the US with \u201cconfused wanderings.\u201d The White House on Thursday criticized the Post and outlets for characterizing the president as \u201cconfused\u201d and for using an \u201cartificially narrow frame\u201d to make it appear as if the president was wandering off from the skydiving demonstration. \u201cHe\u2019s saying congratulations to one of the divers and giving a thumbs up,\u201d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a post on\u00a0social media. \u201cBeware cheap fakes \u2026 and all the bad faith actors who post them,\u201d White House communications director Ben LaBolt\u00a0also posted. X later added a community note to the Post\u2019s tweet acknowledging the video had been cropped. A spokesperson for the Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Edited video goes through conservative echo chamber The video of Biden at the skydiving demonstration appeared to have first been flagged by the Republican National Committee, which posted the uncropped video of Biden giving the parachutists a thumbs-up shortly after the demonstration took place. The New York Post shared the cropped version less than 90 minutes later. Other right-wing outlets quickly followed suit. Sinclair stations posted stories saying Biden appeared to wander away at the summit. Those\u00a0stories\u00a0also resurfaced false claims that the president soiled himself at a D-Day ceremony in France earlier this month. A Fox & Friends segment Friday morning reported on the incident and the Post\u2019s front page, with a chyron saying the president appeared \u201cconfused\u201d at the summit. Other world leaders who attended the event with Biden, though, pushed back on the idea that he was confused. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was standing just steps away from Biden, said the president \u201cwas being very polite and went over to talk to all of (the skydivers) individually.\u201d \u201cGiorgia was saying don\u2019t worry they\u2019re all coming \u2013 we were meant to line up and they were coming to shake our hands,\u201d Sunak said,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Telegraph. Cropped video plays on concerns over Biden\u2019s age While emerging technologies like artificial intelligence continue to proliferate and create concern about the impact that misinformation will have on voters ahead of November, the video shared by the Post shows that relatively low-tech efforts, like cropping videos to show Biden out of context, can still be powerful tools to reinforce the idea that the 81-year-old president has lost control of his mental faculties. Every day that Biden is president, he sets a new record as the oldest person to ever hold that office. He would be 86 at the end of a potential second term. And recent events, including special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report that described the president being portrayed as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and recent Biden missteps where he appeared to confuse long-dead world leaders with their living contemporaries, have served to reinforce those concerns. The White House has pushed back on criticism over Biden\u2019s age by pointing toward his packed travel schedule. In just the last two weeks, the president has traveled to France to commemorate D-Day, back to the United States to comfort a son who just became a convicted felon and then embarked on another transatlantic journey to Italy, where he participated in high-stakes discussions about future US support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. From there he heads straight to California to participate in a star-studded fundraiser. The rest of this month will see Biden preparing for his critical June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, who turned 78 on Friday and is also scrutinized for his age. Biden\u2019s campaign and his family members have said his age and the experience that comes with it are an asset to his role, and not a liability. The campaign has sent first lady Dr. Jill Biden to shore up older voters\u2019 support of the president. \u201cJoe and that other guy are essentially the same age,\u201d the first lady said at an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s not be fooled. But what this election is about, it\u2019s about the character of the person leading our country.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is a healthy, wise 81-year-old ready and willing to work for you every day to make our future better,\u201d she added. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/media-outlets-use-deceptively-edited-video-to-claim-biden-wandered-off-at-g7-summit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts", "text": "An unprecedented two weeks of legal drama that yielded historic convictions of a former president and a sitting president\u2019s son have also produced a clear political takeaway. The survival of the rule of law in America and untainted justice may depend on the choice voters make in November. The country\u2019s divergent possible paths under President Joe Biden or presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump were highlighted in the way both men, their families and their political operations reacted to the twin trials and verdicts. Biden made no effort to interfere in the prosecution of his son Hunter with either his executive authority or with the media megaphone of his office. He allowed his own Justice Department to secure a guilty verdict Tuesday that could result in jail time for the recovering addict and hurt his own 2024 campaign. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president said after the jury found his son guilty of lying on a federal background check form and possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. He has already said he won\u2019t pardon his son. In his first reaction to the verdict, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t attack the judge or prosecutors, simply saying he was grateful for the love and support of his family and blessed to be clean again. The Bidens\u2019 comportment contrasted with Trump\u2019s reaction to his own trial and conviction nearly two weeks ago in his hush money case. The ex-president lashed out at witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and the judge. He claimed that \u201cthis was done by (the) Biden administration in order to wound or hurt a political opponent.\u201d He blasted \u201ca rigged decision,\u201d despite the fact the Justice Department was not involved in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney. Since then, Trump has been warning he\u2019d use presidential powers to punish his political opponents and bend the legal system to his will. \u201cSometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump told TV psychologist Phil McGraw last week. \u201cI have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d The former president told Fox News last week, \u201cI would have every right to go after them,\u201d referring to the Bidens. Two Trump claims discredited by Hunter Biden verdict Throughout his trial in Manhattan, his former hometown, Trump, insisted he couldn\u2019t get a fair verdict in a city that votes mostly Democratic. But Delaware is a blue state \u2014 and a jury there just convicted the president\u2019s son. One juror told CNN Tuesday that politics never came up in the deliberations. Jurors in Trump\u2019s trial have yet to speak, perhaps because of fears they could be identified following the ex-president\u2019s intimidation tactics. Had Biden been acquitted, Republicans would surely have argued that a biased jury in a state where everyone seems to know the first family had proven their point. But the guilty verdict blew another of their political arguments out of the water. Joe Biden came to office pledging to restore the independence of the Justice Department following Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to employ its legal and investigative powers almost as a personal law firm during his term. But the former president has left no doubt that he\u2019d do the same and more if he wins back the White House in November and would ignore the DOJ\u2019s core mission statement of enforcing the law with \u201cindependence and Impartiality.\u201d Trump has already vowed to prosecute Biden and his family and to \u201cobliterate\u201d what he calls the \u201cDeep State.\u201d Several outside groups have drawn up plans to help him. The Hunter Biden verdict also contradicted the central rationale of Trump\u2019s multiple legal defenses in his four criminal cases, several civil matters and his entire presidential campaign. This is the false notion that he is a victim of a weaponized legal system by a Justice Department that exclusively targets Republicans. \u201cSo much for the weaponization of the Justice Department to go after just the enemies of the other side,\u201d Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official and federal prosecutor, said on CNN Max on Tuesday. \u201cThis is testament to the fact the Justice Department under (Attorney General Merrick) Garland is trying its very best to steer straight down the middle as it should and bring people to trial that it thinks are worthy of prosecution.\u201d The notion of Justice Department neutrality was bolstered by post-trial comments from David Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware whom Garland elevated to  special counsel to avoid the impression of political bias. Weiss thanked the attorney general for allowing him to act independently. And, he added, in a coda to two fraught weeks that have dragged the justice system into toxic political waters, that \u201cno one in this country is above the law. Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant.\u201d However, Weiss added: \u201cHunter Biden should be no more accountable than any other citizen convicted of this same conduct.\u201d Ken Buck, a former Republican member of Congress, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that Joe Biden had handled the painful matter of his son\u2019s trial and conviction appropriately. \u201c(He did) a great job in trying to stay above the fray and recognizing that his Justice Department was in a very difficult position. People look at this case and realize it was done in an independent and fair way.\u201d Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor and CNN political analyst, said the criminal convictions of Trump and Hunter Biden reflected the huge stakes in November\u2019s election. \u201cNot only is (Joe Biden) saying, the decision is also one that comes from the courts, he\u2019s not saying he\u2019s going to use presidential power to somehow issue a pardon. And you contrast that with the former president who\u2019s attacked the legal system. He\u2019s questioned its legitimacy.\u201d Zelizer added: \u201cVoters will have to make a choice. What kind of response do they want? And what kind of person do they want in the Oval Office come January of 2025?\u201d The idea that the Justice Department is only going after Republicans is not just belied by the Hunter Biden conviction in the gun case and a looming tax trial that awaits him in September. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey is on trial in New York for bribery and corruption. The Justice Department in May indicted another well-known Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, and his wife for allegedly accepting around $600,000 from Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil firm and a Mexican bank in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress. Both Democrats have maintained their innocence. Nevertheless, House Republicans are scheduled to hold a vote on Wednesday on holding Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of President  Biden\u2019s interviews with former special\u00a0counsel Robert Hur. Biden has asserted executive privilege over the files. The truth is unlikely to change the GOP Biden narrative Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin highlighted the contrast between Trump and Biden. \u201cThe Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don\u2019t like the way one case came out. Whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don\u2019t hear a single Democrat crying foul,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. Yet one lesson of the Trump-era is that the truth rarely matters. The revealing of inconvenient facts never penetrates the echo chamber that dominates Republican politics and conservative media. So rather than being chastened by the collapse of the Trump persecution narrative and the successful application of the rule of law in a criminal trial, Trump supporters in Congress merely used the Biden verdict to conjure a new round of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. House Oversight Chairman James Comer said the Delaware trial was \u201ca step toward accountability.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican warned that Justice Department officials were continuing to \u201ccover for the Big Guy, Joe Biden.\u201d Comer repeated accusations that the president had profited from his son\u2019s ethically questionable business operations in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president despite the failure of his committee and the House GOP impeachment probe to find any such evidence. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach. \u201cWe will continue to demand accountability for the corrupt business dealings of the Biden family,\u201d said the Louisiana Republican, a firm supporter of Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s loss in a recent civil case that found that he, his adult sons and his organization had committed massive insurance and banking fraud. Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former White House domestic policy adviser, argued that the Justice Department had actually shown favoritism toward Hunter Biden by not charging him with 50 felonies over foreign influence peddling. The department should \u201ctell him his only way out of life in prison is to testify against the BIG GUY,\u201d Miller said on X. Some of the GOP reaction to Biden becoming a convicted felon was bizarre. One of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, baselessly suggested on X that a verdict produced by a jury of his peers was some kind of elaborate plot. \u201cHunter Biden just became the Deep State\u2019s sacrificial lamb to show that Justice is \u2018balanced\u2019 while the other Biden crimes remain ignored,\u201d she wrote on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_virginia-2024-turning-red", "text": "Republicans are openly floating that this will finally be the year that Virginia shifts from the Democratic column it\u2019s been in for several presidential elections and back into the battleground category where Donald Trump could win. The prospect of turning the state red was the topic of discussion between the former president and Virginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin when they met last week, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. That hope, which GOP strategists and the chair of the Republican National Committee have aired publicly, is partially based on a recent poll showing the presidential race tightening there, and partially the fact that the state has a Republican governor and a state legislature narrowly controlled by Democrats. \u201cWe are seeing real momentum on the ground in Virginia,\u201d RNC chair Michael Whatley said on X recently. Zack Roday, a Republican strategist who works for Youngkin\u2019s political action committee, pointed to recent elections in the state as signs that it is truly a battleground, and, in a year where Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is polling competitively with President Joe Biden nationally, that means the commonwealth is winnable for Republicans. In 2021, Youngkin defeated former Gov. Terry McAuliffe by 2 points, a year after Biden carried the commonwealth by 10 points. Republicans also flipped a US House seat in the 2nd congressional district in 2022 and came close in the state\u2019s 7th congressional district that same year. \u201cYoungkin has clearly moved the state where it\u2019s more competitive, but will it translate to a federal race?\u201d Roday said. \u201cIf we\u2019re here in September and October and it\u2019s 45-45 or 48-48, that\u2019s just really bad\u00a0news [for Democrats] because we\u2019re playing on Democratic terrain.\u201d Votings ends in Virginia\u2019s Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday. The results of those races will offer glimpse into potential turnout and enthusiasm among Republicans and Democrats alike in the general election. Youngkin\u2019s PAC has been active in looking to boost Virginia Republicans this year with eyes on the 2nd and 7th congressional seats in particular. The governor has been on an ongoing heavy media blitz, and the PAC has built a large amount of voter data from recent elections. The PAC has also been active in coordinating with the Trump campaign on data and targeting, according to a Republican strategist with knowledge of that work. Neither Trump nor Biden have spent significantly in Virginia during the general election at this point. The Biden campaign has spent just over $23,000 on digital ads, while the Trump campaign has not spent any money at all, ad tracking data shows. Democrats are skeptical about any Republican chest-thumping for Virginia. \u201cBiden is not taking any blue-ish state like Virginia for granted,\u201d said Max Glass, a veteran Democratic campaign manager. \u201cIf you look at Donald Trump\u2019s numbers in the Republican primary, there was over 250,000 voters who chose not to vote for him. He only got 63%of the vote. Where are those other voters going to go? I don\u2019t see them now that he\u2019s convicted willing to change their mind and return to Trump.\u201d Another veteran Virginia Democratic strategist argued that \u201cthe demographics aren\u2019t there\u201d for Republicans. Democrats, the strategist said, fare well in Virginia whenever Trump is on the ballot. The exception was the year when Youngkin won and Trump was less in the campaign spotlight. \u201cThat is the only period of time where Donald Trump was highly irrelevant. In 2022 races, he was extremely relevant. He was out on the campaign trail. He was doing stuff. \u2026 And when Trump is front and center, Democrats have won.\u201d A Republican presidential candidate hasn\u2019t won Virginia in a presidential election since the George W. Bush reelection campaign in 2004, but prior to that, Republicans dominated the state for 40 years. There hasn\u2019t been a Republican senator representing the state since\u00a0John Warner retired in 2009. This year, Sen. Tim Kaine, a two-term Democrat senator, is running for reelection and is the clear favorite in the race. Hedging bets Privately, Virginia Republicans are more unsure about the GOP\u2019s\u00a0chances in Virginia. They see national headwinds that could buoy Republican chances in this year\u2019s Senate race, as well as Trump\u2019s prospects, but concede that it\u2019s still an uphill battle. \u201cTrump lost to Biden by 10 (points) in the last general, on-year, statewide,\u201d a veteran Virginia Republican strategist, who asked for anonymity to share their mixed views about Republicans\u2019 chances going forward. \u201cVirginia is trending purple but that is a hell of a hill to climb.\u201d Any discussion about Virginia becoming more fertile ground for Republicans again is the latest in a set of floats that a handful of reliably Democratic states could actually, truly flip to Republican leaning states this cycle if Trump wins \u2013 the others being Minnesota, New Hampshire or New Jersey. At a recent appearance in Wildwood, New Jersey, Trump repeatedly suggested that he could win New Jersey in 2024. Biden defeated Trump in New Jersey by nearly 16 points in 2020. \u201cI think there are three states right now that people don\u2019t consider battlegrounds right now \u2013 Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Virginia,\u201d said Jim McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who has done work for the Trump campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d\u00a0 he added, speaking of Republicans\u2019 chances to compete in Virginia. McLaughlin added that it hasn\u2019t been that long since\u00a0 former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell got about 58% of the vote there in his successful 2009 gubernatorial race. Trump himself has shown a persistent interest in being able to say he flipped some of these states. \u201cI thought we won it in 2016,\u201d Trump said of Minnesota in May during a fundraiser for the state Republican party. \u201cI know we won it in 2020.\u201d Trump did not win Minnesota in either race. In 2020,\u00a0 Biden won it by about 230,000 votes, or 7 percentage points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Trump in Minnesota by almost 44,000 votes \u2013 less than 2 points. At a recent donor summit, the former president\u2019s top advisers walked attendees through each state, making an effort to argue the potential to compete in both Virginia and Minnesota, according to multiple attendees of that presentation. But Virginia Republicans are more cautious about their party\u2019s chances of actually winning the Old Dominion. \u201cI believe the polling I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Travis Smith, a Richmond, Virginia-based strategist. \u201cIf Virginia is in play, it\u2019ll be a landslide.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/virginia-2024-turning-red/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_joe-biden-son-trial-analysis", "text": "It would be devastating for any parent to see a child convicted of a crime. To experience it as president before the eyes of the world, during one of the most contentious reelection campaigns in history, would be unfathomable. But that is the ordeal now confronting President Joe Biden after his only surviving son Hunter was found guilty on all counts in a trial in Delaware over his possession of a gun while being addicted to drugs. The jury delivered its verdict Tuesday less than two weeks after presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump learned he had been convicted of all 34 counts in a hush money trial in New York. The double convictions represent a remarkable departure from traditional presidential campaigns. Never has a former president and presumptive major party nominee been convicted of a crime. Nor has the child of a sitting president. Both Hunter Biden and Trump pleaded not guilty. Biden\u2019s statement at the start of the trial \u2014 that \u201cI am the president, but I am also a dad\u201d \u2014 encapsulated the tension of his role as the titular head of the nation\u2019s justice system and the pain he would naturally endure from seeing a cherished son, who has dealt with addiction and worked hard to recover, go on trial in the middle of a media storm. Biden repeated that poignant line in a statement issued immediately after the verdict. And unlike former president Trump after his verdict, Biden accepted the jury\u2019s judgment and the integrity of the legal system. \u201cJill and\u00a0I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAs I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\u201d The Hunter Biden conviction is the latest cruel twist in the story of a family that has endured more tragedies than most could bear. The story of how the future president lost his first wife and infant daughter as a newly elected senator in the early 1970s and brought up his sons with his second wife, the current first lady, has become part of Biden\u2019s personal political mythology. Nearly a decade ago, Biden suffered the loss of his elder son Beau, who had brain cancer. The president\u2019s grief remains raw and often comes to the surface during public events. The trial of Hunter Biden is also occurring at a moment when the president is already under extreme pressure, amid an intensifying reelection campaign in which he is facing an opponent who he warns is bent on destroying American democracy. Biden\u2019s personal burden is, meanwhile, being exacerbated by the fact that at 81, he\u2019s the oldest president in history and opponents highlight every slip or senior moment to charge he\u2019s unfit for office. He just returned from Europe on Sunday, but heads back Wednesday for the G7 summit. And his critical first debate with Trump, on CNN on June 27, will provide the kind of test of his mental faculties and emotional fortitude to match anything any modern president seeking reelection has faced. Two vastly different cases thrust into the same political maelstrom The Hunter Biden and Trump cases are vastly different, as is the way the former and current first families have responded to the trials. For instance, there have been no daily rants by the president\u2019s son about a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d judge. Trump\u2019s conviction for falsifying financial records to cover up a payment to an adult film star, by contrast, prompted the ex-president to warn of retribution. He\u2019s also absurdly claimed he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident who compares to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela. In the latest stage of his legal morass, Trump sat through an online pre-sentencing meeting Monday that came two days after he used his Truth Social network to launch a fresh assault on the probity of the verdict he has vowed to appeal. \u201cThese are not legitimate trials; they are merely part of an illegal POLITICAL WITCH HUNT the likes of which our Country has never seen before!\u201d Trump wrote. The former president\u2019s sentencing has been set for July 11, just a few days before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s sentencing is not expected to occur until October. Joe Biden, who has said he is trying to restore faith in the justice system after the Trump presidency, said in a solemn ABC News interview that he won\u2019t pardon his son. This is especially significant since Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted, although a sentence for a first-time offender is unlikely to be that severe. First families in the spotlight While cameras were barred from the courtroom in both trials, each unfolded against a backdrop of taut political drama and the glare of publicity surrounding the former and current first families. The ex-president\u2019s adult sons Eric and Donald Jr. sometimes attended court in New York. And crowds of GOP lawmakers \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 were eager to embroider the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s claims that he was a victim of politicized justice in what amounts to an attack on the rule of law by a major American political party. Former first lady Melania Trump did not attend. Biden has stayed away from his son\u2019s trial in Wilmington, but first lady Jill Biden has led a gathering of the clan at the courthouse for the last week. She crossed the Atlantic four times last week, balancing her official role alongside her husband at D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations and in a state visit to France with her desire to be with her son in his hour of greatest need. In one striking moment in the trial\u2019s closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors drawn from a state where many families have a story about interacting with the Bidens that they should draw no inference from the first family\u2019s rock-solid bond and presence at the trial. \u201cPeople sitting in the gallery are not evidence. You may recognize them from the news \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d\u00a0Wise added: \u201cYour decision can only be made on evidence.\u201d The infringements on the Biden family\u2019s dignity and privacy cut deep during the trial, which saw discomforting testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s former cocaine addiction. Beau Biden\u2019s widow, Hallie, who had a relationship with Hunter as they grieved, testified about their joint cocaine use that she said now embarrasses and shames her. In a heart-rending scene, the accused\u2019s daughter, Naomi, was brought to the stand by the defense, then came under a rigorous cross-examination from prosecutors. The way addiction ravages loved ones as well as the user was laid bare when a text from Naomi to her father reading, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad, I can\u2019t take this,\u201d was introduced into evidence. Media organizations, meanwhile, played an excerpt from Hunter Biden\u2019s audio book that chronicles his spiral into addiction that was used in the prosecution case. Two politicized trials with critical differences Given the identities of those involved and the fraught national moment in the middle of a bitterly contested general election, there\u2019s no way the Trump and Hunter Biden trials could not have become politicized. Trump has claimed that he\u2019s the victim of a vendetta by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, though he was indicted by a grand jury, enjoyed the presumption of innocence like any other accused felon and was judged by a jury of his peers. When Biden\u2019s plea deal collapsed in the court of a Trump-appointed judge and when Attorney General Merrick Garland made David Weiss, the prosecutor investigating Biden, a special counsel, some Democrats asked whether Republican pressure designed to damage the president had weighed on the renewed push for a trial. But both trials have been conducted according to the rules of evidence and provided expansive protections for the accused. And the same bedrock American principle that was cited by prosecutors in the Trump hush money trial was used by Wise in his summation on Monday. \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d he said, urging jurors not to treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d There is a critical difference between the two trials that debunks much of the political noise around them. Hunter Biden, unlike Trump, did not serve as president and has no chance of sitting in the Oval Office as commander in chief on January 20. While Biden is facing serious charges and will go on trial again in September in a separate tax case, his alleged offenses have nothing to do with the Constitution or threats to democracy. Trump\u2019s charges, however, focus on alleged mishandling of national security documents that he hoarded at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office. He has also been charged in two separate cases \u2014 one federal and one in Georgia \u2014 with the ultimate crime in a democracy: seeking to overturn the will of voters. The former president is waiting for a US Supreme Court ruling on his sweeping claims of immunity arising from the federal election interference case that, if the court rules his way and he wins a second term, could augur a presidency of almost no constraints that could verge on autocracy. The second distinction lies in the fact that Joe Biden\u2019s behavior is not an issue in the criminal cases against his son. And House Republicans have so far failed to find that the president benefited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals in nations like Ukraine and China while his father was vice president \u2014 even if the younger Biden\u2019s activity raises serious ethical questions.

{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-michigan-man-of-the-year", "text": "For the\u00a0third consecutive presidential election, former President Donald Trump is\u00a0lying\u00a0that he was named \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in Michigan before he ran for president. Trump\u00a0said it again\u00a0on Saturday during a speech in Detroit: \u201cYou know, I got the \u2018Man of the Year\u2019 in Michigan. Years ago, long before politics, like 12, 13 years ago.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim remains false. Nobody has ever been able to find any evidence that he was ever named \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in Michigan before he ran for president. The state itself does not give out a \u201cMan of the Year\u201d award; Trump has never lived in Michigan; and he has never specified who supposedly gave him this award and when. After\u00a0nearly seven years\u00a0of media fact checks\u00a0of Trump\u2019s many\u00a0declarations\u00a0that he had once been named Man of the Year in Michigan, a Republican group in the state, the Oakland County Republican Party,\u00a0gave him\u00a0its first-ever\u00a0\u201cMan of the Decade\u201d award at an event in 2023. But Trump made clear Saturday that this is not what he was talking about. Rather, he said again that he had been named \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in Michigan more than a decade ago. Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s Sunday request for any evidence that he received such an award. Trump himself has professed confusion about who supposedly gave him the award and why. In a 2022 speech in Michigan, he\u00a0said, \u201cYour Chamber of Commerce, somebody, who the hell knows what it is, they named me the Man of the Year in Michigan.\u201d (Michigan\u2019s Chamber of Commerce had long made clear that it\u00a0did not have\u00a0such an award.) In a 2019 speech in New Hampshire, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cIn fact, five or six years before I even thought about running, for whatever reason they named me \u2018Man of the Year\u2019 in Michigan. I said, \u2018How come?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even understand it myself.\u2019\u201d The most plausible explanation of Trump\u2019s story \u2014 to be specific, the most plausible explanation of what Trump has been inaccurately describing \u2014 came from Dave Trott, a former Republican US congressman in Michigan. After Trump made the claim in 2019, Trott\u00a0contacted CNN\u00a0to note that at a roundtable event with automotive executives in 2017, Trump had\u00a0suggested\u00a0he received the \u201cMan of the Year\u201d award at a 2013 event in Michigan where Trott had invited him to give a speech, a\u00a0Lincoln Day dinner\u00a0Trott had chaired in Oakland County.\u00a0At that event, Trott\u00a0gave Trump\u00a0a framed copy of Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and other gifts. But Trott emphatically noted that he did not give Trump any \u201cMan of the Year\u201d award, nor did anyone else there. Trott had become a fierce Trump critic by 2019. He\u00a0told CNN then\u00a0that, as a sitting congressman during the 2017 roundtable, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to correct the president in front of the automotive executives.\u201d He added: \u201cBut now that I\u2019m out of Congress, I feel comfortable correcting the story.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-michigan-man-of-the-year/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

According to a State Department fact sheet, NRM was designated \u201cfor having committed or attempted to commit, posing a significant risk of committing, or having participated in training to commit acts of terrorism that threaten the security of United States nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d The designation of NRM comes as US officials have warned that\u00a0White\u00a0supremacist terror groups continue\u00a0to pose a threat at home and abroad. The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community found that the \u201ctransnational racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE) movement, in particular motivated by white supremacy, will continue to foment violence across Europe, South America, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand inspiring the lone actor or small-cell attacks that pose a significant threat to U.S. persons.\u201d \u201cNRM\u2019s violent activity is based on its openly racist, anti-immigrant, antisemitic, and anti-LGBTQI+ platform,\u201d Miller said Friday. \u201cThe group\u2019s members and leaders have carried out violent attacks against political opponents, protestors, journalists, and other perceived adversaries.\u201d \u201cNRM members have also taken steps to collect and prepare weapons and explosive materials, including on behalf of the group and in furtherance of its goals,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cIn addition, NRM has organized training in violent tactics, including hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting.\u201d The State Department said they were making the designations as \u201cpart of a broader U.S. government effort to address the transnational dimensions of the threat posed by REMVE actors and reflect the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s continued commitment to countering domestic terrorism (DT), which includes REMVE.\u201d In remarks Wednesday, a top State Department counterterrorism official warned that \u201ctransnational linkages\u201d were increasing, \u201cwith individuals and groups communicating both online and in-person, radicalizing individuals\u2014frequently young people\u2014to violence, recruiting, and sharing tactical training, including sharing instructions for making weapons.\u201d \u201cREMVE actors are becoming more and more adept at exploiting social media platforms, online gaming platforms and game-adjacent platforms, smaller websites with targeted audiences, and encrypted chat applications to recruit new followers, plan and rally ideological support, and disseminate materials that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence,\u201d said Ian Moss, the\u00a0deputy\u00a0coordinator for the Bureau of Counterterrorism. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order that gave the US government greater latitude to go after groups who train terrorists, not only groups that carry out terrorist attacks. Friday\u2019s designation will deny NRM members from accessing the US financial system, with the intention of making it more challenging for them to move money through the international system and fund their efforts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/us-designates-nordic-neo-nazi-group-terrorists/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump got his 78th birthday present a day early \u2014 a handshake from his longtime bitter critic, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0encapsulating the Republican Party\u2019s complete submission to its presumptive presidential nominee. The twice-impeached 45th president and newly convicted criminal was back on Capitol Hill Thursday for the first time since his supporters beat up police officers and smashed their way through the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. A rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d from House Republicans contrasted with the cries from more than three years ago to \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d from Trump\u2019s mob as they acted on his plea to \u201cfight like hell\u201d after weeks of promoting false claims about election fraud. Keen to please their champion and create an optimistic omen for November, House members paid tribute to the ex-president with a bat and game ball they won after trouncing Democrats in the annual congressional baseball game Wednesday. There was a distinct impression of subordinates paying homage to a strongman leader. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 primary opponent now seen as a potential GOP vice presidential nominee, called it \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d after GOP senators feted Trump a mere two weeks after he became the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. Another 2016 foe of the ex-president, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who endured insults Trump flung at his father and his wife, stood to applaud his vanquisher. But the most striking image from the day was a handshake between McConnell and the ex-president captured in a photo by Doug Mills of The New York Times that sums up an era. The veteran Kentucky senator has never hidden his disdain for Trump, though he has always sought to preserve his own power and didn\u2019t take steps to convict him in Senate trials after his two impeachments. The dislike has been mutual, with the former president blasting McConnell as \u201cthe old crow\u201d at rallies and making racist comments about McConnell\u2019s wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. In January 2021, McConnell said, \u201cThe mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.\u201d He said Trump was morally and practically responsible for the assault on his beloved Capitol. On Thursday, after meeting Trump for the first time since that day of infamy, he lauded their \u201centirely positive\u201d encounter, during which the former president clasped McConnell\u2019s hand in both of his. It would strain credulity that McConnell has shed his private contempt for the ex-president. But he told reporters who asked him about their meeting: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you that was negative.\u201d The exchange between McConnell and Trump was an apt emblem for a day that Trump choreographed to show a coming together in his party \u2013 despite the thousands of votes cast in GOP primaries for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for months after she suspended her campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\u201d the ex-president said. \u201cWe want to see borders. We want to see strong military. We want to see money not wasted all over the world.\u201d How Trump asserts power Trump\u2019s assertion of omnipotence over his party was an example of the power projection he adores, which often requires the subordination of supplicants. And it also showed what Republicans who want their own power are prepared to do to keep it. The pageant of adulation on Capitol Hill was also yet another reminder that there will be no price for Trump to pay in his party for an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power. And it was likely a preview of the deference to Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts and zeal for vengeance that America can expect from Republicans in Washington should he win back the White House \u2013 even from those in a branch of government that is supposed to constrain presidents. Another of Trump\u2019s possible vice-presidential picks, Ohio Sen J.D. Vance, was asked how some senior Republicans who had condemned Trump after January 6 could meet and applaud him now. \u201cNo real Republican with any credibility in the party is still blaming him,\u201d Vance, who had not yet been elected at the time, said, adding that some of Trump\u2019s critics in the room were supportive. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing and the Republican Party is in a good place.\u201d Vance is not wrong. Almost every major Republican who stood up to Trump in 2021 is gone or on the way out of the door. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is retiring. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was driven out of House leadership and then Congress for telling the truth about his election lies. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan harshly criticized Trump this week for breaking his oath of office to uphold the Constitution. But his comments on Fox News came amid a comfortable retirement, all his ambition long gone. Lawmakers who stood alongside Trump on Thursday did not necessarily do it because they like him. His huge popularity in the grassroots GOP means that they know that they can say goodbye to their political futures if they choose not to. This is even the case when Trump\u2019s deportment insults the normal codes of behavior expected of a presidential nominee. Biden speaks of democracy abroad while Trump undermines it at home Trump\u2019s return to Washington came the day before he turned 78, the age at which President Joe Biden \u2014 whom his predecessor says is too old to serve \u2014 took office after beating him in the 2020 election. Their 2024 rematch is neck-and-neck, according to polls, with each seeking to make the contest a referendum on the other\u2019s single term. Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to try to exploit Trump\u2019s return visit to a city he left scarred and traumatized by the Capitol riot, releasing a new campaign video that showed scenes of the assault. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more sacred than our democracy, but Donald Trump\u2019s ready to burn it all down,\u201d a narrator said in the ad, which is airing in battleground states. Biden, 81, was thousands of miles away from Washington when Trump showed up, participating in the G7 summit in Italy. It\u2019s the second foreign trip in two weeks he is using an as allegory for a US presidential season he is trying to cast as a fight to save American democracy. Unveiling a series of new plans to boost Ukraine diplomatically, militarily and economically, the president recalled that the US and its allies had been repeatedly asked whether they\u2019d stand firm for a country that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to wipe off the map. \u201cWe will say it again, yes, again and again and again we\u2019re going to stand with Ukraine,\u201d Biden said, as he stood with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A flurry of initiatives to institutionalize Western support for Ukraine being unveiled at the summit are a clear effort to hedge against the possibility that Trump could return to power on January 20, 2025. The ex-president frequently cozied up to Putin while in office and has said he\u2019d end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours \u2014 a feat that could only be achieved by locking in Russia\u2019s territorial gains after its brutal invasion Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton warned on Thursday that Biden could not guarantee that the 10-year pact that covers military training, intelligence cooperation and other areas that he signed with Zelensky on Thursday would last. \u201cI think it is illusory, though, for anyone to think Trump would be bound by it. If Trump is inaugurated at noon on January 20 next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,\u201d Bolton told Bianna Golodryga on CNN International. If Trump gets elected and does walk away from Ukraine, he will complete the transformation of a Republican Party that once prided itself in standing up for democracy worldwide and that, under President Ronald Reagan, won the Cold War. \u201cYou can\u2019t bind a future president who doesn\u2019t want to be bound,\u201d Bolton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin", "text": "President Joe Biden is leading the world\u2019s richest democracies in sending a beefed-up message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the West will not forsake Ukraine despite political shocks casting doubts over its commitment. Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago. \u201cWe will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,\u201d Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. \u201cUkraine\u2019s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. \u2026\u00a0The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president\u2019s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe\u2019s security. And the \u201cautocrats of the world\u201d name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House. Biden\u2019s emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy. But uncertainty over the West\u2019s long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It\u2019s fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky. In the United States, Trump \u2013 who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe\u2019s security given his endless attacks on NATO \u2013 may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend \u2013 especially in powerhouses France and Germany \u2013 could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin\u2019s willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does. But a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine\u2019s Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America\u2019s fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November. A flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine Still, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent. \u2014Biden\u2019s return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House\u2019s priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries. \u2014As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin\u2019s war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. \u201cRussia today has become a war economy,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. \u201cEvery day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.\u201d \u2014Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine\u2019s armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we\u2019ll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power. \u2014US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit \u2013 which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada \u2013 will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets. \u2014These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky\u2019s elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance. Russian advances on the battlefield These are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured. The latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites \u201ca worrisome trend\u201d of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Relentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv\u2019s electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon. Russian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe\u2019s territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war. \u201cThe Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,\u201d Clark said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Technically, they\u2019re pretty smart. They\u2019ve got China behind them; they\u2019ve got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later. An inspiring war turns into a bitter slog An extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes. At times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky\u2019s interactions with the West. The Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package \u2013 a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up. Biden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan. Not surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden\u2019s core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president\u2019s critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to \u201ctake bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom.\u201d But there\u2019s a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_jill-biden-age-campaign-trail", "text": "First lady Dr. Jill Biden is hitting the campaign trail on a double mission this week, courting older voters to support her husband\u2019s reelection bid while also tackling voters\u2019 concerns about his age. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about stopping an extremist, and this election is most certainly not about age,\u201d the first lady said at an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin. \u201cJoe and that other guy are essentially the same age. Let\u2019s not be fooled. But what this election is about, it\u2019s about the character of the person leading our country.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is a healthy, wise 81-year-old ready and willing to work for you every day to make our future better,\u201d she added. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it.\u201d Her remarks came at her first stop of a three-day campaign swing through Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Nevada and Arizona. The campaign has deployed the first lady to help boost support among older voters, a group that has typically voted Republican in presidential elections but has shifted toward President Joe Biden in this year\u2019s contest. Age has proven to be an inescapable issue in the rematch between two seniors \u2013 Biden, 81, and former President Donald Trump, who turned 78 on Friday. But the first lady is using her unique position as a spouse of the oldest president in US history and a senior herself \u2013 she turned 73 last week \u2013 to speak of the benefits of aging and appeal to an important voting bloc. \u201cThe woman I am today is wiser, stronger, more insightful and more confident than I was all those years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery line on my face has been earned by the furrowed brows of difficult decisions made. By the\u00a0sun of countless roads traveled, by the sweet strain of deep laughter with the people I love. Age is a gift.\u201d The first lady has emerged as perhaps the most active surrogate for her husband\u2019s campaign. She\u2019s jetted around the country for political events and fundraisers in the past year while juggling her duties at the White House and in the classroom. Her campaign schedule is expected to pick up even more in the summer months and heading into the fall. Dr. Biden also has fully embraced a role as a forceful critic of her husband\u2019s predecessor. \u201cMake no mistake, Donald Trump is dangerous to our livelihoods, to our security, and the future of our country,\u201d the first lady said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. She\u2019s lambasted\u00a0Trump over his treatment of women and his stance on reproductive rights. In an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d last month, she spoke starkly of the contest between her husband and his predecessor, arguing voters will \u201cchoose good over evil\u201d in November. This week\u2019s campaign push comes as Dr. Biden continues to balance her responsibilities as a top surrogate for her husband\u2019s campaign with her role as a key support system for her family as they grapple with the legal and emotional fallout from her son Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction on three felony gun charges. The first lady devoted much of the past week and a half to providing in-person support for her son. She sat a few feet behind Hunter in the courtroom through most of the trial as the sordid details of his struggles with addiction and a turbulent period in the family\u2019s history were aired out in a Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom. After less than three hours of deliberation, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three charges on Tuesday, a chain of events that moved with such speed that the first lady did not make it to court in time to hear the decision read. Dr. Biden arrived within minutes, and after meeting with her son, family and allies inside the courthouse, she walked out of the building hand-in-hand with Hunter in a public show of solidarity. President Biden made a last minute trip to Wilmington a few hours later to be at his family\u2019s side, tightly embracing his only living son on the tarmac shortly after Marine One touched down in Delaware. \u201cJill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that,\u201d the president said in a statement after the verdict was announced. The first lady has yet to comment on Hunter\u2019s conviction and is unlikely to discuss it unprompted. Instead, she\u2019ll spend the next few days trying to keep the focus on her work to reelect her husband. The first lady\u2019s travel this week is part of the campaign rollout of \u201cSeniors for Biden,\u201d an organizing effort aimed at turning out voters 65 and older. Trump won voters 65 or older by five percentage points in 2020, according to CNN exit polls. But recent surveys have shown a swing in support among older voters toward Biden. At the same time, the campaign\u2019s efforts to draw in seniors come amid signs of a narrowing of the president\u2019s support in other key parts of his coalition, including young, Black and Latino voters. The first lady kicked off her swing Thursday with stops in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. On Friday, she\u2019ll speak at another seniors-focused event in Reno, Nevada, with actress and activist Jane Fonda, and attend a fundraiser in Los Gatos, California. She\u2019ll continue the swing on Saturday with an event in Phoenix, Arizona. Advisers believe the president\u2019s pitch on strengthening Social Security and Medicare and lowering prescription drug costs along with the need to protect democracy resonates with older voters as they make their contrast arguments against Trump. The Biden campaign is looking for creative ways to mobilize those voters over the age of 65 heading into November. They\u2019ve organized pickleball tournaments, bingo games, pancake breakfasts and ice cream socials across key states this week. The first lady is betting those efforts will pay off. \u201cNo, we cannot be defined by a number. And when people underestimate us, they do it at their own risk,\u201d the first lady said in Duluth on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s show what these years can do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/jill-biden-age-campaign-trail/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is making a concerted effort to win over Black voters \u2013 in part by making inaccurate claims. During a Saturday\u00a0roundtable discussion\u00a0at a predominately Black church in Detroit, Trump said President Joe Biden \u201chas done nothing for you except talk,\u201d\u00a0adding: \u201cWe achieved the lowest African American unemployment rate and the lowest African American poverty rate ever recorded \u2013 ever, ever recorded \u2013 during my four years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims about having achieved the lowest Black unemployment rate and poverty rate ever recorded were true\u00a0when he made them\u00a0before Biden took office, but they are not true today. Both of the record lows set during Trump\u2019s presidency were surpassed by new record lows during Biden\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 Trump could have correctly said Saturday that, during\u00a0his presidency, Black unemployment and Black poverty hit their lowest levels ever recorded\u00a0as of that point. Instead, he deceptively portrayed records that have been bested under Biden as supposed evidence that he has done more for the Black community than Biden has. Let\u2019s look at the data. Black unemployment: Record low set in 2023 under Biden The record low for the Black or African American unemployment rate, 4.8%, was\u00a0set under Biden in April 2023. That beat the Trump-era low that was a record at the time, 5.3% in August 2019 and September 2019. (A cautionary note: This official data series goes back only to 1972.) The most recent Black or African American unemployment rate, for May 2024, is 6.1%. Though that is a clear uptick from the 2023 record, it is\u00a0low by historical standards. And it is the same as the rate under Trump in February 2020, just before the Covid-19 pandemic caused unemployment to skyrocket. In the month Biden took over from Trump, January 2021, the Black or African American unemployment rate was 9.3%. The early pandemic jump is a good example of how unemployment rates, like all economic figures, are affected by factors other than who the president is. Black poverty: Record low set in 2022 under Biden The record low in the official poverty rate for Black individuals, 17.1%, was\u00a0set under Biden in 2022, the most recent year for which the data is available. Under Trump, the\u00a0lowest official poverty rate for Black individuals\u00a0was a then-record\u00a018.8% in 2019. There are\u00a0different ways to measure poverty. The Biden era also\u00a0holds the record low, 11.3%, for Black individual poverty under the\u00a0Supplemental Poverty Measure, which incorporates cash and noncash government benefits, tax credits, people\u2019s necessary expenses and geographic differences in the cost of living. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0supplemental figure for Black individual poverty under Trump was 14.7% in 2020. The supplemental figure for Black individual poverty spiked to 17.2% in 2022 after the\u00a0expiry\u00a0of pandemic relief\u00a0initiatives\u00a0that had lowered the figure in 2020 and 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_us-temporarily-dismantle-gaza-pier", "text": "The US military will temporarily dismantle the\u00a0humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza\u00a0and move it back to Israel on Friday night, amid concerns that heavy seas could once again break\u00a0it just days after it resumed aid delivery operations, multiple\u00a0US\u00a0officials and US Central Command said. It will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the\u00a0Shore,\u00a0or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of Ashdod.\u00a0It is a pre-emptive safety measure, a US official said,\u00a0and aid operations across the pier will be suspended until sea conditions allow for it to be moved back into place. Humanitarian aid deliveries across the pier continued for a full day on Friday, the official said, and it is expected to be detached and towed to Ashdod late Friday night local time. \u201cThe decision to temporarily relocate the pier is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement. \u201cAfter the period of expected high seas, the pier will be rapidly re-anchored to the coast of Gaza and resume delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. Since May 17, over 3,500 metric tons (7.7 million pounds) have been delivered through the maritime corridor for onward delivery by humanitarian organizations,\u201d CENTCOM continued. To date, the pier has been\u00a0used to move\u00a0thousands of tons of aid into Gaza, officials have said, but\u00a0it has been plagued with logistical issues since becoming operational in May. Last month,\u00a0rough seas caused four US Army vessels supporting the pier to break free from their moorings and wash ashore on Israeli beaches.\u00a0Also last month,\u00a0the pier broke\u00a0apart and sustained damage in heavy seas and had to be towed to Ashdod for repairs that took over a week. It was moved back to Gaza last week and resumed operations on Saturday but had to pause again due to heavy seas on Sunday and Monday. Officials have told CNN that\u00a0sea conditions in the eastern Mediterranean will only worsen as fall and winter approach, raising questions about the pier\u2019s realistic lifespan. Meanwhile,\u00a0the World Food Programme\u2019s aid distribution operations at the pier have been suspended for\u00a0days,\u00a0and aid has been piling up in the staging area on the beach in Gaza, officials said this week. The operations will remain paused pending a\u00a0WFP\u00a0risk assessment, which is ongoing after the Israel Defense Forces conducted operations near the pier\u00a0Saturday as part of a hostage rescue operation. The presence of at least one Israeli helicopter so close to the pier led the US military to forcefully push back on any claims that it was used as part of the Israeli operation, reiterating that it is a humanitarian mission only. Once the WFP assessment is completed, it will\u00a0fall on\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations\u2019\u00a0Department of Safety and Security and the humanitarian coordinator to make a decision on whether to resume operations at the pier. Humanitarian officials say\u00a0that\u00a0while\u00a0getting\u00a0any assistance\u00a0into the Gaza\u00a0Strip\u00a0is useful, the pier is not a long-term sustainable solution. The Israeli government for months refused to open additional land crossings for aid into Gaza, and only did so after immense pressure by the US government in recent months. Even with additional openings, major obstacles to distribution within the Gaza\u00a0Strip\u00a0remain,and humanitarian officials tell CNN that there is still not an effective deconfliction method to protect aid workers. CNN reported on Thursday that the US military\u00a0was considering dismantling the pier.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_bannon-turning-point-trump-retribution", "text": "Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of Donald Trump, vowed investigations and prosecutions of those who have probed the former president and his political allies, declaring at a conservative gathering Saturday that Inauguration Day in 2025 will be \u201caccountability day.\u201d Pointing to Trump\u2019s recent conviction in New York, Bannon told a crowd at Turning Point Action\u2019s \u201cThe People\u2019s Convention\u201d in Detroit, hours before Trump was scheduled to speak, that the former president\u2019s allies are going to \u201cget every single receipt.\u201d \u201cYou are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has nothing to do with retribution. It has nothing to do with revenge. Because retribution and revenge might be another order of magnitude. This has to do with justice.\u201d Bannon was referring to\u00a0recent comments by Trump vowing to be his supporters\u2019 \u201cretribution\u201d\u00a0and saying\u00a0that \u201csometimes revenge can be justified.\u201d Trump has repeatedly bypassed opportunities from friendly interviewers \u2014 including multiple conversations with Fox News host and friend Sean Hannity \u2014 to dial back his rhetoric and walk away from threats of retaliation against his political opponents and over his criminal prosecutions. \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president told Hannity earlier this month. Some Trump allies, including another veteran of his 2016 campaign and the Trump White House, former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, have downplayed the former president\u2019s comments. Earlier this month, Conway noted that Trump\u2019s Justice Department did not try to prosecute Hillary Clinton despite the chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at 2016 campaign rallies. But other allies have responded more forcefully to Trump\u2019s conviction in his New York hush money trial. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo, an attorney in the prosecutor\u2019s office, testify \u201cabout the unprecedented political prosecution of President Trump.\u201d In response to the verdict, several Republican senators \u2014 including vice presidential contenders Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio \u2014 signed a letter signifying they would not work with the Biden administration to pass legislation, confirm his judicial nominees or increase non-security spending. Bannon\u2019s incendiary speech comes two weeks before he is due to report to prison. He was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 after failing to provide documents and testimony to the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. He was sentenced to four months in prison, and a federal judge earlier this month ordered him to report to prison by July 1. Once a top adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and a senior White House aide, the bombastic Bannon is now a right-wing podcaster with a following of loyal Trump supporters. He is no longer the Trump insider he once was, but Bannon was influential in House conservatives\u2019 ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and he has taken credit for the removal of former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. His \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast has also been a megaphone for false claims of election fraud and a rewriting of the history of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Rallying the room around the former president\u2019s recent conviction in New York, Bannon claimed, without elaborating, that Trump is \u201celigible for 700 years in prison\u201d and \u201cthey want him to serve all of it.\u201d Trump\u2019s sentencing in the New York case, so far his only criminal conviction in the four cases he faces, is set for July 11. The judge can sentence the former president to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. Bannon pointed to Trump allies such as Roger Stone and Rudy Giuliani who have been prosecuted and claimed, \u201cthey\u2019re turning people into political prisoners and sending people to prison, and they will send every one of you in this audience to prison also.\u201d Bannon told the crowd they are the \u201cvanguard of this revolution,\u201d adding, \u201cwe are not prepared to be governed by criminals\u201d and vowing to \u201cpurge\u201d the Justice Department and \u201ctake apart\u201d the FBI. \u201cNovember 5 is judgment day. January 20, 2025, will be accountability day,\u201d Bannon said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/bannon-turning-point-trump-retribution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_trump-campaign-turning-point-charlie-kirk", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is taking a vastly different approach to\u00a02024\u00a0compared with\u00a02020,\u00a0with plans\u00a0for fewer staff and expenses, including what the campaign views as superfluous brick-and-mortar\u00a0offices. Instead,\u00a0the campaign pledges\u00a0to run\u00a0a more efficient operation that will lean heavily on data modeling, microtargeting and relying on wealthy conservative groups for\u00a0data, infrastructure\u00a0and significant bank accounts to help find Trump a pathway to the 270\u00a0electoral votes\u00a0needed to secure victory in November. \u201c(The) ability to work with outside groups on field work alleviates the need to have the same size staff footprint as in previous cycles, allowing us to retain a greater share of resources for advertising and paid voter contact programs than in past cycles,\u201d a senior Trump adviser told CNN. Of those groups, perhaps one of the most important is Turning Point Action, which is hosting Trump in Michigan on Saturday. It will be his second engagement with the organization in\u00a0as many\u00a0weeks. Turning Point\u00a0was one of several groups that sat down with campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and James Blair during a donor retreat earlier in the year that focused on how outside groups could best assist Trump\u2019s reelection effort. TPA \u2014 an affiliate of Turning Point USA, the youth organization started by Trump ally Charlie Kirk \u2014 is aiming to ultimately spend $108 million on a get-out-the-vote effort in key battleground states, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\u00a0The \u201cChase the Vote\u201d program has built out infrastructures in Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states that Trump won in 2016 but\u00a0lost to President Joe Biden in 2020.\u00a0While Trump speaks to the crowd\u00a0this weekend,\u00a0the group is planning to sign up more local volunteers as well as pass out job applications to beef up their program, particularly in the Wolverine State. Democratic operatives have mocked Trump\u2019s campaign for their limited hired staff on the ground, as Biden\u2019s team has continued to build out\u00a0its own\u00a0massive ground game operation. \u201cYou need boots on the ground to win an election,\u201d said one veteran Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201c(The Biden campaign) is far outpacing Trump\u2019s operation on this front.\u201d But Trump\u2019s team members insist they do have people on the ground \u2014 they just aren\u2019t all paid by the campaign. The TPA program is built around \u201crelational organizing,\u201d a form of community organizing that requires hired \u201cballot chasers,\u201d full-time staff who are trained to build relationships with specific members of the community and ensure they vote in the upcoming election. Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, TPA\u2019s chief operating officer, created the program after Republicans faced major losses in the 2022 election. Using data from the last several election cycles, TPA has identified thousands of right-leaning low propensity voters \u2014 including voters who have voted for a Republican in recent cycles, but did not cast a ballot in 2020 or 2022 and cannot be relied on to show up in November.\u00a0Many of these voters are in Republican districts. \u201cThe prevailing wisdom of the consultant class before was, \u2018Let\u2019s go to those swing districts and really try and move those voters.\u2019 Well, we don\u2019t agree,\u201d one source familiar with the plans told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going where the Republicans are. We\u2019re going to drive up score in those areas and get the people that stayed home in 2020 or 2022.\u201d Ballot chasers are hired locally and given a list of 400 to 600 of these voters that they are responsible for getting to the polls this cycle however they can, within the law of the state \u2014 including driving them to cast their ballots, helping mail their ballots and encouraging early voting. \u201cWe want them to be the mayor of their territory,\u201d\u00a0TPA spokesman\u00a0Andrew Kolvet said. \u201cThey\u2019re throwing BBQs in the park, they\u2019re getting to know their neighbors, they\u2019re hosting local events so that when voting month comes along, they already have a relationship with these individuals so they can get as many pieces of paper in the ballot box as they can.\u201d \u201cThe 2020\u00a0election was decided by a handful of voters in three states. TPA plans to engage with hundreds of thousands of voters in these states,\u201d Kolvet added. The approach\u00a0of relying\u00a0on outside groups is untested.\u00a0Advisers said this would be unlike any other traditional campaign strategy in modern history \u2014 only made possible by a recent Federal Election Commission ruling that allows campaigns to directly work and coordinate with outside groups.\u00a0It\u2019s also born out of a crucial challenge the Trump campaign has yet to solve for: money. Trump\u2019s campaign has struggled for months to keep pace with Biden\u2019s growing war chest amid the former president\u2019s ever mounting legal fees. Republican operatives described the effort as valiant but risky. \u201cYou are placing a lot of a trust in these (outside groups), who might be hard to manage,\u201d said one operative, who spoke on condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. A former RNC official who also requested anonymity to speak candidly said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a presence being built up, they don\u2019t have a footprint. They have a handful of staffers in the states.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a messaging war,\u201d the former official said.\u00a0\u201cThis is going to be a turnout fight \u2026 when you don\u2019t have people out there building relationships and you don\u2019t have the intense infrastructure, you don\u2019t have as many offices, you don\u2019t have as many bodies. \u2026 It seems that they are miscalculating how this election is going to be won.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-campaign-turning-point-charlie-kirk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_nato-agreement-ukraine-aid", "text": "NATO defense ministers are expected to finalize an agreement on Friday that will give\u00a0the alliance\u00a0greater control over security assistance and training for Ukraine\u2019s military, an attempt some officials say is meant to give Europe greater responsibility over the aid amid uncertainty\u00a0over the outcome of the US presidential election this fall. The possibility that former President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of providing US military support to NATO and Europe, could win the election \u201cis a huge part\u201d of why NATO is moving forward with the consolidation plan, said one official familiar with the discussions. It is also a way to give Europe more responsibility\u00a0over\u00a0the training and equipping of Ukraine as the extent of the\u00a0US\u2019 commitment to supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia\u00a0after the election remains unclear, the official said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the intent in a news conference on Thursday, saying NATO provides \u201cmore than 99% of all military support to Ukraine \u2026 so it makes sense that NATO takes on a greater role in these efforts.\u201d \u201cThis will put our support on a firmer footing, provide predictability for Kyiv, and address both immediate and long-term needs,\u201d Stoltenberg said. A US defense official and European diplomat added that the effort will be headquartered in Wiesbaden, Germany and fall under NATO command, led by a three-star general reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen. Chris Cavoli, who is also the head of US European Command. Earlier in the day on Thursday, Stoltenberg said the \u201cwhole idea\u201d of the new framework was to \u201cminimize the risk for gaps and delays\u201d \u2014 particularly after a months-long delay by the US in providing additional security aid had real negative impacts on Ukraine\u2019s ability to fight Russia. \u201cThe whole idea is to minimize the risk for gaps and delays as we saw earlier this year, because the gaps in delays in both the provision of military support from the United States but also from several European allies, made a difference on the battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one of the reasons why the Russians are now able to push and to actually occupy more land in Ukraine.\u201d Stoltenberg also said Thursday that he has proposed NATO allies provide Ukraine a minimum of 40 billion euros a year \u201cfor as long as it takes\u201d \u2014 a number that he said allies have already approximately provided annually since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022. Ukraine needs the annual funds \u201cto ensure they have the resources to repel Russian aggression against their country,\u201d he said. CNN previously reported the options around ensuring long-term support for Ukraine, which one senior European diplomat described at the time as \u201cfuture-proofing.\u201d A senior US Defense Department official told reporters on Thursday it was important to ensure that the capabilities and troops assisting Ukraine is being done with \u201can eye \u2026 towards NATO interoperability and integration.\u201d \u201cRight now it\u2019s pretty ad hoc,\u201d the official said. \u201cA nation raises its hand and says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the artillery coalition,\u2019 another says, \u2018I\u2019ll do the drone coalition\u2019 \u2014 who\u2019s actually sitting down and mapping these things out and making sure that that force that\u2019s being built is going to make sense to deter and defend against what Ukraine needs to deter and defend against? Who\u2019s thinking through the extent to which that force is interoperable with Polish forces, for example. Earlier this week, the plan to centralize the alliance\u2019s military support for Ukraine overcame a major hurdle when Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said that while Hungary will not participate in the scheme, it will not veto it. \u201cThe prime minister has assured me that Hungary will not oppose these efforts, enabling other allies to move forward, and he has confirmed that Hungary will continue to meet its NATO commitments in full,\u201d Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group and NATO defense ministers\u2019 meetings are happening in Brussels as a Group of Seven nations summit in Italy is taking place, where support for Ukraine remains a top issue. Leaders of G7 nations have agreed to loan Ukraine money backed by profits from frozen Russian investments. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that the loan amount totals roughly $50 billion, which is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024 \u2014 before a potential change in US administrations. The US and Ukraine are also\u00a0expected to sign\u00a0a long-term security agreement at the G7 summit, after months of negotiations, but could ultimately be undone by a new administration.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/nato-agreement-ukraine-aid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Both the US Treasury Department and the US State Department took action against the Tzav 9 movement for its repeated obstruction of the aid. The sanctions against the organization are the latest punitive measure taken under an executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank. They come as the US continues to grapple with the crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian officials say the situation has reached one of its lowest points in the entire\u00a0eight-month\u00a0conflict The Tzav 9 movement, a grouping of demobilized reservists, families of hostages and settlers, has been\u00a0leading protests\u00a0to disrupt the critical aid convoys at\u00a0Kerem Shalom, the country\u2019s sole functioning border crossing with Gaza. Its name, meaning \u201cOrder 9,\u201d is a reference to the emergency mobilization notices that call up reservists. At the end of February, the area was declared a closed military zone, due to international pressure, but protesters continued to arrive and try to outmaneuver the police. \u201cFor months, individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently, along their route from Jordan to Gaza, including in the West Bank,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Friday. \u201cThey also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\u00a0 On May 13, 2024, Tzav 9 members looted and then set fire to two trucks near Hebron in the West Bank carrying humanitarian aid destined for men, women, and children in Gaza,\u201d he said. Miller said the\u00a0Israeli government\u00a0\u201chas a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian convoys transiting Israel and the West Bank enroute to Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe will not tolerate acts of sabotage and violence targeting this essential humanitarian assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to use all tools at our disposal to promote accountability for those who attempt or undertake such heinous acts, and we expect and urge that Israeli authorities do the same.\u201d In a statement Friday, Tzav 9 described the Biden administration\u2019s imposition of sanctions as \u201cshocking,\u201d\u00a0adding,\u00a0\u201cIt is a fatal blow to the families who aim to stop the aid to the enemy Hamas in time of war.\u201d The statement also accused the Biden administration of acting \u201cagainst the families of hostages who fight to get their loved ones back from Hamas\u2019s hands.\u201d The statement claimed without evidence that aid \u201cfalls directly into the hands of the terrorist organization Hamas.\u201d The US and humanitarian aid organizations say they are not aware of widespread diversion of humanitarian assistance by Hamas. Reuters first reported that the sanctions were being imposed. President Joe Biden signed an executive order earlier this year allowing sanctions on those causing West Bank violence. The order has been used to roll out sanctions on Israeli settlers attacking Palestinians in recent months.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_harris-white-house-event", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to host a White House event focused in part on the Israel-Hamas war on Monday as part of an effort to highlight conflict-related sexual violence and amid fraught negotiations to reach a ceasefire agreement. Harris has forcefully spoken about the situation unfolding in Gaza \u2013 notably, in remarks in Selma, Alabama, this year \u2013 and acknowledged the heightened emotions surrounding the humanitarian crisis in the region. But Monday\u2019s event also comes as the administration has publicly placed enormous pressure on Hamas to accept a hostage and ceasefire proposal and heightened its rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war. Planning for the event had been underway for months, according to a source familiar.\u00a0 Harris will deliver remarks at the White House on conflict-related sexual violence, followed by a panel discussion of survivors and experts from around the world, and a partial screening of\u00a0documentary film,\u00a0\u201cScreams Before Silence,\u201d on Hamas\u2019 sexual violence on October 7, according to a White House official. Sheryl Sandberg, who led the film,\u00a0will deliver remarks before the screening. \u201cThe Vice President spent her career as a prosecutor working to protect women and girls from violence, and as Vice President, she has continued this leadership globally. The Vice President has worked to ensure that conflict-related sexual violence \u2013 and a focus on the status of women and girls \u2013 remains at the forefront of our national security policymaking,\u201d a White House official said, citing multiple measures the administration has taken to tackle gender-based violence. Earlier\u00a0this year,\u00a0the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel published a report that found\u00a0Israeli civilians suffered \u201cbrutal sexual assaults\u201d that were carried out \u201csystematically and deliberately\u201d during\u00a0Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. The report, which includes testimonies from eyewitnesses, first responders, forensic experts and news articles, says Hamas militants who entered Israel used extreme acts of sexual violence against their victims and, in most cases, killed them \u201cafter or even during the rape.\u201d According to evidence collected by the ARCCI \u2013 an umbrella organization for nine regional Rape Crisis Centers \u2013 men, women, and children were all victims of gruesome sexual abuse on October 7. The report outlines witness testimony of the brutality of the sexual crimes, including that of gang rape at the Nova music festival, in the desert of southern Israel. Two former hostages who were released in late November described witnessing and hearing about other hostages being assaulted while in captivity, according to their testimony, which the report emphasizes is likely continuing to happen to the hostages that remain in Gaza. A United Nations report also found \u201cclear and convincing\u201d information that hostages in Gaza were sexually abused and there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe the sexual violence is ongoing. \u201cThis event gives voice to a truth we must all hold: sexual violence is never ok and we must stand together as a global community to support survivors and hold perpetrators accountable,\u201d said Sandberg, founder of Sandberg Goldberg Bernthal Family Foundation. On Thursday, President Joe Biden said he\u2019s not confident a ceasefire deal will be reached in Gaza soon. \u201cNo,\u201d Biden said when asked if he was confident in a deal, which he said he discussed with world leaders at the G7 summit in Italy. Still, he added: \u201cI haven\u2019t lost hope.\u201d The US-backed Israeli proposal for a\u00a0ceasefire and hostage deal\u00a0appeared to be in limbo Thursday, with neither side yet publicly committing to the plan.\u00a0Biden on Thursday called on the Hamas terror group to step up.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/harris-white-house-event/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The attorneys continued, comparing the request to the gag order Trump is under in a separate case in New York, adding, \u201cLike Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Smith seeks to restrict President Trump\u2019s campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month.\u201d In late May, attorneys for Smith asked the judge presiding to \u201cmake clear\u201d that Trump cannot \u201cmake statements that pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents participating in the investigation and prosecution of this case.\u201d The heart of their concern, prosecutors wrote, was Trump\u2019s \u201cfalse and inflammatory statements\u201d when he claimed that FBI agents were ready to shoot him and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d during the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. The former president was in New York at the time. Trump\u2019s claims, based on the FBI\u2019s plan for the search \u2013\u00a0which was provided to the defense in discovery \u2013 are entirely false, prosecutors wrote, adding that Trump has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search, as the bureau does with \u201ccountless\u201d warrants that it executes. The FBI and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both said the policy is normal and was also in place during the search of President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware residence during the investigation into his handling of classified information. In the filing Friday, Trump\u2019s attorneys said prosecutors have not submitted \u201cany evidence of threats or harassment resulting from President Trump\u2019s protected speech.\u201d \u201cNot a single FBI agent who participated in the raid submitted an affidavit, or even an argument, claiming that President Trump\u2019s remarks put them at risk,\u201d his attorneys wrote. Prosecutors\u2019 original ask for a gag order was thrown out by Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, who determined that they had not fully conferred with Trump\u2019s attorneys before filing the request. Trump\u2019s false claims \u201cinvite\u201d threats and harassment against law enforcement agents involved in the case, prosecutors wrote, similar to those \u201cthat have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/trump-gag-order-classified-documents-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
