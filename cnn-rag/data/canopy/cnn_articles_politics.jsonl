Some of those\u00a0chosen to serve on\u00a0the independent panel include Janet Napolitano, a former DHS Secretary, and Mark Filip, a former federal judge and\u00a0deputy\u00a0attorney\u00a0general to President George W. Bush. The Department of Homeland Security and the White House have been closely managing how the Secret Service is handling the\u00a0fallout from the attempt on Trump\u2019s life. The independent review is an effort by officials to get ahead of\u00a0congressional reviews and hearings happening on Capitol Hill, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Over recent days, the Department of Homeland Security had been reaching out to individuals,\u00a0including some former government officials,\u00a0to\u00a0gauge\u00a0interest and select who will be on the panel. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who has faced sharp criticism in the week since the shooting at Trump\u2019s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, said the agency is \u201ceager to cooperate\u201d with the bipartisan, independent review of the agency\u2019s actions related to the incident. \u201cI look forward to the panel examining what happened and providing recommendations to help ensure it will never happen again,\u201d Cheatle said in a statement Sunday evening. In the days since the attack on the former president and Republican presidential nominee, relatively little has come out about the shooter\u2019s motive, how he was able to perch on a nearby rooftop with an AR-style weapon and why Trump\u2019s team wasn\u2019t warned about a potential threat. Republican lawmakers in particular have been upset with the lack of answers, with some calling for Cheatle\u2019s resignation. The review stems from a request by President Joe Biden to conduct an independent review of the assassination attempt. Mayorkas told reporters last week that he wanted the review up and running in a matter of days. \u201cWe are committed to getting to the bottom of what happened on July 13, and I am grateful to the distinguished members of this independent review who will bring decades of expertise in law enforcement and security operations to this important investigation,\u201d Mayorkas said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThis independent review will examine what happened and provide actionable recommendations to ensure they carry out their no-fail mission most effectively and to prevent something like this from ever happening again,\u201d he added. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_legal-experts-skeptical-court-challenge-democratic-nominee", "text": "Legal challenges to Democrats\u2019 move to nominate a new presidential candidate in the wake of President Joe Biden\u2019s unprecedented decision to drop out of the 2024 race stand little likelihood of success, election law experts told CNN. Donald Trump allies have discussed the legal implications of removing Biden from the ballot, and whether or not they have grounds to challenge the issue, one source familiar with the discussions told CNN. It remains unclear whether or not the campaign or outside allies will ultimately bring such a challenge. Nevertheless, election law scholars, as well as veterans of campaign litigation, told CNN that courts would be\u00a0unlikely to go along with lawsuits that sought to challenge the addition of a new name on the top of the Democratic ticket. \u201cAs a legal matter, it is up to the convention to nominate a candidate. And all the legal precedent is on courts deferring to the party\u2019s choice for its nominee and then giving the voters the choice,\u201d said Ben Ginsberg, a Republican campaign attorney who has served as general counsel for several previous GOP nominees. It may be at least a few more weeks until we see any Hail Mary lawsuits tested. Because Biden dropped out before the formal mechanisms that would have made him the Democratic nominee, there is nothing yet for his opponents to challenge in court and they\u2019ll face an uphill battle once they do. \u201cThe Democratic Party did not have an official nominee yesterday, and the same can be said today,\u201d said David Becker, a former DOJ attorney and election law expert who advises state election officials of both parties. \u201cUntil the delegates vote, Democratic Party rules state that there is no official Democratic nominee. There was no one to be \u2018replaced\u2019 on the ballot because there is nothing to replace yet.\u201d Explosion in election-related lawsuits Before Biden\u2019s departure from the race Sunday, prominent Republicans were raising the threat of lawsuits \u2013 perhaps in the hopes of further exacerbating the chaos that has plagued the Democratic Party since Biden\u2019s poor performance at the CNN presidential debate last month. \u201cJoe Biden was chosen after a long, small-d democratic process by 14 million people,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIt will be very interesting to see if the so-called party of democracy, the Democrats, go into a backroom somewhere and switch it out and put someone else on the top of the ticket.\u201d \u201cIt will be litigated, I expect, on the ground there,\u201d Johnson said. Becker, speaking on a press call Sunday, called attempts to get a court to force Biden\u2019s name on the ballot \u201cless than frivolous.\u201d \u201cThey are not supported by anything in the law whatsoever, and what they amount to is an attempt by a political party to put someone on the ballot who chooses not to run,\u201d Becker said. There has been an explosion in election litigation in general, especially with Trump\u2019s challenges to his 2020 defeat, and there could be political incentive for conservatives to sue. And as with Trump\u2019s criminal legal troubles, courts have entertained novel and long-shot legal theories. \u201cThere\u2019s different dimensions to this,\u201d said Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cOne is what the Trump campaign itself wants to do, versus what third parties or proxies want to do.\u201d State rules tend to accept whom a major party formally makes its nominee The timing of Biden\u2019s decision is a key factor in what happens next, legally. He made his announcement two weeks before Democrats were set to use a virtual roll call to nominate their candidate and four weeks before the convention itself is scheduled to begin. There is no longer a presumptive Democratic nominee, though Biden himself has endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris, boosting the case for putting her on the top of the ticket. The Biden-Harris campaign has also changed its name to \u201cHarris for President.\u201d Whoever gets the backing of a majority of convention delegates \u2014 whether it\u2019s Harris or someone else \u2014 will officially get the party\u2019s nomination. \u00a0It\u2019s not clear yet if Harris has that level of support among the\u00a0thousands of delegates. \u201cThe way that the rules work are they\u2019re pretty loose on the Democratic side,\u201d election law Rick Hasen told Abby Phillip on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsNight\u201d last month, noting that even if Biden stayed in, the party delegates could have legally voted for someone else. \u201cThe delegates would have the ability to choose a nominee and because this is happening before the convention there would be enough time\u201d for other candidates to campaign to be the nominee, said Hasen, who is a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. If Republicans wanted to sue over the swap-out of Biden for someone else, they\u2019d likely wait until after someone else was formally nominated by the Democratic Party, Muller said. Under the usual process, after the nomination, state Democratic and Republicans parties send to the top election official in their states the name of their presidential and vice presidential candidates, and those nominees are certified for the state\u2019s ballot. \u201cUntil that happens, there\u2019s really nothing to litigate in any of these states. They haven\u2019t made any decision they haven\u2019t accepted any paperwork. They haven\u2019t filed any names,\u201d Muller said. \u201cSo you have to kind of wait until you\u2019ve gone through a nomination process and paperwork gets filed. Somebody might try to sue early, but the courts are going say, \u2018What are you suing about?\u2019\u201d Another key issue is who would meet the legal threshold known as standing to sue and that will likely influence where any longshot lawsuits get filed.\u00a0Federal courts set a particularly high bar for standing. In state court, standing rules vary state by state, and that is likely to influence where Democrats\u2019 opponents could seek to bring legal challenges; Colorado, Minnesota, and Michigan have particularly generous approaches to standing, Muller said. Groups on the right were already looking at the state-by-state intricacies, even before Biden\u2019s announcement Sunday. However, in most states, according to Hasen, the rules \u201cessentially say, whoever is the nominee of the major party, gets to appear on the ballot.\u201d The Heritage Foundation \u2013 the conservative think tank \u2013 wrote a memo in late June through its Oversight Project that pointed to several states like Georgia and Wisconsin where it believed Democrats would run into legal issues. \u201cThe process for substitution and withdrawal presents many election integrity issues,\u201d the memo says. \u201cAdherence to the law in some states may result in that process being unsuccessful for the purposes of another candidate being on the ballot.\u201d On Sunday, the Heritage\u2019s Oversight Project posted on social media that it had been \u201cpreparing for this moment for months.\u201d \u201cWe live in an era where you file a lawsuit and then you simultaneously file a press release and see if you can fundraise off it, so it\u2019s a different set of interests for third party groups,\u201d Muller said.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_vp-shortlist-kamala-harris", "text": "With President Joe Biden\u2019s support unleashing a flood of endorsements from many prominent Democrats across the country, Kamala Harris has emerged as the favorite to take his place as the party\u2019s nominee for president. Harris immediately\u00a0received the endorsements\u00a0of many Democratic party leaders and inherited the Biden campaign\u2019s war chest. The campaign\u00a0formally amended filings\u00a0with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. Now, the conversation is fast moving around who will serve as Harris\u2019 running mate. With only\u00a028 days\u00a0until the Democratic National Convention begins in Chicago, where Harris presumably will be officially nominated, the scramble to find the Democrats\u2019 vice presidential nominee has begun. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are among the Democrats who have been asked to submit information about their finances, family histories and other personal details, two people familiar with the process told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny. They are part of a group that includes about 10 names, nearly all of whom are elected officials. Here are some potential candidates to run alongside Harris: Josh Shapiro Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was elected in a landslide victory in 2022, defeating a 2020 election-denying\u00a0far-right state senator to become the third Jewish governor elected in the crucial swing state. Shapiro, who was previously Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general,\u00a0had\u00a0been floated by Democrats as a potential presidential prospect\u00a0and is also considered a potential running mate to Harris if she is the party\u2019s presidential nominee. During a stop in Philadelphia earlier this month, Harris called Shapiro a\u00a0\u201cgreat partner to the president and me.\u201d CNN previously reported that former President Barack Obama told Shapiro directly that he\u2019s among the 2022 generation of Democrats who need to have a voice in the future of the party, according to people familiar with the conversation.\u00a0Shapiro endorsed Harris on Sunday,\u00a0calling\u00a0her a \u201cpatriot worthy of our support.\u201d The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, has placed the governor in the spotlight. His response to the death of Corey Comperatore, the Trump supporter who was killed while shielding his wife and daughter, has especially been lauded. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference a day after the shooting. \u201cAnd most especially, Corey loved his family.\u201d Roy Cooper North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leads a state that is a crucial battleground in 2024. He was narrowly elected for the first time in 2016 by\u00a0just over 10,000 votes. He won reelection in 2020 and is term-limited out of running for a third time.\u00a0He\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris on Sunday, saying she \u201chas what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity.\u201d Throughout his time as governor, Cooper has clashed with lawmakers in the state legislature, where Republicans have a supermajority, over abortion rights and voting rights, among other things. Cooper previously waved off speculation that he might be on the shortlist for vice presidential nominees if Biden steps aside and Harris becomes the nominee. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play into this new favorite political parlor game, because it\u2019s too important for America to stop Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Cooper told CNN in July.\u00a0 In office, Cooper overcame longstanding opposition in the state\u2019s Republican-led legislature and achieved one of his top priorities last year when the North Carolina became the 40th state to\u00a0expand Medicaid\u00a0to low-income adults. More than 500,000 residents now have coverage through expansion. Biden and Harris heralded the achievement during a\u00a0joint campaign stop\u00a0in Raleigh in March in hopes of winning the state. First elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1986, Cooper has been a force in North Carolina politics for years. He rose to be the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate, and won his first statewide race for North Carolina attorney general in 2000. He held the post for four terms. Mark Kelly Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly represents a state that Biden won by only 10,457 votes in 2020 and has\u00a0national name recognition\u00a0both as a former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords. He has been a reliable supporter of Democratic Party priorities while in office but has occasionally bucked his party, such as in 2023, when he\u00a0flatly called\u00a0the influx of undocumented migrants across the US southern border a \u201ccrisis.\u201d If Kelly, who swiftly\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris for president on Sunday, was elected to higher office, his seat\u00a0would remain\u00a0in Democratic hands as Gov. Katie Hobbs would be able to appoint his successor. Andy\u00a0Beshear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has been floated as a possible vice-presidential candidate. He won reelection to a second term last November in a deep-red state that Trump carried by about 25 points in 2020. He\u2019s the top elected Democrat in the Bluegrass state and made abortion a major issue in his campaign. After endorsing Harris, Beshear wasn\u2019t shy about expressing his willingness to run alongside her if asked. \u201cAre you at least open to the possibility of being a running mate to Vice President Harris?,\u201d Beshear was asked on MSNBC Monday morning. \u201cWell, I think if somebody calls you on that, what you do is, is at least listen,\u201d he replied. Beshear is one of the nation\u2019s most popular governors. He\u2019s made headlines for his leadership of the state through the Covid-19 pandemic, deadly tornadoes in 2021\u00a0and catastrophic flooding in 2022. Should Republicans retain control of the House and gain a majority in the Senate, he has experience navigating clashes with GOP lawmakers. He previously served as state attorney general before winning a narrow gubernatorial\u00a0victory in 2019, and his time as governor has been marked by disagreements over education, public assistance and tax policy with the Republican-led state legislature. His father, Steve Beshear, was Kentucky governor for two terms and\u00a0received national attention\u00a0for lowering the state\u2019s uninsured rate from more than 20% to 7.5%, one of the country\u2019s largest improvements following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. J.B. Pritzker Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker,\u00a0heir to the Hyatt hotel riches,\u00a0was first elected in 2018 and\u00a0sailed to reelection in 2022\u00a0by more than 10 percentage points. Pritzker,\u00a0who endorsed Harris on Monday morning,\u00a0has navigated a series of issues that have dominated the 2024 presidential race, from gun control to reproductive rights. He\u2019s led the state as it contends with\u00a0increased demand for abortion care\u00a0from women forced to travel from the South and Midwest in a post-Roe v. Wade era. In 2023, Pritzker signed\u00a0an extensive ban\u00a0on firearms and high-capacity magazines. He also signed\u00a0first-in-the-nation legislation\u00a0that prohibits book bans in the state. The governor, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson,\u00a0also confronted top White House officials\u00a0in October over the migrant crisis they warned was near a breaking point. Pete Buttigieg Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg styled himself as a centrist during his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, leaning in on his time as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and his service in the Afghanistan War. His\u00a0presidential run was historic: He was the first openly gay man to launch a competitive campaign for president, he broke barriers by becoming the first gay candidate to earn primary delegates for a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, and also became the\u00a0first\u00a0Senate-confirmed out LGBTQ Cabinet secretary in history. It\u2019s been an eventful tenure for Buttigieg leading the Transportation Department: he was\u00a0criticized\u00a0for what was viewed as a slow federal response to the 2023 trail derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and he has often served as the Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0leading critic\u00a0of the airline industry following flight delays and other mishaps. As a potential Harris running mate, Buttigieg would be an effective attack dog: he memorably\u00a0called\u00a0then-Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, a \u201ccheerleader for the porn star presidency,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s personal life, and has\u00a0delighted\u00a0liberals on social media by sparring with Fox News panelists. Buttigieg previewed how he\u2019d take on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d recently. He said he \u201cknew a lot of people like\u201d Vance, a Yale Law School graduate, at Harvard. \u201cI found a lot of people like him who would say whatever they needed to, to get ahead. Five years ago, that seemed like being the anti-Trump Republican, so that\u2019s what he was. \u2026 Five years later, the way he gets ahead is (Trump) is the greatest thing since sliced bread,\u201d Buttigieg said. Gretchen Whitmer Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who won reelection in the crucial swing state in 2022 by roughly 10 percentage points, was eyed by Democrats as a top candidate to replace Biden atop the ticket, though she\u00a0endorsed\u00a0Harris on Monday morning and appeared to take herself out of consideration in comments to local reporters. \u201cI am not leaving Michigan. I am proud to be the governor of Michigan. I have been consistent. I know everyone is always suspicious and asking this question over and over again,\u201d she told local reporters, The Detroit News\u00a0reported. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Whitmer, first elected governor in 2018, emerged as a prominent executive during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Her leadership decisions, which included stay-at-home orders, made\u00a0her the target of a kidnapping plot\u00a0in 2020. During her time in office, Whitmer has\u00a0also prioritized efforts\u00a0to expand affordable\u00a0access to health care. She has invested billions of dollars in the state\u2019s infrastructure and created a department tasked with improving the quality of drinking water in Michigan. She\u2019s\u00a0also\u00a0pitched herself as a staunch\u00a0defender of reproductive rights. In the weeks following the debate between Biden and Trump, Whitmer continued to voice support for the president, brushing aside rumors that she might step into the race should he withdraw. \u201cI understand that some are playing fantasy football and want to just pick a couple of random leaders that they like across the country and design a ticket. That\u2019s just not how this works,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip\u00a0earlier this month.\u00a0\u201cWe have a president who\u2019s gotten a nomination, who\u2019s earned it.\u201d Gavin Newsom California Gov. Gavin Newsom was the subject of 2024 presidential speculation last year, when he notably debated then-GOP candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Fox News and visited several Republican-led states.\u00a0He moved to endorse Harris on X Sunday evening,\u00a0writing, \u201cno one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump\u2019s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America\u2019s Vice President, @KamalaHarris.\u201d Like other Democratic governors who have been floated as potential 2024 picks,\u00a0Newsom steered his state through Covid-19. He\u00a0fought off a recall effort in 2021\u00a0that stemmed from partisan anger over his pandemic response. Newsom also received blowback for attending the unmasked birthday dinner of a lobbyist friend at an elite Napa Valley restaurant at a time when he was urging Californians to stay home. First elected in 2018, Newsom has called for Democrats to go on the offensive, calling out the GOP\u2019s stance on abortion restrictions, book bans and protections for the LGBTQ community, among other things. He was mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011. If Harris becomes the Democratic nominee, Newsom, a fellow Californian, would run up against the\u00a012th Amendment of the Constitution, which would prohibit Golden State electors, all 54 of them, from voting for a president and vice president who share the same state as themselves. Theoretically, this snag could be avoided if either Harris and Newsom changed their official residencies, potentially even after the election but before the Electoral College meets.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_kamala-harris-biden-endorsement-democratic-nominee", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris said she plans to seek the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed her, setting up a push that could make her the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. \u201cI am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\u201d she said in a statement. Biden\u2019s historic endorsement \u2014 and Harris\u2019s pledge to unite the party behind her \u2014came Sunday\u00a0after he announced that\u00a0he is dropping his reelection bid\u00a0following weeks of disarray\u00a0within the Democratic Party. The president\u2019s disastrous debate called into question his ability to win a second term and govern for another four years. \u201cMy fellow Democrats, I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as President for the remainder of my term. My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick\u00a0Kamala\u00a0Harris as my Vice President. And it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for\u00a0Kamala to be the nominee,\u201d Biden said. Still, despite the president\u2019s backing, it remains unclear if Harris will become the nominee, or what process the Democratic Party would take to select an alternative. It will now be up to the delegates to the party\u2019s national convention to choose their candidate. While Harris allies have sought to secure her path to the nomination, some Democrats have stopped short of backing her or explicitly called for an open nomination process. Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement that in the coming days the party will \u201cundertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.\u201d Logistically,\u00a0Harris\u00a0is the natural heir to the ticket as Biden\u2019s running mate. The Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee \u201cHarris for President,\u201d saying that the committee name is \u201cdifferent than previously reported.\u201d The committee\u00a0also filed a letter\u00a0with the commission stating that \u201cVice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office.\u201d Control of the campaign war chest, however \u2013 totaling $95.9 million at the end of June \u2013 depends on whether Harris remains on Democrats\u2019 2024 ticket. Recent polling has also shown her performing better against former President Donald Trump, the\u00a0Republican nominee, than Biden and other potential Democratic contenders. Should there be efforts to pass over\u00a0Harris\u00a0in favor of Democrats seen as likely to run in 2028, there may be backlash from the vice president\u2019s supporters and prominent Black Democrats. But\u00a0Harris has also experienced something of a renaissance within her party, as Democrats showered her with praise in the days following the debate. Throughout her vice presidency,\u00a0Harris\u00a0has struggled to define herself while juggling an issue portfolio that has included difficult topics such as voting rights and stemming the tide of migrants coming from Central America. On the former, an effort to bolster the Voting Rights Act failed in Congress. On migration,\u00a0Harris\u00a0was criticized on the right for not spending enough time on the border and on the left for telling migrants in a speech, \u201cDo not come.\u201d As recently as last year, some Democrats were worried that negative views of\u00a0Harris\u00a0could hurt the ticket, prompting prominent\u00a0Democrats to urge the party to stop undermining her. But in the weeks since Biden\u2019s June debate performance, Harris\u00a0has settled into a groove, becoming a key surrogate for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign on reproductive health as the campaign put it, the threat Trump poses to democracy. Harris\u00a0allies have argued that much of the criticism is a result of racism and sexism against the country\u2019s first woman of color in such a position. Now, they say, the country is seeing in\u00a0Harris what her allies have seen for years. \u201cOftentimes Black women are not seen until they\u2019re needed,\u201d said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a progressive group that works to boost Black voter turnout. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen her constantly berated, marginalized, questioned. I think that the shift is because there\u2019s a need.\u201d \u2018Uncharted territory\u2019 A growing number of Democratic officials and donors already have rallied behind Harris, including the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Democratic Senate candidates including Andy Kim of New Jersey, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. Even as Democrats waited for Biden to make his decision, Harris supporters were working behind the scenes for the last week to secure support from delegates -\u2013 not to push Biden out, but to be prepared in case he left the race. \u201cWe have been whipping delegates for the last week,\u201d a senior Democratic strategist who worked on Harris\u2019 2020 campaign told CNN. Her network of backers includes a number of key Black female Democratic allies who have been quietly organizing for weeks to ensure that she would be well positioned to lead the ticket if Biden stepped aside. Those women will meet in a Zoom call Sunday evening. \u201cThe bottom line is, we are ready to go,\u201d said Brown of Black Voters Matter. \u201cWe are grateful for President Biden\u2019s service and that\u2019s why we fought for him until the end. We are ecstatic that he has put his endorsement behind Vice President Kamala Harris. We expect the full Democratic apparatus to do the same and if they don\u2019t, they will lose this election.\u201d Harris allies are describing this moment as \u201cuncharted territory\u201d but are confident the party will be able to navigate the days ahead because Biden has endorsed her. For donors, Biden\u2019s decision to exit the race and endorse Harris represents a seismic change for the Democratic party that many are embracing publicly. Dmitri Mehlhorn, a Democratic political strategist advising several big-money backers, released a statement Sunday following Biden\u2019s withdrawal supporting Harris. \u201cKamala Harris is the American dream personified, daughter of immigrants who met at Cal,\u201d Mehlhorn said. \u201cShe is also toughness personified, rising from my home town of Oakland California to become the top prosecutor of the state. With Scranton Joe stepping back, I cannot wait to help elect President Harris.\u201d Other donors were less enthusiastic about the Harris pick. Top Biden donor John Morgan called the president\u2019s endorsement of Harris a \u201cf\u2014 you\u201d to people who \u201cpushed him out.\u201d \u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d he wrote on X. Harris\u2019s rise Harris, the daughter of Berkeley political activists and immigrants from India and Jamaica, grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California\u2019s Bay Area. After earning her law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of Law, she became a deputy district attorney for Alameda County. She later served in the San Francisco district attorney and city attorney offices. In 2003, she was elected district attorney for San Francisco. Seven years later, she was elected California\u2019s attorney general \u2013\u00a0the first woman, first Black person and first Asian American to hold the position. Harris\u2019s record in law enforcement would later become both a boon and a burden to her political campaigns for Senate and the White House. Among her more controversial policies was a truancy program she advocated, which allowed parents to be charged with misdemeanors if their children missed too many school days. Harris later said she regretted the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the program. In 2016, Harris won her bid to succeed outgoing California Sen. Barbara Boxer, becoming the second Black woman to ever serve in the US Senate. As a senator, Harris was known for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings with Trump administration officials and nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Three years later, in January 2019, she entered the Democratic presidential primary. From the start, Harris acknowledged the historic nature of her campaign \u2013 she launched her bid on the federal holiday marking Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday and held a news conference at Howard University, the historically Black college she graduated from in 1986. Harris was one of more than a dozen Democrats, including Biden, who sought the 2020 party nomination. One of Biden\u2019s worst debate moments of that cycle came when Harris blasted him over his opposition in the 1970s to court-ordered busing of students to desegregate schools. The dig from Harris, who was close friends with Biden\u2019s son Beau before his death in 2015, came as a surprise to Biden and angered some his allies. After she dropped out, Harris became a prominent surrogate for Biden before being named his vice presidential pick in August 2020. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,\u201d Biden told supporters in an email.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_trump-rnc-biden-2024-analysis", "text": "Thousands of supporters chanted \u201cfight, fight, fight\u201d and pumped their fists Thursday night as Donald Trump basked in the love of the new Republican Party he built and that hails him as a superhero touched by God. States away, Joe Biden sat isolated and sick in his Delaware beach house as the party he led to victory just four years ago turned on the 81-year-old president and the possibility grew that a humiliating final chapter may be opening in a storied political life. Trump and Biden have been locked in a bitter political clash ever since Biden vowed to launch a battle for the soul of the nation when White supremacists marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, seven years ago. Their fates diverged sharply Thursday. Trump accepted the nomination of a united party convinced it\u2019s cruising to victory in November, while Democrats splintered, with some fearing that their president could lead them to a landslide defeat after a cataclysmic debate performance sent his reelection campaign into freefall three weeks ago. Trump spoke on the last night of the Republican National Convention at the end of a week that he might not have lived to see after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt \u2013 the second stunning twist in three weeks in a suddenly transformed election campaign. \u201cJust a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended, we know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd yet here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much, it\u2019s called America,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe live in a world of miracles.\u201d As the former president wistfully told the story of the horrific moment he came under attack in a Pennsylvania park on Saturday, he displayed rare vulnerability and reflection.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here tonight,\u201d Trump told the crowd, which broke into a spontaneous chant of \u201cyes you are, yes you are!\u201d The eyes of people high in the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 arena glistened with tears as Trump described how he heard a \u201cloud whizzing sound\u201d and felt something hit him \u201creally, really hard on (his) right ear.\u201d He survived, he said, because he had \u201cGod on (his) side.\u201d Trump\u2019s aides overpromised All week, Republicans have carved a narrative of an iron man of destiny who would drag a wounded America up off the dirt, just as he rose bloodied from his brush with death and held up a fist of defiance. But Trump\u2019s aides promised their candidate had also changed in the aftermath of a shooting that wounded him in the right ear \u2014 and would respond to his new lease on life with a message of national reconciliation and unity. And early in his remarks, Trump did reach for a vision of national renewal. \u201cThe discord and division in our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.\u201d But the new Trump lasted just a few minutes before the old version returned. Soon, the ex-president was ranting about weaponized justice, claiming falsely that foreign nations were sending people from their mental asylums over the US border and accusing Democrats of cheating in elections. The ex-president then tried to recreate the dystopian atmosphere of his searing 2016 convention speech \u2013 though the comparison with the intense night in Cleveland eight years ago served to underscore that Trump is eight years older and not quite the ferocious rhetorical force he once was. In the end, it was the same old speech full of untruths and rhetoric that alienates moderates that has left Trump deeply unpopular with half of America. The once and possibly future president painted a nostalgic and idealized vision of his term and accused Biden of driving into a ditch a country he himself left deeply divided and economically diminished. And he warned that perceived weakness abroad had created great danger. \u201cOur planet is teetering on the edge of World War III and this will be a war like no other,\u201d said Trump. Clashing political messages On a night dedicated to unity, the divisiveness of Trump\u2019s warm-up acts undercut the message, hinting at the hardline authoritarian undercurrent of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement that might characterize the second term of a former president who thinks he is entitled to unchecked power. Wrestler Hulk Hogan painted Trump in the light of a developing third-world dictator wielding unaccountable power. \u201cAll you criminals, all you low-lives, all you scumbags \u2026 what you gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you brother?\u201d Hogan roared. In an election that could be won by invigorating the Republican base \u2014 with the help of new MAGA favorite JD Vance as his vice presidential nominee \u2014 Trump\u2019s stark speech may serve its function. But it was hard to see how it would please swing voters and its tedious length, at 1 hour 32 minutes, stretched well past primetime. And for the Americans wondering how to pay for health care, how to afford a house or to send their kids to college, Trump offered no new details of what he\u2019d actually do in a second term. Trump\u2019s low-energy delivery in the vast arena was far less compelling that many of his campaign rallies, and it represented the most undisciplined, off-script moments of the entire convention. To be fair, he just survived an assassination attempt. But at times, in an election that is increasingly turning on the vulnerabilities of Biden\u2019s age, Trump looked every bit of his 78 years \u2013 and his rambling remarks could serve to embolden Democrats who believe that a more vigorous candidate on their side could thwart the ex-president\u2019s hopes of becoming only the second defeated one-term president to return to office. Still, in an age of social media and viral moments, it may not matter much that Trump went on so long. The most striking moments of the night \u2013 the ex-president\u2019s grand entrance against a huge backdrop of lights reading \u201cTrump,\u201d his scripted recollections of the assassination attempt and video of the ex-president huddled with his grandchildren in his box may be all that most Americans remember \u2013 and represented valuable imagery for a campaign that is already ahead. But there was also plenty for Democrats to fault and work with. And combined with Biden\u2019s troubles, the second half of the speech may have served best to illustrate one of the defining characteristics of the election: Americans are deeply unimpressed with either option. Biden\u2019s campaign tips into deepening crisis The speech followed a day of extraordinary developments in Biden\u2019s ailing reelection campaign, which has foundered since his faltering debate performance that validated the concerns of millions of voters who doubt he\u2019s fully fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Compounding his political woes, Biden this week has been forced to retreat to his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with a case of Covid-19, at a moment when many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials have come to believe the president must abandon his campaign for a second term. \u201cThe next 72 hours are big,\u201d one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on much longer.\u201d \u201cPeople see and feel the walls closing in,\u201d one senior Democrat said, CNN also reported. Another top Democrat close to the White House described Biden as having become \u201cexceptionally insulated and isolated\u201d since the\u00a0CNN debate in Atlanta on June 27. In a critical sign of the party\u2019s down-ballot concerns, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who faces the toughest reelection of any incumbent, became the latest senior Democrat to say Biden should step aside. \u201cI have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong. And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.\u201d Biden has argued that he\u2019s still the best Democratic hope to beat Trump \u2013 and, on the evidence of a keynote convention address on Thursday, the ex-president indeed looks beatable. But increasingly, events suggest that \ufeffthe mission may be entrusted to another, yet-to-be identified Democrat.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_wisconsin-voters-biden-debate", "text": "Lisa Reissmann had to stop watching. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem as strong as what he has been in the past,\u201d she said of President Joe Biden\u2019s performance last month at the CNN debate. \u201cI was really having a hard time watching it. Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this. You know what I mean?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/wisconsin-voters-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick Ohio Sen. JD Vance was once a fervent critic of the former president. In private messages, he wondered ahead of Trump\u2019s election whether he was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and in 2017 said the then-president\u00a0was a\u00a0\u201cmoral disaster.\u201d In public, he agreed Trump was a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d who didn\u2019t care about regular people and called him \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler,\u201d Vance wrote in a message to a friend\u00a0in 2016. \u201cHow\u2019s that for discouraging?\u201d In 2016 and 2017, Vance, then best-known for penning the best-selling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d said Trump was \u201ccultural heroin\u201d and \u201cjust another opioid\u201d\u00a0for Middle America. He told CNN ahead of the 2016 election that he was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d voting for Trump and he also contemplated voting for Hillary Clinton (he ultimately said he planned to vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin.) \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us,\u201d\u00a0he tweeted\u00a0after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape was published in 2016. Vance also\u00a0liked tweets\u00a0that said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a deleted-tweet. Trump\u2019s vice president announcement on Monday caps a dramatic reversal on Vance\u2019s part. He made his most critical remarks when he was promoting his memoir\u00a0\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0which was published in 2016. The book had catapulted him to fame as a \u201cTrump whisperer,\u201d capable of explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to the White working class. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna vote for Trump\u00a0because I think that he\u2019s projecting very complex problems onto simple villains,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper ahead of the 2016 election. But by 2020, Vance fully embraced Trump, telling podcaster Megyn Kelly after the election he voted for him. A year\u00a0later,\u00a0Vance announced he was running for Senate in Ohio and vied for Trump\u2019s endorsement, which he ultimately received. But at the beginning of that campaign, Vance was\u00a0forced to apologize\u00a0after CNN resurfaced old tweets from the 2016 campaign and early in 2017 in Trump\u2019s administration that he had deleted. \u201cI did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance told Fox News\u00a0in 2021.\u00a0 In a\u00a0statement to CNN last month, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d for changing his mind on\u00a0the former president. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Vance won his Senate race in 2022 by\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0\u2013 less than the\u00a08.1 percentage points Trump\u00a0won the state\u00a0by\u00a0in 2020. Vance\u2019s remarkable political evolution underscores the broader trend of realignment in the country and the GOP as the party becomes one of\u00a0working-class\u00a0White\u00a0voters. \u2018I\u00a0don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks\u2019 In comments promoting his book, Vance often said Trump played\u00a0to\u00a0or exploited\u00a0White\u00a0working-class\u00a0voters\u2019 fears and prejudices. \u201cAnd I cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud,\u201d\u00a0one radio host said\u00a0to Vance when promoting his book in 2016. \u201cI think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people.\u201d \u201cI do too. And it\u2019s like you, like you said, I, I agree with you on Trump because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored.\u201d In\u00a0September 2016, Vance argued Trump\u2019s immigration policies like the \u201cgreat Mexican Wall,\u201d were overly simplistic and aimed to give folks something to latch on to. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Vance also argued in 2016 that if White working-class people attended church, they would not be as attracted to Trump. \u201cI think Trump provides that sense of community that many in the White working class would have, if they actually went to church,\u201d Vance\u00a0told\u00a0New York public radio. \u201cI think if folks went to church a little bit more, they may not be as excited or as attracted to the sort of social experience that Trump provides.\u201d Vance once said racism played a role in Trump support Vance also said that racism and xenophobia played a role in Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cThere is definitely an element of Donald Trump\u2019s support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia, but a lot of these folks are just really hardworking people who are struggling in really important ways,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in a September 2016\u00a0\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d\u00a0Interview. \u201cDefinitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in an interview at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. Speaking with CNN in October 2016, Vance criticized Trump for\u00a0\u201cactively antagonizing\u201d\u00a0Black voters, claiming this tactic was a long-standing Republican strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak to issues of special concern of minority voters or Black voters, it\u2019s that he seems to like actively antagonizing a lot of the Black voters,\u201d Vance\u00a0said during a panel discussion. In a July 2016 interview with American Conservative, a right-leaning publication, he added Trump was making the problem of racial resentment \u201cworse\u201d by talking about \u201crapist immigrants and banning all Muslims\u201d as part of his message. To that end \u2013 Vance once tweeted he found Trump reprehensible. \u201cTrump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\u201d\u00a0he wrote in October 2016.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_democrats-biden-harris-endorsement", "text": "Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill is currently not weighing in on whether Vice President Kamala Harris should be the party\u2019s presidential nominee to avoid the appearance that they are forcing her candidacy onto the\u00a0voters too quickly, according to two sources familiar with their thinking. In the hours since President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection and endorsed Harris to succeed him, dozens of Democratic lawmakers have publicly stated their support for\u00a0Harris to become the nominee. But key party leaders have not yet done the same, and some Democratic lawmakers have called for an open process to determine the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democratic Party leaders now face a delicate balancing act as they hope to see their party unify behind a new nominee without alienating any factions after Biden\u2019s historic decision upended the presidential race. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries both praised Biden in statements following the president\u2019s announcement but did not explicitly mention Harris. \u201cJoe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader, but he is a truly amazing human being,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cHis decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.\u201d Jeffries, in a statement, called Biden \u201cone of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history,\u201d and said, \u201cAmerica is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful.\u201d Former President Barack Obama similarly lauded Biden but did not mention Harris. \u201cWe will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d Obama said in a statement. Many prominent Democrats, however, have been quick to voice their support for Harris. Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, who is president pro tempore of the Senate, said she respects Biden\u2019s \u201cwillingness to pass the torch\u201d and went on to endorse Harris for president. \u201cWe must beat Donald Trump \u2014 and I know Kamala Harris can win. I am behind Vice President Harris one-hundred percent \u2014 she is exactly the woman we need to prosecute the case against Donald Trump, save American democracy, lead the fight to restore abortion rights, and build an economy that puts working people \u2014 not billionaires \u2014 first. I will do everything I can to help elect Kamala Harris as our next President,\u201d she said in a statement. Rep. Ted Lieu, vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, also endorsed Harris on Sunday. \u201cFour years ago, I was the first Member of Congress to endorse Kamala Harris for President,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cSo honored to endorse @KamalaHarris again for President.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina also endorsed Harris for president. Referring to Biden, he said, \u201cI echo the good judgement he demonstrated in selecting Vice President Harris to lead this nation alongside him, and I am proud to follow his lead in support of her candidacy to succeed him as the Democratic Party\u2019s 2024 nominee for President.\u201d Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal endorsed Harris. And in a statement by Reps. Gregory Meeks of New York and Steven Horsford of Nevada, the Congressional Black Caucus PAC endorsed Harris as the next Democratic nominee for president. \u201cShe has been instrumental in delivering the accomplishments of the last 3.5 years and has led on lowering maternal mortality rates, protecting reproductive freedoms, and ensuring economic opportunities for all,\u201d they wrote in a statement. \u201cShe will do an excellent job as President of the United States.\u201d At the same time, some congressional Democrats are calling for an open process to select a new nominee. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, who was the first Democrat in Congress to call on Biden to step aside,\u00a0said in a statement, \u201cI continue to urge a fair, open, and democratic process to select the nominee best able to convince battleground voters to reject Trump\u2019s dark, retribution-fueled plans.\u201d \u201cWhile, with President Biden\u2019s endorsement, Vice President Harris is clearly the leading candidate, we should be open to all talented individuals who wish to be considered.\u201d CNN\u2019s Aileen Graef and Owen Dahlkamp contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_fec-biden-harris-campaign-account", "text": "The Biden-Harris campaign on Sunday formally amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Kamala Harris a candidate for president. The move means that should she remain on the ticket for the general election, according to the Campaign Legal Center, Harris could assume control of the Biden-Harris campaign account, which had nearly $96 million cash in hand at the end of June. \u201cSpecifically, because Biden and Harris share a campaign committee, the Vice President and her running mate can continue using the campaign\u2019s existing funds for the general election if she is on the Democratic ticket as either the presidential or vice-presidential nominee,\u201d Trevor Potter, founder and president of Campaign Legal Center,\u00a0said in a statement. Just hours after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, the campaign committee filed\u00a0paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, which noted that the \u201ccommittee name is different than previously reported,\u201d re-designating the committee as \u201cHarris for President.\u201d The committee also filed a letter with the commission stating that \u201cVice President Harris is now a candidate for United States President in the 2024 election and will henceforth be conducting campaign activities only in pursuit of that office.\u201d The ability to change the FEC filing was one reason why many political observers felt Harris would be practical replacement for Biden since her name was already on the campaign account. Both a longtime conservative election law expert at the Heritage Foundation, Hans von Spakovsky, and Federal Election Commissioner Dara\u00a0Lindenbaum\u00a0have publicly said Harris could access what Biden raised through his principal campaign committee, because it is registered for both the president and vice president. Lindenbaum, a\u00a0Democrat\u00a0seen as a swing vote on the often-deadlocked commission, wrote on X, \u201cIf Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic Party nominee, she gets access to the Joe Biden campaign funds.\u201d A different general election Democratic presidential nominee than Harris wouldn\u2019t be able to access that cash as easily,\u00a0von Spakovsky wrote on Fox News. He added that there\u2019s no requirement that any donations be returned, although the campaign could always choose to do so. But in this unprecedented time, there\u2019s no guarantee there won\u2019t be questions over the money that was raised for the general election account since Biden will no longer be at the top of the ticket. For instance, Sean Cooksey, the current FEC chairman, who is a Republican appointee, wrote\u00a0in an X post\u00a0that a campaign finance regulation says\u00a0that\u00a0donations may need to be returned or refunded to donors, but did not elaborate or address the issue of Harris already being on the campaign account. \u201cIt is going to be a challenge,\u201d Craig Engle, a former lawyer for an FEC commissioner who represents Republican candidates and Democratic groups in the 2024 election cycle, said on Sunday. \u201cA campaign cannot keep money for an election the candidate isn\u2019t running in.\u201d Engle said there\u2019s a \u201cgray area\u201d on whether Biden could send\u00a0money\u00a0back to his general election donors and encourage them to give it immediately back to Harris. It\u2019s possible the Biden campaign will need to ask the Federal Election Commission for guidance, in the form of an advisory opinion, in the coming weeks, Engle added. Another option would be for Biden to transfer the campaign account\u2019s balance to the Democratic National Committee or to a super PAC. That could allow Harris to start a new campaign account, revisit donors who had already maxed out\u00a0contributions\u00a0to the Biden-Harris campaign and hit them up again, one election attorney said. Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said campaigns are often well ahead spending money before the FEC or courts decide what\u2019s allowed, pushing the final answers until after Election Day. \u201cI think there\u2019s going there\u2019s going to be litigation about it,\u201d Muller told CNN. \u201cI think the general consensus view is, because Harris\u2019s name is already on the paperwork, she can accept it for the general election. [But] it\u2019s not the universal view.\u201d The FEC hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment from CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_election-biden-harris-what-matters", "text": "Another week, another shock to the 2024 presidential election. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris raised a large number of questions. For starters, Biden won the Democratic primary in every state that conducted one. Can he just step aside? Is he picking Harris as his replacement, or do the people get a say? CNN asked for your questions about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve picked out a representative sampling and tried to answer with what we know based on CNN\u2019s reporting and polling. See below. You\u2019re right. Harris is not the nominee and she wasn\u2019t a candidate during the monthslong primary process. However, with Biden out of the race, the delegates he won are free to support any declared candidate recognized by the party at the convention in Chicago in August. Just hours after Biden withdrew from the race, Harris filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to become a candidate for president, which would allow her to  get signatures to be recognized at the convention. An avalanche of Democrats have already endorsed her, so while it is possible another candidate jumps in the ring and challenges her at the convention, at the moment that seems unlikely. There is a process; it\u2019s just currently being dominated by Harris. This is an unprecedented event. Biden is the first president to bow out of a reelection campaign after winning nearly all of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. Since there is no time to repeat the primaries in all 50 states, Democrats are primed to simply select the nominee with delegates to their convention. Biden has released the delegates to support whomever they choose, but Harris may end up being the only major candidate as the party tries to unify around her. Not currently. In order to challenge Harris at the convention, a candidate would have to get the signatures of hundreds of delegates and gain recognition as a candidate from the party. That is possible, but there are no top-tier Democrats currently saying they will challenge Harris. In fact, most of the Democrats who have been discussed as potential future candidates \u2013 people like Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania \u2013 have all endorsed Harris. Interesting idea! Other people submitting questions suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, another disaffected Republican. According to party rules, the process for selecting the vice presidential candidate mirrors the process for selecting the presidential candidate. Presidential candidates must sign a pledge that they are a Democrat and will run as a Democrat. However, it is possible that if Harris wanted to find a willing Republican, that person could quickly register as a Democrat to be on the ticket. Or Democrats could change their rules at the convention. However, it does not appear, at least at the moment, that Harris is considering a former Republican to be on the ticket. We don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve covered too many elections to put too much stock in odds predictions for elections. I will wait to see if there\u2019s any movement in polling in the coming days and weeks. In fact, some organizations that engage in such forecasts have suspended them for the time being. Polling conducted before Biden left the race suggests a tight matchup going forward. In an election featuring former President Donald Trump and Harris, there is no clear leader. Trump has 48% compared with Harris\u2019 47% in CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls, which is an average of the six most recent nonpartisan, national surveys of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards. But the election may still come down to who can win the three Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden won in 2020: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Keep an eye on those states. Harris could pick a running mate to appeal to Rust Belt voters. She can help motivate Black voters and women. But her selection may not change the underlying dynamic of a closely divided nation and a few battleground states. Technically, Biden isn\u2019t yet on any ballot. The party has not yet officially selected its nominee; that happens at the Democratic National Convention in August or in a virtual roll call before that. Biden is releasing the delegates pledged to support him, and there\u2019s currently no indication of anyone except Harris stepping forward. The state with a question mark about timing of the DNC, Ohio, already changed its law to allow for Democrats to select a candidate. Plus, there is no guarantee that a state\u2019s primary winner gets the nomination. In 2020, millions of Democrats in multiple states picked Sen. Bernie Sanders and their delegates supported him, but it was Biden who won the nomination. This year, Democrats\u2019 move to rally around Harris might make her the shoo-in nominee, but it does not preclude a challenge before the roll call vote. Expect lawsuits about this and for Republicans to keep up their complaints about the process. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said, without getting specific, that Republicans will look at ways to challenge a late replacement. But legal experts think such challenges have little likelihood of success, CNN has reported. Finally, just as the Supreme Court made clear that voters should have access to the candidate of their choice when it rejected efforts to disqualify Trump from the ballot, it seems like the court might protect the right of Democrats to field a candidate. There\u2019s plenty of time. The election is still months away. Republicans just presented their case at the Republican National Convention last week. Democrats get their turn in August. Presumably, Harris\u2019 proposals will not depart too drastically from Biden. While Trump has changed the GOP, there are many predictable divides between the parties. Democrats prize abortion rights; Republicans don\u2019t. Democrats want to act to combat climate change; Republicans largely don\u2019t. Both parties say they will protect Social Security and Medicare benefits, but neither is talking about long-term solutions. Democrats will try to raise taxes on Americans making more than $400,000 per year; Republicans have said they will try to lower taxes. Republicans, under Trump, are largely opposed to foreign aid to help democracies worldwide, and Democrats largely support those measures. Nope. This is a question that appears to be on a lot of people\u2019s minds. The former first lady is incredibly popular within the Democratic Party and in the country at large. But she has consistently swatted away any idea that she might be interested in a White House run. \u201cI will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it,\u201d Obama said in 2016. More recently, she told Oprah in a Netflix special from 2023 that politics is hard and a candidate has got to want to run in the same way that they want children and a family. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul,\u201d she said, adding she is more effective outside of politics. We\u2019re getting deep into hypotheticals here. Biden has not said anything about resigning and, quite the opposite, has promised to finish his term, which ends on January 20, 2025. If he were to resign, Harris would become president, according to the 25th Amendment. She would then pick a vice president, who would be approved by majority vote in both chambers of Congress. Johnson only comes into play in the presidential line of succession if both the president and vice president roles are somehow simultaneously vacant. There are multiple examples in US history of vacancies in the vice presidency. Most recently, Vice President Gerald Ford became president when Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974. But Ford\u2019s pick to be vice president, Nelson Rockefeller, was not sworn in until December of that year. There\u2019s nothing to keep a former president from being involved in politics, but, with the exception of Trump, they rarely do. John Quincy Adams went from being president during the 19th century to a long career in the US House of Representatives. President William Howard Taft was never a natural politician and lost the 1912 presidential election in a three-way race that featured his predecessor, Teddy Roosevelt, running as a Progressive, and the ultimate winner, Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Years later, in 1921, President Warren G. Harding would make Taft chief justice of the US Supreme Court. More recently, presidents have settled into long and lucrative post-presidencies outside of the political eye. That\u2019s a subjective assessment. There was a primary process and Democrats rallied behind Biden during that process. When it became clear he was not up to running and serving another four years, they pressured him to step aside. Now, the 3,949 pledged Democratic delegates \u2013 most of them community leaders from around the country \u2013 will join roughly 750 party leaders to select a replacement nominee. Democrats have said the process should be an open one. Only Harris has risen so far, and she has a massive amount of support among elected officials and delegates we\u2019ve talked to. Does that sound like a backroom deal? If so, you\u2019re among the large number of Americans frustrated by a primary process dominated by the two major political parties. Does it sound like a party pivoting, under its rules, to address the realization that its candidate should not continue? That\u2019s also a legitimate take.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/election-biden-harris-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_kimberly-cheatle-secret-service-director", "text": "United States Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is expected to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Monday that her agency \u201cfailed\u201d its mission during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump earlier this month. \u201cThe Secret Service\u2019s solemn mission is to protect our nation\u2019s leaders. On July 13th, we failed,\u201d the director is expected to tell lawmakers, according to prepared remarks reviewed by CNN. \u201cAs the Director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.\u201d The agency, Cheatle is expected to say, \u201cmust learn what happened and I will move heaven and earth to ensure an incident like July 13th does not happen again. Thinking about what we should have done differently is never far from my thoughts.\u201d In her testimony \u2013 alone and under subpoena \u2013 Cheatle will be forced to provide many answers to what is essentially a single question: How did the Secret Service\u2019s biggest failure in four decades happen under her watch? In the days following the attempted assassination, Cheatle has done no press conferences and very few interviews. Monday\u2019s hearing will mark the first opportunity for a lengthy dive into the security failures at Trump\u2019s July 13 rally. House Oversight Chairman James Comer on Sunday promised the hearing would be extensive and detailed. Cheatle is \u201cgoing to have about a six-hour hearing, and she\u2019s going to have hundreds of questions that she\u2019s going to have to answer,\u201d Comer said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d In his opening statement Monday, released prior to the hearing, Comer said Cheatle should resign and noted that so far, she has refused to do so. \u201cThe Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,\u201d Comer\u2019s opening statement says. \u201cThe bottom line is that under Director Cheatle\u2019s leadership, we question whether anyone is safe. Not President Biden, not the First Lady, not the White House, not presidential candidates.\u201d In the week since the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, relatively little has come out about the shooter\u2019s motive, how he was able to perch on a nearby rooftop with an AR-style weapon and why Trump\u2019s team wasn\u2019t warned about a potential threat. Republican lawmakers in particular have been upset with the lack of answers, and many have called for Cheatle\u2019s resignation. Cheatle has said\u00a0that \u201cthe buck stops with me,\u201d but there has also been finger pointing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement over who had responsibility for what and whether all the resources needed were present. She is expected to say in her remarks Monday that the agency\u2019s mission \u201cis not political.\u201d \u201cIt is literally a matter of life and death, as the tragic events on July 13th remind us. I have full confidence in the men and women of the Secret Service. They are worthy of our support in executing our protective mission.\u201d Here\u2019s what to watch for: Why wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s team told of a potential threat? The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was spotted multiple times with a rangefinder, a hunting device similar to a pair of binoculars that calculates distance, prior to the shooting. Further, police had circulated a photo of him they had taken. A source told CNN that about 19 minutes before the shooting occurred, law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks, but they could not find him until he was on the roof. Butler Township Manager Tom Knights told CNN police responded to a call of a \u201csuspicious male\u201d around the same time that Trump arrived for his Pennsylvania rally on Saturday - at least ten minutes before he took the stage for his speech. However,\u00a0members of Trump\u2019s team weren\u2019t told that law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks as they were preparing the former president to take the stage. There was also no conversation about whether Trump should have delayed his entrance, according to sources who were with him at the rally. \u201cWe would have never let him go out there if we thought there was a threat to him,\u201d one source present with Trump told CNN. A Secret Service source familiar with the incident told CNN that Crooks had been \u201cdeemed a suspicious person, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there was any indication that he was an immediate threat\u201d or had a weapon until just before the shooting. Suspicious people aren\u2019t uncommon at events like Trump rallies \u2013 even on Saturday, \u201ca guy tried to come in with a goat\u201d and a woman showed up \u201criding a horse with a giant Trump flag,\u201d and both were also deemed suspicious, the Secret Service source said. Why wasn\u2019t the roof secured? Crooks fired several shots at Trump from a roof roughly 150 yards away from Trump\u2019s podium. He fired from the roof of a building that was also occupied by a local sniper team on the second floor and served as a staging area for tactical support teams at the rally. Cheatle told ABC News last week that a sniper team was not positioned on the roof of the building due to its slope. \u201cThat building in particular has a sloped roof, at its highest point,\u201d Cheatle told ABC News. \u201cAnd so, there\u2019s a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn\u2019t want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. And so, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.\u201d If the slope of the roof didn\u2019t stop the shooter\u2019s ability to open fire, why did it stop law enforcement from staging there? Secret Service snipers, including the ones who killed Crooks, were also staged on a rooftop with a much steeper incline without a problem. Despite its location, the building also wasn\u2019t in the security perimeter. In an interview with CNN, Cheatle said the perimeter \u201cencompassed the area that we needed to secure the event that we had on that day.\u201d A senior law enforcement official told CNN on Saturday that the\u00a0Secret\u00a0Service\u00a0did not have\u00a0drone\u00a0support at the rally, though it does have\u00a0drone\u00a0capabilities generally. The source said the agency utilized counter-sniper teams in place of\u00a0drones. Were assets rejected? Trump\u2019s security detail had complained it was not being given enough resources and personnel by the Secret Service over the past two years, something the agency acknowledged this weekend. A spokesperson for the Secret Service said in a statement Saturday that the agency has not provided certain resources in the past but has instead provided other security measures including from local partners. A Secret Service official told CNN that examples of these changes included having local sniper teams in place when the Secret Service could not provide its own or having hand-held magnetometers and other measures established at certain events where larger, walk-through magnetometers weren\u2019t available. Meanwhile, the nature of an alleged Iranian plot to kill Trump also became known last week. And while there is no evidence connecting it to the shooter, it raises the question about the level of security at Trump events. Asked whether the Secret Service had increased the security it provides to the former president as a result,\u00a0the director said, \u201cWe have been doing that over a series of several months, to include on that day.\u201d Cheatle\u00a0would not, however, say whether\u00a0all elements of the former president\u2019s detail were increased as a result of the threat from Iran. What was the motive? Cheatle will be under pressure from lawmakers to deliver more about the motive behind the shooting. The emerging profile of Crooks more than a week after the shooting has left authorities puzzled about a motive for his assault. Investigators are speculating that his intentions may have been less politically motivated and more about\u00a0attacking\u00a0the highest-profile target near him. The investigation remains in its\u00a0early stages, officials caution. Still, in some ways, Crooks seems similar to the dozens of other young men who\u2019ve wreaked havoc across the US with high-powered assault-style rifles in recent years. He had few close friends, he would often go shooting at a local firing range, and he didn\u2019t seem to display strongly held views that would suggest a politically driven assassination, according to CNN interviews with law enforcement and a review of notes from a briefing to Congress. At the same time, it has been discovered that he visited the rally site twice after it was announced and may have even flown a drone over the area on the day of the shooting. How much longer will Cheatle remain director? Cheatle is a nearly three-decade veteran of the Secret Service, serving in various field offices and vice presidential details including then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s detail.\u00a0Cheatle left the Secret Service in 2021 as the Assistant Director of the Office of Protective Operations - a role she held when the Secret Service scrambled to protect then-Vice President Mike Pence from rioters on January 6, 2021. Multiple Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson,\u00a0have called on Cheatle to resign. \u201cI don\u2019t understand her decision-making process, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fit to lead at this critical time,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News last week.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_democrats-dnc-process-nominee", "text": "The Democratic National Committee is moving forward with a process that will determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee by August 7, party officials said Monday night, in the aftermath of President Joe Biden\u2019s stunning announcement Sunday dropping out of the 2024 race \u2013 and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 that has roiled the campaign. \u201cWhile this situation is unprecedented, the process we are prepared to undertake is not,\u201d Democratic National Convention Chair Minyon Moore said. \u201cWe have important deadlines to meet. We will make sure the process is fair, because, as it stands, no candidate has secured a majority of the delegates to the convention.\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison also pledged to the party being \u201ccommitted to an open and fair nominating process\u201d that \u201creflects the dedication to democracy our party stands for.\u201d According to DNC officials and a document obtained by CNN, candidates will need to declare their interest in becoming the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president by filing a formal\u00a0declaration\u00a0of candidacy,\u00a0meeting\u00a0party and legal qualifications to be president, and\u00a0gathering\u00a0at least 300 delegate signatures, with no more than 50 from a single state. The window of time for candidates to declare their interest will be short, one DNC official said, and would end by this week. Under the proposal, the DNC will share with delegates a candidate directory, which will include names and contact information for candidates to allow delegates to opt into information from campaigns. However, while the DNC intends to have a Democratic nominee chosen by August 7, exactly when virtual voting would begin has yet to be determined and would depend on factors like how many candidates are ultimately able to obtain support from the necessary 300 delegates. If only one candidate were to reach that threshold, for example, the party could move more quickly to begin the virtual voting process, the official said. If multiple candidates qualify, there would be a period of a few days for candidates to make their case to delegates. A date for the start of the virtual voting process, therefore, has not yet been set, but it could be as early as August 1. Party officials were less specific about the timing of the vice-presidential nomination, saying that while they would give the future nominee the ability to finalize the choice by August 7, the exact schedule would be up to the candidate. The rules will allow for candidates to file the necessary paperwork and to gather the signatures electronically. To win the nomination, a candidate will have to have the support of a majority of pledged delegates to the convention \u2013 1,976 out of 3,949 pledged delegates, party officials said. While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates \u2013 senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their position \u2013 will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full convention. That could be determined either by a candidate winning enough votes during remote balloting, or by gathering that many signatures. The convention rules committee will vote Wednesday on the proposed rules, a Democratic official said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/democrats-dnc-process-nominee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, said two-and-a-half years ago he was open to a national abortion ban, a stark contrast to comments he made this week where the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion should be a state issue. Vance argued in 2022 that people seeking abortions would travel from states where abortion is banned to states with liberal abortion laws, necessitating federal action. \u201cI certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,\u201d Vance said in January 2022 on a podcast when running for Senate. On Monday, the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion was a state issue, though in practice that means abortion can be banned in one state and entirely protected in another. \u201cMy view is that Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his views on abortion are going to be the views that dominate this party and drive this party forward,\u201d Vance said to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday. \u201cAlabama\u2019s going to make a different decision from California. That is a reasonable thing. And that\u2019s how I think we build some bridges and have some respect for one another.\u201d Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion, voters have consistently supported abortion rights in state measures, and the 2022 midterm elections saw numerous anti-abortion Republicans defeated. Many Republicans, including Vance, have shifted or moderated their abortion positions to align with the current political climate, where anti-abortion rhetoric and policies are seen as increasingly toxic and detrimental to election success. After Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in 2023, effectively repealing the state\u2019s six-week ban, Vance critiqued the Republican Party\u2019s messaging on abortion. \u201cWe have to recognize how much voters mistrust us (meaning elected Republicans) on this issue,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. Vance\u2019s office pointed CNN to past statements on abortion from Vance as a senator, including one from CNN last December where he said, \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\u201d He also expressed support for exceptions in the case of the \u201clife of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d Vance once supported a \u201cnational minimum standard\u201d for abortion restrictions and signaled support for a 15-week federal abortion ban to CNN before determining there was no appetite for it in the current climate. Yet in January 2022, Vance argued that while lawmakers couldn\u2019t ban abortion in the current climate, he was sympathetic to the view that a national ban was necessary. Vance proposed a hypothetical scenario where if Roe vs. Wade was overturned and Ohio banned abortion by 2024, liberal mega donor and philanthropist George Soros \u2014 a popular bogeyman in conservative circles might then facilitate abortions for \u201cdisproportionately black women\u201d by flying them to California. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here\u2019s a situation \u2014 let\u2019s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let\u2019s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity \u2014 uh, that\u2019s kind of creepy.\u201d \u201cAnd, and it\u2019s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?\u201d Vance said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sympathetic to that actually. So, you know, how hopefully we get to a point where Ohio bans abortion in California and the Soroses of the world respect it.\u201d \u201cThe left has this weird desire to conquer everything, right? So I tend to think that these balances are always a little tenuous and eventually, either on any given issue, the left is gonna win or we\u2019re gonna win,\u201d he concluded. On Monday, delegates at the Republican National Convention approved their party\u2019s new platform with toned-down rhetoric on abortion that aligned with Trump\u2019s state-based approach to the issue. The move has angered some anti-abortion groups who opposed abandoning the party\u2019s old long-standing language, including the de-emphasis on abortion restrictions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_inside-bidens-exit-from-2024-race", "text": "In the end, President Joe Biden exited the political stage in isolation. After weeks of fighting for his political life \u2013 insisting he wasn\u2019t going anywhere following a disastrous debate performance \u2013 the president\u2019s about-face did not come in an Oval Office address or a speech on the campaign trail. Instead, it came in letter posted to social media as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware. It was a low-key way to\u00a0reveal\u00a0one of the most historic decisions in modern American politics,\u00a0but time was not on Biden\u2019s side to reach a decision or make an announcement. Never before has a president left a reelection race this close to Election Day \u2013 and for\u00a024 days\u00a0it seemed as if he were stubbornly planning to ride out the storm that followed the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta. He spent the three weeks after the debate repeating that he was staying in the race against former President Donald Trump. The president dug in. He insisted he could beat Trump. His inner circle shrank to his closest aides and family. He was forced to\u00a0retreat to Delaware, where he reached a decision in the last day and a half, finally conceding that a man loyal to the Democratic Party for more than half a century was seen as a drag on the ticket. But in the end, the pressure on Biden from party leaders, rank-and-file lawmakers and donors \u2013 and the polling showing the perilous and potentially insurmountable path Biden faced amid a growing deficit with Trump \u2013 ultimately proved too much.\u00a0Described as\u00a0being more isolated than he had ever been,\u00a0Biden could not withstand the push behind the scenes and in public. The blunt reality became a chorus of voices calling for the president to exit the race, like a boulder rolling down a mountain that only picked up momentum with each passing day. The president\u2019s team wanted the June CNN debate with Trump \u2013 months earlier than typical presidential debates \u2013 to shake up a race that Biden was trailing. They succeeded, but not in the way they had intended. Instead, Biden\u2019s campaign unraveled over the course of the next 24 days. Everything the president and his team tried to do to calm Democrats\u2019 fears simply failed to shed the perception that Biden\u2019s age\u00a0was too advanced, and his\u00a0health too fragile, for him to stay in the race. With two posts on X Sunday afternoon, Biden bowed out of the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, in the hopes of quickly coalescing their party and moving past the chaos that had engulfed Democrats since the debate. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward gamble for Democrats, resetting a campaign Biden was losing with a new nominee just 107 days before the election. It comes as Trump is at his strongest point in the campaign, coming out of a completely unified Republican National Convention with a base rallying around him after the attempt on his life. How the decision was made Biden\u2019s final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone while recovering from Covid. A source familiar with the matter said the plans to exit the race began Saturday night and were finalized Sunday. The adviser said the president \u201cwas not dug in\u201d but was studying the data coming in and became convinced he would \u201cweigh down\u201d the ticket and be a complication to defeating Trump. Biden\u2019s decision did not have to do with any medical issues, a senior White House official told CNN. When Biden huddled with his two closest advisers Saturday, the information they provided on polling and where top Democratic officials stood underscored that a path to victory was \u201cbasically nonexistent,\u201d according to another person familiar with the matter. There wasn\u2019t any single poll number, wavering Democratic official or fundraiser presented in the meeting with longtime aides Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti that pushed Biden toward his decision, the person said. Instead, the information highlighted that the path back to a viable campaign had been severely damaged by declining national and swing-state poll numbers, along with party defections that were likely to rapidly accelerate. The information included polling and details gathered from outreach outside Biden\u2019s inner circle. Unlike 2015, when Biden wrote in his book \u201cPromise me, Dad\u201d that Donilon told the then-vice president he shouldn\u2019t launch a 2016 bid for president as he grieved the death of his son Beau, neither aide explicitly told Biden he should get out of the race, according to the person. Biden made clear before the end of the meeting that he was planning to pull out of the race and asked his aides to start drafting the letter he posted Sunday afternoon and preparing the plans for the rollout. Still recovering from a Covid diagnosis, Biden remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend with his wife, first lady Jill Biden. Biden did what he always planned to do before any crucial decision: He held a family meeting Saturday night.\u00a0He has spoken\u00a0to all of his family since making his decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier Sunday, according to a source. He confirmed that decision Sunday morning and, with Ricchetti by his side, started making calls to key players outside of his close-knit group of senior-most aides and family members, the other\u00a0person familiar with the matter\u00a0said. Biden consulted only a very small number of close aides on the decision. Some members of his inner circle were left in the dark until minutes before he posted his announcement on social media, including one of his closest communications advisers, Anita Dunn. Multiple sources told CNN that Dunn and a small group of senior aides became aware of Biden\u2019s announcement in the minutes before the post.\u00a0Many\u00a0rank-and-file\u00a0staff\u00a0found out when the post came out.\u00a0Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, were among Biden\u2019s debate prep team and had faced the ire of the president\u2019s family in the aftermath of the performance. A Biden aide disputed that her exclusion had anything to do with the debate, telling CNN that she, along with other top aides, was not in Rehoboth Beach, and that \u201cthe president told his aides that neither he or his family blame them for debate performance.\u201d Biden and Harris spoke multiple times Sunday ahead of his announcement, according to a source familiar with the matter. Biden also held separate calls with chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign co-chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon informing each of his decision. In Washington on Sunday,\u00a0Zients led a White House senior staff call with all assistants to the president in the midafternoon, as well as a call with members of Biden\u2019s Cabinet. Zients is expected to hold an all-White House staff call Monday morning and to speak with political appointees across the executive branch. But even his vice president, and pick to succeed him, didn\u2019t find out until the day he announced his decision. A \u2018bad night\u2019 changes the race In the end, Biden was confronting an untenable path forward: More than three dozen Democrats had publicly called for him to exit the race. Party leaders had told him he couldn\u2019t win. And the money was\u00a0drying\u00a0up\u00a0from\u00a0donors who said they felt betrayed by the lack of disclosure\u00a0around the condition of\u00a0Biden\u2019s health. \u201cI don\u2019t know one big donor who is going to write a check for $100,000 or more. And I know a lot of those guys,\u201d one major Democratic donor told CNN before Biden dropped out. Biden and his team tried to play off\u00a0the debate performance as a \u201cbad night.\u201d\u00a0He and his aides blamed the president\u2019s overseas trip. He said he would debate again and do better. And he returned immediately to the campaign trail, traveling to North Carolina the following day and delivering an energetic speech while acknowledging his debate shortcomings. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man. I don\u2019t walk as easy as I used to. I don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u00a0huddled with his family\u00a0at Camp David the weekend after the debate for a previously scheduled get-together,\u00a0during which\u00a0they encouraged him to stay in the race. But in Democratic circles, panic had already set in. The issue problem was plain as day: Biden\u2019s biggest problem with voters was they didn\u2019t feel he was up to the job for the next four years. The debate had confirmed their fears\u00a0and brought Biden\u2019s biggest political weakness to the forefront. No policy or statement or criticism of Trump could change that. Even as Biden insisted there was nothing that could convince him to get out of the race, Democrats began laying the groundwork and keeping the door open to a change. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on MSNBC, saying: \u201cI think it\u2019s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition?\u201d Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on July 2 became the first elected Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw. The following day, Biden met with a group of Democratic governors, telling them he needed more sleep and should stop scheduling events after 8 p.m. On July 5, Biden sat down for an interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos, in an attempt to demonstrate he was able to keep campaigning. In the interview, Biden said only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could convince him to leave the race, a comment that angered\u00a0many\u00a0Democrats. It was the first of several attempts from Biden\u2019s team to put the president in the public eye and quell the growing discontent. All failed to do so. Signs of trouble After July 4, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, quietly tried to gather a group of Democrats who would hold a meeting with Biden, potentially urging him to exit the race. The idea died, however, when the effort leaked. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a call with House Democrats over\u00a0that\u00a0weekend,\u00a0during which several lawmakers\u00a0said that Biden needed to step aside. On\u00a0July 8, Biden fired off defiant a letter to congressional Democrats saying he would continue his reelection bid. \u201cI am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\u201d he wrote. The calls for Biden to leave soon started coming from outside Washington. On July 10, George Clooney, penned a New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside. Even more devastating for the president, Clooney said the Biden he saw at a June fundraiser was the same Biden the world saw at the June debate\u00a0and that the president had declined since taking the Oval Office. Pelosi also continued to raise questions about Biden, declining to endorse him in an MSNBC interview the same day as Clooney\u2019s op-ed. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he\u2019s going to run,\u201d she said, even if that was a decision Biden\u00a0had already seemed to have made. Several news outlets, including CNN,\u00a0reported\u00a0that Pelosi and former President Barack Obama had privately expressed concerns about the future of Biden\u2019s campaign. On July 11, Biden held a\u00a0solo news conference on the sidelines of the NATO summit in\u00a0Washington. He opened the door a bit further to the possibility he could drop out, saying he would consider doing so if data showed he cannot win. Biden also made several small verbal slip-ups, including calling Harris \u201cVice President Trump.\u201d Earlier in the day, he had referred Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cPresident Putin,\u201d before correcting himself. After Biden\u2019s\u00a0news\u00a0conference, a handful more congressional Democrats called for him to drop out, growing the number to 15. The list included Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who said he deliberately waited until after the NATO meeting. That weekend, Biden met and held calls with various Democratic caucuses, including the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democrat Coalition. The call with moderate Democrats was tense, as Biden got into it with Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who bluntly told him that voters are concerned about his vigor and strength, especially as it is perceived on the world stage. The president responded to Crow \u2013 an\u00a0Army Ranger who served two tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq \u2013 that he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient\u00a0like\u00a0his late son Beau, but that \u201che didn\u2019t rebuild NATO.\u201d At one point,\u00a0Biden\u00a0told Crow,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that crap\u201d\u00a0in addressing the lawmaker\u2019s concerns. A brief respite from demands for Biden to exit doesn\u2019t last More Democrats had been expected to publicly call for Biden\u2019s exit that weekend,\u00a0but the chatter\u00a0came to a halt in an instant when an attempted assassin\u2019s bullet came within millimeters of killing Trump at his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. The assassination attempt turned the political world on its head, draining the public focus on Biden\u2019s\u00a0ability to govern for a second term\u00a0and turning it squarely onto the bullet that grazed Trump\u2019s ear, raising a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to shoot at the Republican nominee for president five days before he was to accept the nomination. The pause would not last. Behind the scenes, Democratic pollsters circulated memos showing Biden was on track to lose the election, and \u2013 importantly to congressional Democrats \u2013 damage candidates in ballot races, too. Some polling showed other Democrats outpacing Biden in battleground states. \u201cLose everything,\u201d was how one Democrat described a polling memo Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg had sent to Biden\u2019s inner circle. The dam reopened on Wednesday when California Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic Senate candidate and leader of Trump\u2019s first impeachment, became the first lawmaker to join the public calls for Biden to withdraw from the campaign after the assassination attempt. Schiff\u2019s place in the party \u2013 as a\u00a0potential\u00a0soon-to-be senator and close ally to Pelosi \u2013 made his voice among the most significant to that point. \u201cWhile the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden\u2019s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. Party leaders deliver a blunt message More voices soon followed. And arguably more importantly, the private pleas for Biden to leave the race became part of a public cacophony of voices urging his withdrawal. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland House Democrat who led Trump\u2019s second impeachment, confirmed that he had written a letter to Biden on July 6 encouraging the president that there was \u201cno shame in taking a well-deserved bow\u201d out of the 2024 presidential election \u2013 and making his argument with comparisons to George Washington and Red Sox pitching great Pedro Martinez. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0Wednesday that Pelosi privately told Biden that polling\u00a0showed he could not defeat Trump and that he could destroy Democrats\u2019 chances of winning the House in November. Biden pushed back, saying he had seen polls indicating he could win. At one point, Pelosi asked Donilon, Biden\u2019s longtime adviser, to get on the line to talk over the data. That same day, ABC News reported that Schumer told Biden in their Saturday meeting that it would be best if he bowed out of the presidential race. And a person briefed on the meeting between Biden and Jeffries\u00a0said that the Democratic House leader stopped short of calling on him to step aside \u2013 instead pinning the suggestion on his members. The White House and congressional officers tried to tamp down the reports, issuing statements of denial.\u00a0But the stories about the party leaders delivering Biden a message had their effect. On Friday, a dozen new Democrats released statements saying Biden should exit the race. Among them: Another close Pelosi ally, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. A source with direct knowledge described Biden on Friday as \u201cseething\u201d at Pelosi, a sentiment that only grew in light of Lofgren\u2019s letter. Donors revolt, too The public statements from Democrats illustrated one element of Biden\u2019s challenge to stay in the race \u2013 but just as important\u00a0were the defections from his donors that would have dried up fundraising in the home stretch of the campaign. Major Democratic donors were skeptical of Biden\u2019s viability, and multiple said their\u00a0concerns had received an icy reception from Biden campaign officials. \u201cHow do you think we feel?\u201d a Democratic donor close to the Democratic National Committee and the White House told CNN before Biden dropped out, explaining the mood among donors. \u201cWe all feel betrayed that they were not honest with us about his health.\u201d Two sources told CNN\u00a0on\u00a0Thursday that furious donors were also telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside. \u201cYes, that card has been played,\u201d a senior House Democrat told CNN on Thursday night. \u201cThey believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,\u201d said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to throw good money after bad.\u201d Moments after Biden\u2019s announcement, donors abruptly began reaching out to advisers, pouring in money, according to sources involved in the discussions.\u00a0In the lead-up to Biden\u2019s decision to exit the 2024 race, multiple donors had reached out to Harris\u2019 team proactively to signal they would be willing to support her if she ran at the top of the ticket, according to three people familiar with the discussions. Stubborn resistance gives way Up until the moment he dropped out, Biden and his team insisted he was staying in. Biden\u2019s team created\u00a0a\u00a0public schedule for the president over the past week that was intended to show his ability to stay in the race. On Monday, he held another television interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt, where he acknowledged his subpar debate performance while criticizing the media for focusing on his gaffes instead of Trump\u2019s falsehoods. Biden again said he had no intention of stepping aside. Biden then traveled to Las Vegas for campaign stops, speeches planned at the NAACP National Convention and the UnidosUS annual conference, and interviews with BET and Univision. Biden\u00a0told BET News\u2019 Ed Gordon that the only thing that would push him to reconsider his reelection bid would be a \u201cmedical condition.\u201d The president spoke at the NAACP conference, but before he could make his speech Wednesday at UnidosUS, he was dealt another blow: the positive Covid-19 diagnosis. The president returned to his Rehoboth Beach home that day to isolate, his public schedule shuttered indefinitely while he recovered. On Friday, Biden issued a statement that he would be back on the campaign trail the following week, while Biden campaign chair O\u2019Malley Dillon went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d to say Biden was \u201cabsolutely\u201d staying in the race. The campaign also put out a memo saying there was \u201cno plan for an alternative nominee.\u201d Biden called some Democrats over the weekend who were out on TV on his behalf. Two told CNN that the president voiced his gratitude and then his anger at those who were trying to push him out. \u201cThere was some hurt in his voice but mostly anger,\u201d one of the Biden loyalists said. Even on Sunday, Biden\u2019s team continued to publicly maintain he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a key Biden ally, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Biden and Harris\u00a0\u201chave received over 14 million votes to be our standard bearers. That\u2019s where we are,\u201d Clyburn.\u00a0The congressman\u2019s 2020\u00a0endorsement\u00a0of Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary was widely seen as instrumental in Biden\u2019s victory. Biden spoke to Harris on Sunday before announcing his decision, which came in two messages: The first saying he was dropping out, and the second endorsing his vice president to be the Democratic nominee. Biden told his senior-most team he was getting out around 1:45 p.m., and the public letter went out right around then, a source familiar with the timing told CNN. \u201cBefore that, it was all steam ahead that he\u2019s running,\u201d the same source said.

One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than Biden \u2013 he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013  would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns. Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s departure is the latest such decision in history. Johnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does. Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right. But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection. Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House. Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden had the Democratic nomination sewn up, and he chose to give it up. Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate. Roosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another. Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten\u00a0strips of paper\u00a0given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election.\u00a0The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise. Three 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats. James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said: Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents. Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president. Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction. Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876. Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_kamala-harris-democratic-nomination", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris is marching to the Democratic nomination as broad swaths of the party \u2014 including\u00a0potential rivals,\u00a0lawmakers, governors, influential labor and advocacy groups and more \u2014 line up behind her bid to take on Donald Trump. No credible challenger emerged Monday, the day after President Joe Biden had announced his exit from the race and his endorsement of his vice president. And the party\u2019s best-known governors, several of whom had been seen as potential challengers, announced their support for Harris \u2014 making clear that the biggest remaining question about the 2024 Democratic ticket is who Harris will choose as her running mate. Harris, who will hold a campaign event in Milwaukee on Tuesday, staked her claim to the party\u2019s standard-bearer role with an electric speech Monday evening, as she visited the campaign\u2019s headquarters in Delaware. The vice president informed staffers who had been working for the Biden-led campaign that they\u2019d remain onboard \u2014 and that campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and campaign manager\u00a0Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez would remain at the helm. And she laid out her case against Trump, invoking a host of the former president\u2019s scandals and legal troubles. She pointed to her time as a district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she \u201ctook on perpetrators of all kinds.\u201d \u201cPredators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump\u2019s type.\u201d In her first day as a candidate, Harris raised $81 million, the campaign announced Monday, saying it was the largest 24-hour raise by any candidate ever. The huge haul underscored grassroots enthusiasm for a shake-up to the Democratic 2024 ticket. According to the campaign, more than 880,000 \u201cgrassroots supporters\u201d donated, with 60% making their first contributions of the 2024 cycle. Democratic donation-processing site ActBlue called it \u201cthe biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.\u201d The Democratic super PAC Future Forward secured $150 million in commitments from donors in the 24 hours after Biden announced his decision, a senior aide to the group said.\u00a0The commitments came from donors who were either uncommitted, unsure or previously stalled, the aide added. Four\u00a0governors of must-win Midwestern states \u2014 Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota\u2019s Tim Walz,\u00a0Wisconsin\u2019s Tony Evers\u00a0and Illinois\u2019 JB Pritzker \u2014 have endorsed Harris. They join endorsements from Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper, California\u2019s Gavin Newsom and Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro. Many of those governors could be considered for the party\u2019s vice presidential nomination. Meanwhile, the cascade of endorsements for Harris\u2019 candidacy that had begun Sunday afternoon was accelerating on Capitol Hill.\u00a0Harris has the support of\u00a0more than 40 Democratic senators and nearly 100 House members\u00a0\u2014 numbers that had grown rapidly throughout Monday morning. A significant one came from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said in a Monday afternoon statement that her \u201centhusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top-ranking Democrats in each chamber, were set to endorse Harris\u00a0soon, according to multiple sources familiar with the decision. Harris has the support of more than\u00a040\u00a0Democratic senators and\u00a0nearly 100\u00a0House members \u2014 numbers that had grown rapidly throughout\u00a0the day\u00a0Monday. She also has the support of the political arms of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, as well as two key labor unions, Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers. And\u00a0growing numbers of\u00a0state delegations to next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention \u2014 Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,\u00a0Louisiana, New Hampshire, Maryland, Kentucky, Florida and Pennsylvania\u00a0\u2014 announced that they are backing Harris. Support for the vice president came across the party\u2019s ideological spectrum \u2014 from moderate populists, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the most endangered Democratic incumbents on the ballot this fall, to progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Democratic congressional leaders had remained quiet so far \u2014 but there were signs that could soon change. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the second- and third-ranking House Democrats, endorsed Harris on Monday morning. The hour-by-hour endorsements of Harris from Democratic governors, senators, Cabinet officials and state delegations is unfolding by design, with the hope of reaching a majority of delegates by Wednesday, two people familiar with the process tell CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a coordinated drumbeat,\u201d a senior Democratic aide working on the effort said. \u201cThat sound Democrats hear is the party uniting around the vice president.\u201d How Harris and her allies mobilized Joe Biden\u2019s 1:46 p.m. ET Sunday announcement that he would not seek a second term ignited a frenetic push by Harris to consolidate the support of a party that had been in crisis in the weeks since the president\u2019s dismal performance during his June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump. Harris knew what Biden had decided: She\u2019d had multiple phone calls with Biden on Sunday, a person familiar with the matter said. Once the announcement came, Harris \u2014 wearing a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University, workout sweats and sneakers \u2014 made more than 100 phone calls over 10 hours. Alongside her family and staff, the vice president\u2019s calls included lawmakers, governors and leaders of influential labor, advocacy and civil rights groups. Those calls included former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Clintons, in a statement Sunday, endorsed Harris; Obama did not, deferring to the party\u2019s process. Harris also called her pastor, Amos Brown III, who, along with his wife, prayed over her, the source said. She ate pizza with anchovies \u2014 Harris\u2019 go-to topping \u2014 for dinner. In those phone calls, Harris made clear that while she was grateful for Biden\u2019s endorsement, she planned to earn the Democratic nomination in her own right. That echoes the statement she released following Biden\u2019s announcement to step aside. \u201cI am honored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,\u201d she wrote. Harris\u2019 supporters were also mobilizing. Harris\u2019 chief of staff Lorraine Voles and California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis led a call Monday morning with around 350 Democratic donors, fundraisers and supporters, a longtime Democratic fundraiser and supporter of Harris for many years told CNN. The source, who was on the call, said by gathering Harris\u2019 core supporters from her previous campaigns and newly interested donors, they hoped to get everyone to \u201crow the right way.\u201d The group Win With Black Women periodically holds Zoom calls \u2014 but the one that took place Sunday evening had a different tone, with 44,000 people joining, according to its leaders. Longtime Democratic operative Donna Brazile said that she was in the process of gathering delegates to support Harris. \u201cI need all of you to sign your delegate pledge forms now,\u201d Brazile said on the call. She said voter registration and fundraising will be key in the days ahead. Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser also spoke on the call. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be in the crosshairs of Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to defend our sister.\u201d Former Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett were also among the speakers. No serious challenger materializes yet Though some Democrats have held off on announcing endorsements, no serious challenger has emerged to take on Harris for the nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which starts August 19 in Chicago. Any challenge might need to materialize even faster: Prior to Biden\u2019s departure from the race, the party had set up a virtual roll call to begin the first week of August. There are no signs at this point it intends to abandon those plans. Manchin, who had left the party earlier this year and is not seeking reelection, said Monday he will not rejoin the party and seek its nomination. CNN has previously reported the West Virginia senator was considering re-registering as a Democrat to throw his hat in the ring. But in an interview with CBS News on Monday, Manchin said he will not be a candidate. \u201cI could not believe that there was not going to be a primary process or a mini process. Other countries do it,\u201d Manchin said, adding that he believes Harris is too liberal but could be forced to the middle if she faces a challenge. New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams announced his support for Harris in an interview with MSNBC on Monday, reversing course just hours after he told CNN, \u201cthere\u2019s a process and we\u2019re going to follow that process,\u201d to determine the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cWe need real, clear, leadership, and she understands it,\u201d Adams told MSNBC. \u201cShe was in the position of looking over the border issue, so she understands some of the things that we need to do.\u201d And he offered a stirring endorsement of Harris\u2019 fitness to lead the ticket, urging advisers to \u201clet her be her.\u201d Running mate jockeying begins As of mid-morning Monday, as the swell of support for Harris continued to build, the biggest question might have been who she will choose as a running mate. Democratic lawyers are beginning their work conducting a deep, yet truncated, vetting process for potential vice presidential hopefuls, two people familiar with the matter told CNN, with siloed teams being established for the leading prospective candidates. Cooper, Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly are among the Democrats who have been asked to submit information about their finances, family histories and other personal details, two people familiar with the process said. They are part of a group that includes about 10 names, nearly all of whom are elected officials. Former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm Covington & Burling will handle vetting for Harris\u2019 running mate, a source familiar with the plans said. The audition process is also playing out in public, with Cooper and Beshear appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday \u2014\u00a0with the intent that Harris was watching. An aide said she caught at least part of the conversations. Beshear, the two-term Kentucky governor, announced his support for Harris \u2014 and said he is open to joining Harris as her potential running mate, noting it\u2019s \u201cflattering to be a part\u201d of the conversation about the vice-presidential nomination. He also offered a window into how he\u2019d play the traditional attack-dog role of a running mate. At multiple points in the interview, Beshear attacked Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who has family ties to Beshear\u2019s home state of Kentucky. \u201cLet me just tell you that JD Vance ain\u2019t from here,\u201d Beshear said, referring to his home state, taking issue with how Vance described Appalachia in his best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d Beshear also attacked Vance for past comments expressing support for strict restrictions to abortion access, while touting Harris\u2019 record of supporting protections for reproductive health care. \u201cJD Vance calls pregnancy arising from rape \u2018inconvenient,\u2019\u201d Beshear said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just plain wrong. He suggests that women should stay in abusive relationships. Now listen, a domestic abuser isn\u2019t a man, he\u2019s a monster, and no one should support anyone having to stay in those relationships.\u201d Cooper, the North Carolina governor who endorsed Harris on Sunday, also appeared on MSNBC on Monday, but deflected questions about whether he would be open to becoming her running mate. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we do keep the focus on her this week. The vice-presidential conversation needs to occur later,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI want to make sure that Kamala Harris wins. I\u2019m going to work for her all over this country and do what I can to make sure we stop Donald Trump.\u201d Whitmer, the Michigan governor, told a local reporter she\u2019s \u201cnot planning to go anywhere\u201d when asked Monday if she would accept the vice presidential role if offered. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that\u00a0\u201cobviously, if somebody asks, I\u2019d take a serious look at it,\u201d but that \u201cmy phone hasn\u2019t rung yet.\u201d \u201cIf they do the polling and it turns out that they need a 49-year-old, balding, gay Jew from Boulder, Colorado, they got my number,\u201d Polis quipped.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_biden-title-ix-protections-supreme-court", "text": "The Biden administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to let it enforce new anti-discrimination rules in schools, including protections for pregnant women and women who have had abortions. The administration asked the court in two separate requests to let it enforce some of the new\u00a0rules\u00a0starting next month while lower courts consider the legality of other rules\u00a0that were meant to shore up\u00a0civil rights\u00a0protections for LGBTQ+ students. Earlier this year, the Department of Education unveiled changes to\u00a0rules under\u00a0Title IX, the decades-old law that bars sex discrimination in schools, including sexual violence and sex-based harassment. The changes were set to take effect nationwide in August. Among other things, the new rules\u00a0would prohibit\u00a0discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions like childbirth, termination of pregnancy\u00a0or recovery from pregnancy. But a number of GOP attorneys general\u00a0sued\u00a0the administration\u00a0to block enforcement of the expanded protections for\u00a0LGBTQ+ students.\u00a0Those changes aim to curb discrimination \u201cbased on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics,\u201d\u00a0according to the Department of Education. Last month,\u00a0two federal judges in separate cases blocked enforcement of all\u00a0of the new Title IX rules\u00a0in 10 states. The Biden administration asked appeals courts\u00a0to modify\u00a0those injunctions so that they only covered the changes related to LGBTQ+ students \u2013 which were specifically challenged in court \u2013 but the courts recently denied those requests. Now, the administration has turned to the\u00a0Supreme Court, arguing that the lower courts \u201cplainly erred\u201d when they blocked enforcement of the changes in full. \u201cThe district court\u2019s sweeping injunction prevents the Department from fulfilling its statutory mandate to effectuate Title IX,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers. \u201cThe harm is particularly acute here because Title IX is one of the core federal civil rights statutes that guarantees nondiscrimination in the Nation\u2019s education system.\u201d Prelogar said that if the Supreme Court does not scale back the injunctions, the Department of Education \u201cwill be unable to vindicate the critical protections of that statute in a wide swath of the country because of an overbroad injunction.\u201d Specifically, the solicitor general pointed out that the\u00a0GOP-led\u00a0lawsuits did not challenge the\u00a0rule changes that address protections for\u00a0pregnant and postpartum students, including access to lactation spaces and prohibitions on retaliation. The states challenging the changes, Prelogar told the court, \u201cdo not contend\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0the lower courts did not purport to hold\u00a0\u2013 that\u00a0those provisions conflict with Title IX, the Constitution, or any other federal law.\u201d \u201cThe legal disputes concerning Title IX\u2019s application to gender-identity discrimination thus provide no justification for delaying or blocking the implementation of those important and unrelated reforms,\u201d she wrote. The lower-court orders blocked the changes to Title IX from taking effect in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho. Compliance with\u00a0Title IX\u00a0rules is required to receive federal education aid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/biden-title-ix-protections-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night three of the Republican National Convention included former President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and other speakers who made false and misleading claims throughout the night. Here is a list of fact checks from CNN\u2019s Facts First team. Vance\u2019s misleading claim about Trump and the invasion of Iraq Former President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, insinuated in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that Trump had opposed the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Vance said that \u201cwhen I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq.\u201d After mentioning other past Biden positions as well, Vance said, \u201cSomehow, a real estate developer from New York City by the name of Donald J. Trump was right on all of these issues while Biden was wrong. President Trump knew, even then, that we needed leaders who would put America first.\u201d Facts First: Vance\u2019s claim is misleading. In reality, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq before it occurred. When radio host Howard Stern asked Trump in September 2002 whether he is \u201cfor invading Iraq,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d In his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump argued a military strike on Iraq might be necessary. And Trump did not express a firm opinion about the looming war in a Fox interview in January 2003, saying that \u201ceither you attack or don\u2019t attack\u201d and that then-President George W. Bush \u201chas either got to do something or not do something, perhaps.\u201d Trump began criticizing the war in 2003, after the invasion, and also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq.He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004, the year before Biden did. But Vance suggested Trump had been right on the invasion itself while Biden got it wrong, and there\u2019s no basis for the claim that they were on opposing sides of the issue. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Kimberly Guilfoyle claims that \u2018Trump handed Biden a booming economy\u2019 Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and former Fox News host, slammed Biden for his handling of the economy in her speech on the third night of the Republican National Convention. \u201cPresident Trump handed Biden a booming economy and a strong nation. All Joe had to do was leave it alone and take a nap,\u201d she said Wednesday. Facts First: Guilfoyle\u2019s comments are misleading. While the economy did well during the first three years of the Trump administration, it was upended by the Covid-19 pandemic. While it had recovered somewhat by the end of 2020, there were still multiple weak points heading into 2021, when Biden took office. The US economy grew at an annualized and seasonally adjusted rate of 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020. That would usually be a great rate, but it didn\u2019t make up for a weak first quarter and terrible second quarter spurred by the pandemic. For all of 2020, the GDP fell 3.5% from the prior year, the worst decline since 1946. Also, disposable incomes fell by 9.5% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the unemployment rate was 6.7% in December of that year. The US economy shed 140,000 jobs that month \u2014 a far worse outcome than economists predicted at the time. Covid-19 infections had increased that month, prompting some states to take additional containment measures. Trump was the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered, largely because of the pandemic. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby RNC video makes outdated claim about US wages A video that played before Vance\u2019s speech\u00a0hit Biden over his handling of the economy. \u201cUnder Biden, wages are going down while prices skyrocket,\u201d the video said. Facts first: The claim in the video is outdated. While inflation outpaced wages during the first half of the Biden administration, that reversed in the middle of last year. Inflation rose sharply during the early years of the Biden administration but has since slowed to an annual rate of 3% in June. In fact, prices fell in June for the first time since the start of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, real average hourly earnings \u2013 which takes inflation into account \u2013 began increasing in mid-2023. They rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis, from June 2023 to June 2024, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about the 2020 economy Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said in his opening remarks at the party convention on Wednesday: \u201cOur economy is not nearly as strong as it was four years ago.\u201d Facts First: This is false.Four years ago, in mid-2020, the US economy was in dire straits because of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, the June 2020 unemployment rate was 11%, well over double the June 2024 rate of 4.1%. In late July 2020, the federal government announced that the US economy had just experienced its worst contraction on record \u2013 shrinking by an annual rate of 32.9% in the quarter running from April 2020 through June 2020. We give politicians wide latitude to express opinions, and many Trump supporters have argued that the pre-pandemic economy under former Trump, in 2019 and prior, was stronger than the current Biden-era economy. That\u2019s a matter of subjective debate. But it\u2019s plainly inaccurate that the mid-2020 economy was superior to the current economy. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Newt Gingrich on the war in Afghanistan under Trump Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich claimed that \u201cPresident Trump orchestrated an orderly end to the Afghanistan war with no American killed in nearly two years.\u201d Facts first: Both of these claims are false. Although Trump oversaw a deal with the Taliban aimed at the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the war did not end under his presidency. The last US troops left Afghanistan in August 2021 under the Biden administration. Moreover, there is no period of \u201cnearly two years\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency where no American service member was killed. During his four years in office, there were 45 US service member hostile deaths, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System. The longest stretch without combat deaths was at the end of his presidency, from March 2020 until he left office in January 2021 \u2013 less than a year. From CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler Former Trump intel chief misleadingly says \u2018Taliban is back\u2019 Richard Grenell, who served as the acting Director of National Intelligence in 2020, said Wednesday night that under President Joe Biden \u201cthe Taliban is back.\u201d \u201c[A]fter four years of Joe Biden, wars are back, the Taliban is back and members of ISIS have slipped through America\u2019s broken southern border,\u201d Grenell said. Facts first: The claim that the \u201cTaliban is back\u201d is misleading, as\u00a0it insinuates the Taliban ever left.  While it\u2019s true that the Taliban returned to power after the United States\u2019 2021 withdrawal, the Taliban remained present in Afghanistan throughout Trump\u2019s time in office. The US, under the Trump administration, and the Taliban signed a historic agreement in 2020 that set into motion the US\u2019 withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Officials within the Trump administration also met with Taliban representatives \u201crepeatedly\u201d in Doha for nearly a year, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said in a 2019 report. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Peter Navarro\u2019s false claims about his prosecution for contempt of Congress The same day he got out of prison after serving his sentence for contempt of Congress, former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol demanded he break the law. \u201cThey demanded that I break the law because they have no respect for it. I refused,\u201d Navarro told the audience at the Republic National Convention Wednesday, adding that the committee wanted him to betray Trump. Navarro also claimed that special counsel Jack Smith \u201cindicted and prosecuted me.\u201d Facts first: These assertions are both false. While Navarro has long claimed that the information subpoenaed by the committee was protected by executive privilege, the judge presiding over his case found evidence did not show that Trump had formally asserted the privilege. And Smith did not prosecute Navarro; the US attorney in Washington, DC, did. In a ruling last summer, prior to his trial where a jury convicted Navarro of being in contempt of Congress, US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Navarro could not argue that Trump asserted executive privilege to shield him from the congressional subpoena. Mehta concluded that either Trump himself or someone authorized to assert privilege or immunity on his behalf would have had to personally invoke the privilege for it to be validly asserted. The judge said Navarro had not put forward adequate evidence to show such an assertion when he was subpoenaed for testimony and documents by the House committee in February 2022. A jury in Washington, DC, found that Navarro broke the law in refusing to comply with Congress, not the other way around as the former adviser suggested. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand Florida Republican\u2019s false claim about electric tanks Florida Rep. Mike Waltz said Wednesday that Biden is \u201cfocused on building electric tanks.\u201d \u201cWhat do we have today with President Biden? What\u2019s he focused on? \u2026 here\u2019s my favorite, he\u2019s focused on building electric tanks. Has anyone seen any charging stations in the Middle East for Biden\u2019s electric tanks?\u201d Facts first: The claim that Biden is focused on building electric tanks is false.  The Army released a climate strategy in 2022 that called for a move toward various kinds of electric vehicles, including \u201cfully electric tactical vehicles by 2050,\u201d but that would not include tanks. And, regardless, a strategy is not a mandate. An engineer with the RAND Corporation told FactCheck.org of similar claims made by Trump regarding electric tanks in the military: \u201cWhile it may be true that an electric tank would have limited range, the Army is not planning on fielding or deploying an electric tank, though there have been prototypes of\u00a0hybrid tanks.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Florida lawmaker\u2019s claim about extremism training in the military Florida Rep. Brian Mast claimed at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that the Biden administration has distracted the military \u201cwith millions of hours of so-called extremism training.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have once again weakened our armed forces and \u2026distracted our troops with millions of hours of so-called extremism training,\u201d Mast said. Facts first: The claim that the US military has \u201cmillions of hours\u201d of extremism training is false.  While there has been training in the military on extremism, it is not millions of hours\u2019 worth. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered units in 2021 to hold a one-day \u201cstand down\u201d to discuss extremism in the military. The undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness said in a 2022 memo that \u201cdiscussions about extremist activity\u201d would be included in \u201cperiodic training.\u201d But the Biden administration has also shown an unwillingness to require more training on extremism in the military. In 2021, the White House said that while the administration \u201cshares the goal of preventing prohibited extremist activities and holding offenders accountable,\u201d it would not support the establishment of an Office of Countering Extremism in the Pentagon \u201cbecause it would impose onerous and overly specific training.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Burgum claims Biden has waged a \u2018war on energy\u2019 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum claimed Wednesday night as he addressed the Republican National Convention that Biden has waged a \u201cwar on energy.\u201d Facts First: This claim needs context. Biden has stressed the importance of renewable energy during his administration, but the US under Biden is producing more crude oil than any country ever has. The world record was set by the US in 2023, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, averaging about 12.9 million barrels per day \u2013 exceeding the Trump-era record, an average of about 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019. US production of dry natural gas also hit a new high in 2023.\u00a0So did US crude oil exports. CNN\u2019s Matt Egan reported in December that the US was exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia were producing, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. None of this is to say that Biden is the reason that domestic oil production has increased; market factors are the key driver of companies\u2019 investment and production decisions, and the Energy Information Administration has credited technological improvements in fracking and horizontal drilling technology that have made oil wells more productive. Egan reported in August: \u201cThe American Petroleum Institute, an oil trade group that has been critical of the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory efforts, noted that approved federal permits and new federal acres leased have both fallen sharply under Biden.\u201d Still, despite Biden\u2019s often-critical rhetoric about fossil fuel companies, some policy moves to get tougher on those companies and his major investments in initiatives to fight climate change, he certainly has not come close to stopping fossil fuel production as Trump has claimed. Biden has also approved some significant and controversial fossil fuel projects, including the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Ronny Jackson\u2019s false claim of \u2018record-high inflation\u2019 Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas claimed in his Republican National Convention speech on Wednesday that there has been \u201crecord-high inflation\u201d under the Biden administration. Facts First: This is false. The record for US inflation, set in 1920, is 23.7%; the Biden-era peak was 9.1% in June 2022. Jackson could fairly say there was a four-decade high under Biden \u2013 that June 2022 figure was the highest since late 1981 \u2013 but there was nothing close to a new record. In addition, Jackson didn\u2019t mention that inflation has fallen sharply since the Biden-era peak two years ago. The current inflation rate, for June 2024, is 3%. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Mike Waltz\u2019s false claim about spy balloons Republican Rep. Mike Waltz said Wednesday that there were no spy balloon incidents during the Trump administration, like the Chinese spy balloon that transited over the continental US in 2023 before being shot down over the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cWe had a president who defeated ISIS, broke Iran, stood with Israel, always stood with our allies, made China pay. You didn\u2019t see any spy balloons under President Trump, did you?\u201d Waltz said. Facts first: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.  Three suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d allowed the balloons to travel undetected. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about Russia\u2019s nuclear missiles near Cuba Whatley claimed in his opening speech on Wednesday evening that Russia has \u201cparked a nuclear missile capable boat\u201d in Cuba. \u201cWhere are we today? Russia has invaded Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve parked a nuclear missile capable boat 90 miles off our shore in Havana, Cuba.\u201d Facts first: This claim about the status of a Russian boat is false. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left.  A group of four Russian Navy vessels arrived in Cuba on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, was the first of the vessels to leave Havana on June 17. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC video falsely claims there was peace in the Middle East under Trump A video played early in the Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday night claimed that the \u201cstrength\u201d of Trump kept \u201cthe Middle East at peace.\u201d Whatley had similarly claimed in his convention speech on Monday that the Middle East was \u201cat peace\u201d four years ago under Trump. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there was peace in the Middle East under Trump is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Miller called \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites right-wing think tank without mentioning it was doing so A video played at the beginning of Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday evening attacked Biden\u2019s handling of foreign policy \u2013 and featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Defense News reports today that the US military is in decline and threats from China are formidable.\u201d Facts First: This claim is misleading. Defense News, an independent publication covering national security, did not itself assert that the US military is in decline. Rather, the publication reported that the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank had made that assertion. A Defense News article in October 2022 was headlined, \u201cUS military in decline, threats from China \u2018formidable,\u2019 report says.\u201d\u00a0The article explained that these assertions came from \u201ca new\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that each year analyzes the strength of the armed forces and the threats to America.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_al-sharpton-describes-harris-call", "text": "When the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s phone rang Sunday night, on the line was Vice President Kamala Harris, who just hours prior had received the most consequential phone call of her political career. In Sharpton\u2019s telling, the vice president sounded perhaps almost taken aback by the events of the past day. \u201cI had no idea it was going to happen,\u201d Harris said, according to Sharpton, who spoke with CNN Monday. But Harris was also emphatic and upbeat as she made clear to the civil rights activist about her new campaign for the presidency: I\u2019m going to go all-in. The tenor and contents of that conversation between Sharpton and Harris could not have been in starker contrast from their previous chat at the ESSENCE Festival of Culture earlier in the month. As President Joe Biden was hanging on for his political life, fielding growing calls from Democrats to drop out of the 2024 race, Harris had pleaded with Sharpton to stick with the president. She was, Sharpton said, emphatically loyal, imploring the reverend to continue to have Biden\u2019s back and not join the chorus demanding Biden ditch his campaign. \u201cShe kept telling me \u2013 stay with Joe,\u201d Sharpton recalled. Harris\u2019 brief conversation with Sharpton late Sunday, lasting all about a handful of minutes, was one of dozens upon dozens of calls that the vice president made in the immediate hours after learning of Biden\u2019s decision to drop out as she is looks to quickly coalesce the party behind her. Biden has officially endorsed Harris and handed off the reins of his reelection campaign to the vice president. Harris will visit Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday afternoon to meet with staff at the office that until Sunday had been the Biden-Harris campaign headquarters. \u201cOne day down. 105 to go,\u201d Harris said on X. \u201cTogether, we\u2019re going to win this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/al-sharpton-describes-harris-call/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_harris-strategy-against-trump", "text": "Kamala Harris\u00a0has\u00a0spent much more of her life as a prosecutor than as a senator or vice president \u2013 and that is exactly how she is now going to run against Donald Trump. In sessions that were quietly underway at the Naval Observatory even before Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous debate,\u00a0Harris and her inner circle had already landed on the plan to\u00a0look past whoever Trump picked\u00a0as his running mate and focus almost exclusively\u00a0on the former president. The vice president\u00a0had expected that to be part of her role making the case for Biden.\u00a0But it\u00a0became clearer and clearer over the last month that she was likely going to be making the case for herself. Now that Biden has stepped aside\u00a0\u2014 and with\u00a0even more of her potential opponents planning to endorse her by the end of the day Monday \u2014 over a dozen advisers and close allies\u00a0told\u00a0CNN they think\u00a0her candidacy will\u00a0lean heavily on her background as a district attorney, attorney general and cross examiner in Senate hearings. It is simple, they say: prosecutor versus felon. The strategy\u00a0will be a return to the \u201cprosecutor for president\u201d framework of her 2020 presidential campaign, which included her slogan taken from her days standing up in court as a young assistant district attorney: \u201cKamala Harris, for the people.\u201d In those days, her team was\u00a0stretching the rhetoric.\u00a0But this year, the GOP nominee has been\u00a0found guilty in a New York hush money trial, liable for battery in a civil case, and\u00a0faces two other criminal cases related to subverting the 2020 election. Advisers believe that this is a way not just to raise up her own life story, but to make her come across as fighting for Americans while Trump is trying to serve himself. It\u2019s also a strategy to play up attributes like strength, intelligence and toughness that are part of being a prosecutor but can also be of a commander in chief. Her supporters are raring to see\u00a0her do it. \u201cAs a former prosecutor, Vice President Harris has a lot of experience holding convicted felons accountable,\u201d said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a former primary opponent in the 2020 Democratic race who quickly endorsed Harris after the news\u00a0of Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0broke. \u201cShe was fighting on behalf of abused women. She was in the trenches against giant banks. She was out in the middle of multiple fights every day as a prosecutor and then attorney general in California.\u201d Warren noted that she first met Harris before either got to the Senate, when she was then setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the then-California attorney general was taking on big banks over the mortgage crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful juxtaposition,\u201d said Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All. \u201cHer whole career she\u2019s been taking on tough cases and tough characters like Donald Trump. Her reputation has grown from her success in putting bad guys away. And now she has the chance to put the ultimate bad guy away for good.\u201d During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina, last week\u00a0\u2013 when Harris was still publicly defending Biden\u2019s candidacy as his No. 2 \u2013\u00a0she road-tested some of the lines. \u201cAs many of you know, I am a former prosecutor.\u00a0So, I say, let\u2019s look at the facts, shall we?\u201d she said, as she compared Biden\u2019s record to Trump\u2019s on boosting manufacturing jobs, helping seniors, protecting Obamacare and lowering prices on goods. Harris has said that approach includes laying blame directly on Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state-level abortion\u00a0restrictions\u00a0that have followed. \u201cThe prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,\u201d Harris told CNN in\u00a0an exclusive interview after a campaign stop in Las Vegas in April. \u201cIt\u2019s presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. \u2026 He can\u2019t hide from this stuff.\u201d Several people involved in discussions and thinking about how she would campaign either with or without Biden pointed to\u00a0one of the few ads\u00a0from Harris\u2019 primary campaign\u00a0\u2013 before it sputtered out amid staff infighting and\u00a0dried up\u00a0fundraising. \u201cShe prosecuted sex predators. He is one. She shut down for-profit colleges that swindled Americans. He was a for-profit college \u2013 literally,\u201d a narrator says, as footage of first Harris and then Trump goes by. \u201cHe\u2019s owned by the big banks. She\u2019s the attorney general who beat the biggest banks in America and forced them to pay homeowners $18 billion.\u201d During the 2020 campaign,\u00a0under attack from progressives who said that she had been too tough on crime, Harris soon abandoned that approach at the urging of her younger sister Maya, a former ACLU official and Hillary Clinton adviser who is extremely close to the vice president both personally and as an adviser. Her fate out of her control for weeks The\u00a0past three weeks\u00a0were strange ones for Harris. As Biden deliberated, fumed and tried to squint a way\u00a0into reviving his reelection bid,\u00a0she was not part of the main conversations. She knew she was not in control of her own fate: Biden would\u00a0stick it out\u00a0despite all the calls to leave and she\u2019d have to\u00a0stand\u00a0by him, or he\u2019d decide to go and she\u2019d have to be ready to turn into a presidential candidate on a few minutes\u2019 notice. Old friends and people wanting to be new friends reached out to her and close staff. She did not answer almost any of the calls or texts or emails, and neither did they. Several who were in conversation with her said she would not even engage the topic of the presidential race at all in private, very conscious not to have leaks that made her seem like she was scheming in any way. As the clock seemed to tick down on Biden, there were clear signs that she was huddling with those closest to her. On Friday afternoon, she made a surprise stop at a new ice cream store in Washington, DC, owned by supermodel Tyra Banks, her grandnieces in tow because they were in town. On Saturday, when she stepped out of the helicopter at Andrews Air Force Base to fly on Air Force Two to a fundraiser in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Tony West \u2013 who\u2019s married to her sister Maya, and,\u00a0in addition to being a former Justice Department official,\u00a0is a longtime Harris\u00a0political adviser \u2014 was in her cabin on the flight there and back where the door remained closed. Although Harris usually comes to chat with reporters who travel with her,\u00a0typically\u00a0keeping those short sessions off the record, she avoided that the past few days, careful not to get caught with even a facial expression that might leak. Part of the reason Biden decided to seek reelection in the first place was because of his wariness of Harris\u2019 troubled start on the job, and his reservation about whether she could win was a central topic of discussion as he tried to hold on, people familiar with the conversations told CNN. Some of the frustration from people close to Harris for years was that Biden and some of his top advisers had not done enough to help boost the woman he had all but anointed as his choice for the future of the Democratic Party, keeping the spotlight too much on him. But part of what Harris had been trying to do as she recovered from her rocky start was steel herself for a day she knew could have come at any point, say people who have spoken to her. \u201cShe\u2019s always been ready, from the moment she accepted to be his running mate. It\u2019s been clear that he\u2019s older, and might not complete two terms,\u201d said Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California and a friend of Harris\u2019 for years. \u201cShe always knew that this moment could come. And she\u2019s been getting ready \u2013 very quietly, very deliberate out of respect for our country.\u201d Harris spent most of Sunday taking in the news and making calls to key supporters in Congress. While some have been rushing to get delegates to sign on with the aim of locking Harris in as the nominee within days, a person familiar with the calls told CNN that the vice president herself reiterated to many she spoke with on Sunday that she is opposed to rushing a virtual roll call vote and will follow whatever process the party sets up. For all the endorsements rolling in, she wants to be seen as earning the nomination and not being coronated. One of her\u00a0biggest tasks ahead will likely be very quickly vetting and choosing a running mate. In just the past week of campaign stops, she has appeared with three of the most talked about possibilities: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Harris got to hear Buttigieg from backstage on Saturday in Provincetown as he ripped into Trump running mate JD Vance and then said, \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you how much more well off America is going to be with our vice president compared to the guy that they want to send in to be the vice president.\u201d Others discussed include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. As of Sunday evening, people familiar with several on that list said no vetting requests had come in.\u00a0Shapiro, Beshear and Cooper were among the people who got calls from Harris on Sunday. A historic candidacy as the base has drifted away Harris\u00a0wouldn\u2019t just be the second woman at the top of a national ticket. She\u2019s a half-Jamaican, half-Indian woman whose given names are Kamala and Devi, who identified so strongly with the American Black experience that she specifically chose Howard University for college.\u00a0She\u2019s also married to a Jewish man. Her candidacy is historic. But she has long been hyper-sensitive, as have some key people around her, to even inadvertent slights against her because she is a woman, or because she is a person of color. Even on the international stage, staff had grown weary of still having to gently correct some other governments\u2019 protocol offices after they seated the vice president at dinners next to the wife of a foreign leader rather than the leader himself. People close to Harris are steeling themselves for vicious attacks, and also for the possibility that she is about to\u00a0confront subconscious\u00a0racism and sexism. They are also counting on\u00a0Harris\u2019 candidacy\u00a0to\u00a0drive\u00a0a massive burst of enthusiasm from the base, both because it\u2019s a shift from one of the most intense months of Democratic despair, and because, if she\u2019s the nominee,\u00a0the base will be represented in a way that many core party voters did not feel was the case from an 81-year-old White man whose most consistent Saturday evening activity was going to mass. With women across the country already highly engaged on abortion, several Democrats predicted a boost from elevating\u00a0a woman who has been out front on this issue for years. \u201cShe\u2019s just so much more robust and so much more authentic and so much more credentialed to speak about this,\u201d Timmaraju said. \u201cIt\u2019s the number one persuasion message in this campaign, and now you have the best advocate.\u201d Still, the worries about what Harris has been handed have been spreading for weeks. No one knows how most voters will respond to her, but even in polls that show her doing better than Biden, she is still behind Trump. Among those alarmed at the potential repercussions if she loses: Connecticut Rep. Jahana Hayes, who in a meeting of House Democrats two weeks ago said she worried that Harris and Black women overall could end up bearing the blame for a loss that\u00a0she thinks would be\u00a0more the fault of Biden, Democratic infighting and overall dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. Hayes declined comment to CNN on Sunday night about her feelings\u00a0after Biden dropped out. Laphonza Butler, another longtime friend now serving as senator from California, told CNN she thinks both Harris\u2019 experience as vice president and Trump\u2019s legal problems make for a very different situation from the last campaign, on which she was an adviser. \u201cJust like a prosecutor, she is going to know her case inside and out. She is going to have her facts and her witnesses lined up and she is going to be talking to the jury, the American people,\u201d Butler told CNN. Potential benefits of an abbreviated run After a January 2019 campaign launch that was so big that\u00a0the Oakland\u00a0streets were packed for blocks and helicopters circled overhead trying to estimate how many thousands were there, Harris quickly fizzled out. Splashy successes tended to be followed by weeks of missteps. Imagining a standard two-year primary campaign, former aides and friends alike saw at best a tortured slog. As hard as it will be for her to\u00a0mount a campaign with just over 100 days before the election, several who know her told CNN that it may turn out to be the best news for her. \u201cShe\u2019s at her best when she\u2019s got a high sense of urgency and limited time. She\u2019s at her best when she\u2019s prosecuting the case and has a foe to call out, and she has the ultimate foe,\u201d said a former Harris aide. \u201cShe\u2019s a better sprinter than marathon runner, and I think that\u2019s going to be advantageous.\u201d Warren echoed that. \u201cWhen the pressure is on, she gets calmer and more focused,\u201d Warren said. And the Massachusetts senator said she hoped that she and other progressive leaders\u00a0vouching\u00a0for Harris would head off any cannibalizing from the left. One House Democrat in a seat where Trump won in 2020 urged Harris not to bow to some of the \u201cwoke\u201d thinking that they said has dominated the party in recent years. \u201cShe can\u2019t do this if she runs as a lawyer from California. She\u2019s got to do this as someone who does the right thing, even if it pisses off progressives, someone who takes on crime whether it\u2019s white-collar crime or street crime,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cShe has a profile that hasn\u2019t been exercised properly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-strategy-against-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_trump-team-kamala-harris-attacks", "text": "The Sunday after the June 27 presidential debate, top advisers to Donald Trump went to bed expecting the Democratic handwringing over President Joe Biden\u2019s performance to cool and give way to a fresh cycle of headlines at the start of the new week. But when they awoke the next morning to the Democratic calamity intensifying, they began the early plotting for the extraordinary potential scenario of Biden stepping aside. Behind the scenes, between preparing for a convention and a nation-rattling assassination attempt, they also studied up on the field of potential Democratic contenders, polled Trump\u00a0against a would-be replacement and began soft launching more attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris,\u00a0believing her to be the most likely heir-apparent. Now, with Biden announcing he won\u2019t run for reelection, the seeds of that work are already on display. Within hours of Biden dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president on Sunday, Trump\u2019s campaign managers had released a blistering statement tying Harris to the administration\u2019s policies. Meanwhile, an aligned super PAC has reserved airtime in a handful of swing states to try to define Harris to impressionable voters as someone who enabled a clearly diminished Biden. Trump, too, worked quickly to gain the upper hand over whoever his next opponent may be by suggesting the next debate move from the agreed-upon host network, ABC,\u00a0to the friendlier confines of Fox News. Biden, Trump wrote on social media, \u201cwas not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\u201d The three-week scramble by the Trump campaign to prepare for the unprecedented may have started as a contingency but it now becomes an urgent necessity. For all the times over the past year Trump has claimed he didn\u2019t expect Biden\u2019s candidacy to last until November, neither he nor his campaign took serious steps to prepare for that outcome. Instead, Trump\u2019s team had orchestrated an exacting campaign around defeating Biden. It included millions of dollars already spent on models to predict results in key battlegrounds, putting in place a sophisticated data operation and readying an advertising blitz to contrast the two candidates. It\u2019s a campaign built around the assumption Trump would face an 81-year-old whose physical state and mental acuity had become such an albatross that enough voters would overlook the Republican nominee\u2019s many flaws. Now, much of that work will be unusable or at the very least must be reimagined for a race completely altered by recent events. Whether Democrats anoint Harris or another name, Trump, the oldest major party nominee in history,\u00a0becomes the candidate whose age is a concern for some voters. \u201cThe real value (Harris) brings is simply the fact that Democrats won\u2019t have to worry whether their nominee can meet the minimal threshold of fitness for office,\u201d said one Republican strategist who asked not to be named to speak freely. \u201cThat means this will be a real campaign.\u201d Attack ads at the ready For a time, Republicans gleefully watched the chaos unfolding on the Democratic side, and Trump for a couple weeks laid low while Biden fumbled through the fallout. But it was soon widely acknowledged within Trump\u2019s camp that Biden bowing out would also throw their own campaign into uncertainty. As the calls for Biden to step down hit a fever pitch in early July, the Trump campaign started researching Democratic National Committee rules and bylaws to understand the internal processes that would take place if Biden should step aside, according to a senior official in the Trump campaign. Trump\u2019s campaign also began privately ramping up and testing new lines of attack on Harris \u2014 someone they had largely ignored since she was sworn in as vice president. That included sprinkling new criticisms of the California Democrat into Trump\u2019s speeches and encouraging the former president\u2019s surrogates to do the same, according to two senior Trump advisers. Some of those new attacks revealed themselves at the Republican National Convention last week, where Harris was easily the second-most criticized Democrat on the stage behind Biden. Now that the moment has arrived, Trump\u2019s team is planning a series of negative ads going after Harris\u2019 record, not only under the Biden administration, but also during her time as a prosecutor and attorney general in California, a source familiar told CNN. The messaging will come through both the campaign and at least one\u00a0super PAC aligned with the former president. While polling has shown Harris is the best known among possible Democratic candidates to replace Biden, Trump\u2019s advisers and allies maintain that most Americans don\u2019t know much about her, creating an opening to define her to the public. The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, previewing the plan of attack. The accusing ad said Harris \u201ccovered up Joe Biden\u2019s obvious mental decline.\u201d It proceeds to include clips of Harris praising Biden\u2019s performance as president, saying, \u201cOur president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done.\u201d The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita last week hinted that the campaign intends to make an issue of Harris standing by Biden in the months leading up to the debate, when the president\u2019s\u00a0performance brought to the forefront concerns about his stamina. \u201cYou know how much tape we have on this?\u201d LaCivita said Thursday at an event outside the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Along those lines, Republicans have argued that Biden should step down immediately as president if he has concluded he can\u2019t manage another four-year term. Trump\u2019s campaign and allies also plan to argue that Harris is the person in the administration responsible for the border \u2013 a key theme in GOP messaging this year \u2013 after Biden deputized her in 2021 to tackle the root causes of migration from Central America. They also intend to tie her to the country\u2019s inflation woes and are plotting similar messaging around crime they once prepared for Biden. \u201cOver the last four years she co-signed Biden\u2019s open border and green scam policies that drove up the cost of housing and groceries,\u201d Trump\u2019s new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance,\u00a0said Sunday after Biden endorsed Harris. \u201cShe owns all of these failures.\u201d Unknown, though, is whether voters who for months have told pollsters they dreaded a 2020 rematch will gravitate toward a fresh face. Many voters \u2013 including ones who intended to vote for Trump when he faced Biden \u2013 have deeply held negative opinions of the former president and have expressed a desire to move on from him. Harris also has an opportunity to reenergize Democrats who had grown disenchanted by Biden\u2019s presidency. One veteran Republican strategist said Trump should prepare for Georgia \u2013 which Democrats had begun to believe was out of reach \u2013 to become competitive once again. \u201cBiden was struggling with Black voters and young voters,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cSeems to me that Kamala will likely do better with those groups. The question is how much.\u201d Brian Bartlett, an adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, said Trump could also face new headwinds in swing states depending on who is tapped to join the Democratic ticket as vice president. \u201cThe writing\u2019s been on the wall for a while now, so I expected they\u2019re fairly prepared with messaging, oppo and the like,\u201d\u00a0Bartlett said. \u201cBiggest potential challenge I see is if (Harris) picks a running mate that can bring over some of the blue wall or other key swing states.\u201d Already some of those names have circulated as potential vice presidential picks, including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. The Trump campaign had prepared dossiers on some of those individuals, believing they could also emerge as potential successors, which one of the senior advisers referred to as \u201cbinders full of research.\u201d Other names they\u2019ve studied include Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and congressional leaders. But the majority of their focus in recent weeks has centered on Harris, they said, including conducting internal polling to test her in a match up against Trump, a second senior adviser said. Asked if they had begun to test Trump versus other Democrats in surveys, LaCivita last week responded in exasperation: \u201cWe\u2019re a capable operation. What the hell do you think?\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_joe-biden-drops-out-election", "text": "President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him on Sunday. \u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter\u00a0posted\u00a0to his official account on X. \u201cAnd while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail. In a follow-up post, Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her. \u201cMy very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the best decision I\u2019ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.\u201d Harris, who was informed of Biden\u2019s decision Sunday, said in a statement that she was \u201chonored to have the President\u2019s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\u201d She is spending the day reaching out to lawmakers, outside organizations and donors, and was slated to make up to 200 calls on Sunday alone, a top Democratic source close to her told CNN. Many prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, quickly came out in support of Harris, although some who released statements reacting to Biden\u2019s decision did not mention the vice president, including former President Barack Obama. \u201cI have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\u201d Obama said in a statement that kept the focus on Biden. An adviser said Obama is taking the same approach as he did in the 2020 Democratic primary, watching closely with the intent of being able to help unify the party when a nominee is chosen \u2013 whether it is Harris or someone else. Others explicitly called for an open process to determine who should replace Biden at the top of the ticket. Later Sunday, the Biden-Harris campaign formally amended its filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee \u201cHarris for President.\u201d But Harris\u2019 ascension to the top of the ticket isn\u2019t a certainty. The nominee will now be determined by the delegates to the Democratic National Convention. While Biden won an overwhelming majority of the delegates during the primary process earlier this year, they are now free to choose a candidate of their choice and he cannot simply transfer them to Harris. Biden\u2019s departure capped off weeks of concern about the 81-year-old president\u2019s stamina and mental capabilities and skepticism of his ability to effectively campaign against former President Donald Trump and govern the country for another four years.\u00a0While Biden said he is committed to serving out the remainder of his term, his decision sparked immediate calls from Republicans for him to step down as president. Trump said Biden \u201cis not fit to serve\u201d in a post on Truth Social. In a phone call with CNN after Biden\u2019s announcement, Trump said Biden would go down \u201cas the single worst president by far in the history of our country\u201d and said he thought Harris would be easier to defeat than Biden. Other leading Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, called on Biden to \u201cresign the office immediately.\u201d \u201cIf Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. It\u2019s the first time a one-term US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades and recalls President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s decision not to seek a second full\u00a0term in 1968 \u2013 though Biden\u2019s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson\u2019s.\u00a0It\u2019s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump\u2019s life. But not even the attempted assassination on Trump and its tumultuous effect on the race would pause the drain of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well. Biden\u2019s final decision to leave the race was reached in the last 48 hours, a senior campaign adviser said, as he consulted family and top advisers by telephone. He did not have a final in-person meeting with his top campaign or White House advisers as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. As his decision neared its end, first lady Jill Biden remained her husband\u2019s most ardent supporter. \u201cDown to the last hours of the decision only he could make, she was supportive of whatever road he chose,\u201d Jill Biden\u2019s communications director Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement to CNN. The president\u2019s exit from the race sets the stage for the conclusion to a political career that has spanned a half-century, one that saw Biden enter as one of the youngest senators in US history and exit as its oldest president. Age and questions about the president\u2019s mental faculties had been Biden\u2019s biggest political liability since he first ran against Trump in 2020. Biden\u2019s disastrous performance at a June 27 CNN debate \u2013 during which the president spoke softly, had a glazed-over look and, at one point, appeared to lose his train of thought mid-sentence while his opponent delivered an animated, while mainly fact-free performance \u2013 brought those concerns to the forefront of the political conversation and ultimately doomed his reelection push. Biden\u2019s campaign had asked for\u00a0the\u00a0June debate in the hopes that it would force voters to tune into the race \u2013 and what Biden had said was at stake \u2013 earlier than usual. But that strategy appeared to backfire as the president solidified what had been the most persistent concern about his candidacy. The president\u2019s performance shocked his donors, closest allies and the 50 million Americans who saw Biden stumble throughout the 90-minute debate \u2014 the\u00a0most extensive exposure\u00a0to an unscripted Biden since the last round of general-election debates four years ago. It left the White House and Biden campaign in a frenzied scramble to explain away his condition \u2013 at first, blaming it on a cold, before days later saying the president had been jet lagged by his international travel that wrapped up about 12 days prior to the debate. The president\u2019s surrogates and campaign officials sought to soothe Democratic anxieties, hurriedly calling meetings with donors and top supporters to assure them that Biden\u2019s performance was the product of one bad night and ask them to consider it in the context of his three-and-a-half-year presidency. The president himself recognized how poorly the night had gone almost immediately; at a campaign rally the next day, he sought to promote an animated and energized image that had largely been absent from the debate stage. \u201cI don\u2019t walk as easy as I used to,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.\u201d But the damage had already been done. By the Monday after the debate, murmurs about replacing Biden on the ticket had grown into a full public conversation. The mood in the White House and at Biden\u2019s campaign headquarters in Wilmington had turned sour. Biden, seeking to assert his control over his campaign and the presidency, delivered brief remarks that evening on the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity decision earlier that day, asking voters to \u201cdissent\u201d in a rare political overture from the White House. The next day, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first member of Congress from Biden\u2019s own party to ask him to drop out. The fractures in Biden\u2019s support have grown steadily wider every day since. By the time Biden exited the race, dozens of lawmakers\u00a0had asked him to bow out. So had major donors. Actor George Clooney, who has known Biden for years and was one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest boosters of the president, said in a July 10 New York Times opinion piece that Democrats \u201care not going to win in November with this president\u201d and called for the party to pick a new nominee. Biden was initially defiant that he would remain in the race. But as the defections in his base of support continued, and leading Democrats in Congress continued to have difficult conversations with the president about his odds against Trump and the damaging effect he might have on down-ballot Democrats in competitive races, Biden opened himself up more to the idea of dropping out of the race. In an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on July 5, Biden laughed off questions about his political future and said only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could convince him to drop from the race. Days later, Stephanopoulos candidly told a passerby that he also didn\u2019t think Biden could serve another four years. Biden told reporters at a NATO news conference he would drop out if polls showed he could not win. About a week later, he said he would reevaluate whether to stay in if he had \u201csome medical condition that emerged\u201d and doctors told him that would be an issue. The next day, the White House announced that Biden had Covid-19. The attempt on Trump\u2019s life on July 13 briefly stemmed the flow of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to drop out and pulled the national attention away from his faltering presidential campaign. But the reprieve didn\u2019t last long. California Rep. Adam Schiff on July 17 became the first House Democrat to call on Biden to step down since the assassination attempt, and more followed in the ensuing days. Biden\u2019s evolution on his future as the party\u2019s nominee tracked closely with efforts among his biggest allies to convince him the path to victory was narrow. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden weeks after his debate that polls showed he could not win. A senior Democratic adviser told CNN the president was becoming \u201creceptive\u201d to conversations about him stepping aside: \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win?\u201d Those conversation accelerated as Biden isolated at his beach home with Covid over the last few days. Saturday night, Biden asked two of his closest advisers to start drafting the letter, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many rank-and-file staff found out about Biden\u2019s decision when the post came out. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, Betsy Klein, Ethan Cohen, Abby Phillip and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_kamala-harris-biography", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him in the campaign has upended the presidential\u00a0race\u00a0and shined a renewed spotlight on Harris. Her career path from prosecutor to politician has been defined by many firsts: She was the nation\u2019s first Indian American senator and\u00a0California\u2019s\u00a0first female and\u00a0South Asian attorney general. Harris is the first woman to become vice president, as well as the first Black or Asian American person to hold the office. Now, as momentum builds to position her as the Democratic Party\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee, Harris could be on the cusp of becoming the country\u2019s first female president. Here\u2019s what to know about Harris\u2019 life and the moments that defined her in politics. The daughter of immigrants Kamala Devi Harris was born in Oakland, California, on October 20, 1964. In the introduction to her 2019 memoir, \u201cThe Truths We Hold,\u201d Harris noted that her name is pronounced \u201c\u2018comma-la,\u2019 like the punctuation mark\u201d and that it means \u201clotus flower,\u201d in homage to an important symbol in Indian culture. Harris\u2019 father, Donald, immigrated to the United States from Jamaica to study economics at the University of California at Berkeley. He is now a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, immigrated to the US from southern India in the late 1950s. She earned her doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at Berkley and became an acclaimed breast cancer researcher before she passed away in 2009. Harris writes that her parents \u201cmet and fell in love at Berkeley while participating in the civil rights movement,\u201d but the couple later divorced when Harris and her sister, Maya, were young. Harris credits her\u00a0mother for \u201cshaping us into the women we would become\u201d and for teaching her daughters to be proud of both their\u00a0Indian and Black heritage. \u201cOur classical Indian names harked back to our heritage, and we were raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for Indian culture,\u201d Harris wrote in her memoir. \u201cMy mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.\u201d A career of \u2018firsts\u2019 In 1982, Harris enrolled at Howard University, a historically Black university in the heart of Washington, DC. There, she joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country\u2019s oldest Black sorority, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and economics. She would later become the first HBCU graduate to be elected vice president. After college, Harris returned to California and attended law school at the University of California Hastings. When she decided to pursue a career as a prosecutor in the district attorney\u2019s office, Harris said she knew she would have to defend her choice to her friends and family. \u201cAmerica has a deep and dark history of people using the power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cBut I also knew that what was wrong with the system didn\u2019t need to be an immutable fact. And I wanted to be a part of changing that.\u201d After graduating from law school, Harris spent three decades as a prosecutor, serving as a deputy district attorney for Oakland\u2019s Alameda County before she was elected in 2004 to be district attorney of San Francisco. In 2011, Harris became the first Black American, first woman, and first Asian American elected to be the attorney general of California. During her time as attorney general, Harris met and befriended Biden\u2019s eldest son, Beau, who also served as Delaware\u2019s attorney general. Harris\u2019 record as a prosecutor \u2013 and later California\u2019s top law enforcement official \u2013 came under scrutiny during her 2020 presidential campaign, with progressive activists and law enforcement advocates questioning several decisions she made in office, including her stance against the death penalty. In 2014, Harris married Doug Emhoff, a former managing partner at a law firm. The couple met on a blind date and Harris later joked in her memoir that her staffers referred \u201cto that era as A.D. \u2013 \u2018After Doug.\u2019\u201d Emhoff is the nation\u2019s first second gentleman. From prosecutor to politician In 2015, Harris launched a campaign for the US Senate, vying to replace\u00a0longtime California Sen. Barbara Boxer. Both former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden endorsed her campaign and she would later write in her memoir that election night in 2016 was \u201csurreal\u201d for many reasons \u2013 not only because she won. \u201cI was a US senator-elect \u2013 the first Black woman from my state, and the second in the nation\u2019s history, to earn that job,\u201d she wrote. But, as it became clear that Donald Trump would become the 45th president of the United States, Harris said she abandoned the speech she originally wrote under the assumption that the country would elect its first female president, and instead urged the supporters \u201cto be committed to bringing our country together.\u201d During her time in the US Senate, Harris served on the Senate Judiciary Committee as well as the Select Committee on Intelligence before launching a bid for the White House in 2019. During a crowded presidential primary debate that year, Harris confronted then-Vice President Biden\u2019s record, including his previous stance on desegregation and school busing. Biden later told CNN after the debate, \u201cI was prepared for them to come after me. \u2026 But I wasn\u2019t prepared for the person coming at me the way (Harris) came after me. She knew Beau, she knows me.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision to later select Harris to be his running mate came as a surprise to some, but he would describe it as \u201cthe best decision I\u2019ve made.\u201d On January 20, 2021, Harris was sworn in as the country\u2019s first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president. In her role as president of the Senate, according to the White House, Harris set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-biography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_youth-organization-outreach-harris-campaign", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign team began conducting outreach to several youth grassroots organizations shortly after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race. Voters of Tomorrow, a youth voting grassroots organization, said it spoke with Harris\u2019 campaign after members reached out shortly after Biden\u2019s Sunday announcement. \u201cVice President Harris herself clearly cares about the youth vote,\u201d said Santiago Mayer, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to get on the ground. Start knocking on doors, start having conversations, remind young voters about what the stakes are this election, and\u00a0make sure that come November, we elect Vice President Harris\u00a0to be Madam\u00a0President Harris.\u201d Some of Harris\u2019 campaign staff, including Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director, are expected to attend this week\u2019s Voters of Tomorrow Summit in Atlanta, where hundreds of youth activists, content creators and grassroots organizations are set to discuss the November election. Several youth organizers told CNN that there is renewed energy among Democratic Party members regarding Harris\u2019 nomination.\u00a0CNN\u2019s latest\u00a0polling\u00a0on matchups between Biden or Harris against Trump suggests Harris outperforms Biden among young voters but still doesn\u2019t generate the level of support that Democratic presidential candidates have had in recent elections. \u201cThe prospect of potentially having our first woman president is really exciting to a lot of young people who have grown up never really seeing that idea come true,\u201d Katy Gates, the president of the College Democrats of Georgia, told CNN. Other youth grassroots organizations, such as Gen Z for Change, formerly known as TikTok for Biden \u2013 which has been openly critical of Biden in the last few months and now has endorsed Harris \u2013 told CNN that the campaign has reached out to them as well. \u201cIn the last couple months it really felt like Biden had become unmovable on the issues that were most important to young people, like policies on Gaza, climate, immigration, for example, it really didn\u2019t seem like they were budging at all,\u201d said Claire Simon, the group\u2019s communications director. \u201cBut I think we see the Harris campaign as a big opportunity for her to adopt a lot of the policies that we know will really drive young people to the polls.\u201d Simon told CNN that she hopes to talk with the campaign and push Harris to support some of the progressive policies her group is advocating for. Since Biden\u2019s announcement, Democratic youth organizations and progressive activists have capitalized on social media memes of Harris in an effort to showcase the vice president in a more relatable light. Sohali Vaddula, national director of communications for the College Democrats of America, the DNC\u2019s youth arm, told CNN the organization has \u201cbeen really proactive about keeping up our digital engagement.\u201d Vaddula plans on working closely with the Harris campaign team to make sure they are using her on social media. \u201cWe do a lot of outreach with our socials, but recently, we\u2019re planning to do a rebrand and get even more people on there, especially people that are already influencers in the political world that have a great following on, like, TikTok and other platforms,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s team has long relied on influencers to help the 81-year-old president garner more support among young voters. Harris, 59, has a long-standing relationship with social media influencers as well. In the 2022 midterm election cycle, the vice president sat down with several social media influencers to discuss what was at stake. Harris was also considered to be the Democratic National Committee\u2019s top surrogate for influencer collaborations after participating in over a dozen recorded one-on-one conversations with creators about the importance of voting in the midterm elections, according to a DNC aide. As the Harris campaign prepares for next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention, they will also be taking advantage of working with\u00a0content creators who are going to be given access to the event. The Harris campaign has not responded to CNN\u2019s inquiries on this matter at this time.

{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_the-politics-of-jd-vance-as-told-in-hillbilly-elegy", "text": "It\u2019s a story \u2014 young memoirist with an Ivy League law degree tells a compelling story, catapults into the Senate and joins the national political conversation \u2014 familiar to anyone who followed the career of Barack Obama. But instead of Obama, the memoirist of the moment is JD Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, who has been tapped by former President Donald Trump as his vice presidential running mate and, at 39, the next generation of the MAGA movement. Vance\u2019s book, like Obama\u2019s, is about a young man largely raised by his grandparents and overcoming themes of alienation. Vance\u2019s\u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d was also turned into a Ron Howard movie. \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d caused a sensation after Trump\u2019s election in 2016 as people tried to understand how Democrat Hillary Clinton had lost the Rust Belt states. The book, with touching stories about Vance\u2019s upbringing, his drug-addicted mother and his foul-mouthed, gun-toting grandmother, attempts to explain the disaffection of the white, working-class Americans who felt like American society was passing them by as they witnessed the decay of once-thriving towns. Vance has clearly evolved since the book\u2019s publication. He opposed Trump when it was first published just before the 2016 election and is now on the same presidential ticket, a full-fledged Trump acolyte. Trump\u2019s and Vance\u2019s stories are about as opposite as it is possible for the stories of two white men to be. Trump built his business career with loans from his father. Vance dropped his biological father\u2019s name, Donald, to simply become JD. Trump was born into wealth in a city where he lived most of his life. Vance counts his home as Kentucky, where his grandparents were from and where he visited as a child. Trump avoided service in Vietnam. Vance enlisted in the Marines and deployed to Iraq. Where Trump has an \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d view of the world, Vance takes a far more humble approach to his own abilities and credits others with helping him succeed despite despair in his home town. Here are some quotes from the book that struck me on a rereading: Vance\u2019s grandparents didn\u2019t graduate from high school and they moved, he says, from Kentucky to Ohio when his grandmother was pregnant at the age of 14, in search of work and a better life. His grandfather made a life as a steelworker and, despite his mother\u2019s descent into addiction, his grandparents were among \u201ca handful of loving people (who) rescued me.\u201d He feels kinship with people whose families, like his, have roots in Appalachia and have not kept pace with social mobility in the US. There are multiple passages about how views in these communities about how a man should act are hurting men, who, he says, drop out of the labor force and refuse to relocated for opportunity. While Vance acknowledges that his Mamaw only survived in her later years with government help, there is a marked disdain for programs that help people who are not old. Vance says: Much of the book is built around Vance\u2019s relationship with his grandmother, Mamaw, \u201cthe toughest woman anyone knew,\u201d who died in 2005 and who he lovingly mentioned in his speech Wednesday at the Republican National Convention. The book is filled with foul-mouthed quotes and gun-toting anecdotes about her and other members of his Kentucky forebears. At a time when immigration plays such an important role in national politics, it\u2019s interesting that migration within the US is a key component of Vance\u2019s book. His family and millions of others like them had to move to make their way in the world. His grandparents were Democrats because of social class. He argues that the American Dream felt attainable to his grandparents\u2019 generation. The book is specifically about white, working-class Americans. But at several points Vance compares the plight of white Americans in Appalachia and in the Rust Belt to that of Black Americans left behind in American cities. Vance takes a dim view of people who complain about lack of work in their towns. He says many of them are lazy. Now a practicing Catholic, he is frustrated that more people in the Rust Belt do not attend church and he repeatedly argues that churches can provide support to people who are in need. In one key section describing a job during his teenage years at a grocery store in roughly the early 2000s, Vance expresses anger at people getting help from the government, but able to have phones, which were not as ubiquitous back then. It was seeing people \u201clive off the dole,\u201d that began to turn Vance against Democrats, although I have to say that reading this passage today I\u2019m not sure how many people getting food assistance are buying T-bone steaks. A general move away from Democrats in the Rust Belt could be explained through a racial lens, by the Democrats\u2019 embrace of the Civil Rights movement, or for social reasons, as evangelical Christians gravitated to the right. But Vance says an aggrieved perception of welfare programs is largely to blame. He also tells the story of his grandmother\u2019s frustration when a neighbor rents out his house as a Section 8 property. Conversely, Mamaw would also bristle that ballots to raise taxes for local schools would fail. Eventually, Middletown, Ohio, began to founder much as the Kentucky of Mamaw\u2019s youth. Vance sees a general societal decline in these areas and it\u2019s about more than a lack of jobs. Vance prizes hard work and thoughtful financial decisions. He joins the Marines specifically in order to afford college, so it should be no surprise that today he is a vehement critic of student loan forgiveness. There is also a passage where, as an Ohio State student, he describes making use of a payday loan. He argued that while these loans might have exorbitant interest rates and appear rapacious to consumer advocates, the loan was there when he needed it. So he opposed a bill then under consideration in Ohio to regulate payday loans. As Vance headed off to Yale Law School, his future bright after years of work, he began to feel out of place in Middletown, where despair was growing. There are the beginnings of a desire for a populist hero. Vance does not see racism in the rejection by many White Rust Belt viewers of Obama, but rather anti-elitism. He also sees a failing on the right to promote accountability and inspire people to succeed. Vance feels out of place in Middletown, but also at Yale. He also becomes more health-conscious during the course of the book. At one point, Vance meets a politician from Indiana. One can imagine Daniels, a former Indiana governor and George W. Bush official who is opposed by the MAGA wing of the GOP, is no longer Vance\u2019s hero. The short final chapter that suggests social policy needs to do more to understand the white working class, but it\u2019s not particularly detailed. Vance points out that his rise was built on government help, including student loans, the old age benefits his grandmother shared with him and the public schools of his youth and college years. He argues that the country should do more to integrate low-income people into the middle class. The closest he comes to a policy proposal is frustration at how the federal government applies Section 8 housing assistance. Later, he admits that answers are hard to come by.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/the-politics-of-jd-vance-as-told-in-hillbilly-elegy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_democratic-donors-harris-biden", "text": "Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia lawyer and longtime Democratic fundraiser, said the texts and emails began soon after news broke Sunday that President Joe Biden had withdrawn from the 2024 race and called for Vice President Kamala Harris to become his successor. One, in particular, summed up the mood among Biden\u2019s donors, he said. \u201cThis is transformative,\u201d the text from a major contributor read. After weeks of turmoil over the future of the Democratic ticket, Kessler said the campaign donors he\u2019s courted as a bundler for Biden\u2019s campaign are turning their full attention to Harris and committing to work on her behalf. \u201cThey\u2019re really excited, and they are all in,\u201d he said. Matt Gorman, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, told CNN, \u201cMy phone\u2019s been ringing off the hook.\u201d Gorman said that while he deeply respects Biden, he feels it\u2019s \u201cincumbent\u201d upon him to support the decision that\u2019s been made and \u201cback up Harris.\u201d He and fellow donors are \u201cexcited\u201d about Harris, and he said that he\u2019s received many calls from people who had been holding back their money, now asking where to throw their money behind, whether it\u2019s the Democratic National Committee or specific PACs. \u201cThe energy in the last 6 hours has been reinvigorating and inspiring,\u201d Gorman said. In another sign of enthusiasm: Harris raised $49.6 million in grassroots donations for her campaign since Biden endorsed her Sunday, campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said. Harris will need the money. Although the Biden-Harris campaign and its affiliated committees outraised former President Donald Trump\u2019s political operation in June, newly filed campaign reports show the Trump team entered July and the general election showdown with a bigger war chest of available cash. The Biden campaign had dramatically outspent the Trump last month, drawing down the campaign\u2019s reserves \u2013 just as concerns grew about Biden\u2019s poor June 27 debate performance, putting future contributions at risk. On Sunday afternoon, the Biden campaign filed paperwork with federal election regulators, transforming itself into the \u201cHarris for President\u201d committee. But Harris is not yet the Democrats\u2019 presidential nominee. It\u2019s now up to some 4,700 delegates to decide who officially becomes the party\u2019s standard-bearer. Biden\u2019s withdrawal caps weeks of uncertainty and drama. Some Democratic donors were so alarmed by Biden\u2019s halting appearance on the debate stage that they declared an embargo on future giving to his campaign \u2013 and in some cases vowed to withhold contributions to down-ballot Democratic candidates \u2013 until the president agreed to withdraw from the race. On Sunday, after Biden\u2019s announcement, Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond unleashed anger at some of those big donors, saying they had \u201ccreated a self-fulfilling prophecy\u201d by declining to give money to support Biden after his debate performance. \u201cYou can\u2019t win without money, and then they were going to point the finger at the candidate. They were going to blame it on Biden,\u201d Richmond said. \u201cFor a president that has accomplished so much, it was a no-win situation.\u201d Richmond also had this message to financial backers who had abandoned the president in recent weeks: \u201cNow those donors need to step the f**k up.\u201d One former elected Democratic official who is still very active in the party said people who had cancelled their fundraising events for July and August after the debate are now putting them back on the calendar. \u201cEverything is back on,\u201d the source said. And while donations may be going up for Harris specifically, as one donor put it, the main goal is beating Trump. \u201cEvery election is about something different. This one\u2019s so much about anti-Donald Trump,\u201d the donor said. \u2018DEMBARGO is lifted\u2019 \u201cSuffice to say, the DEMBARGO is lifted,\u201d Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer, wrote Sunday on Instagram. Lindelof was among the contributors who had called\u00a0on fellow Democratic donors\u00a0to stop writing campaign checks. He wrote that he felt \u201cprofound relief, gratitude \u2026 and then for the first time, genuine EXCITEMENT for the election ahead.\u201d Echoing that sentiment, another big-ticket donor said there\u2019s going to be \u201ca massive surge of new energy\u201d around Harris, saying this election is about beating Trump \u2013 and that he\u2019s relieved the focus will go back to that. Another major donor told CNN that they\u2019re \u201cgoing to go in big.\u201d Dick Gephardt, a former Democratic majority leader in the House, said he knows of several people who were holding back money and are now fulfilling their pledges to the party in the wake of the news Sunday. He said he wasn\u2019t planning to hold back his own monetary support, but that he plans to give even more in light of the switch-up. The enthusiasm for Harris among the Democratic donor class was not universal, however. Florida lawyer John Morgan \u2013 an ardent Biden supporter and fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection campaign \u2013 said he no longer plans to raise money for the White House effort because he\u2019s not persuaded that Harris is the strongest candidate Democrats could field. But Biden\u2019s endorsement essentially closes the door on a more open selection process that some in the party had sought, he said. The party would have been better served by \u201csomeone who will appear more moderate\u201d to voters, Morgan said, ticking off Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania as among preferred options. And he said he expects Republicans to quickly cast Harris as a \u201cCalifornia progressive\u201d who bungled efforts to stop illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico, although he views that characterization as unfair. Morgan had planned a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in Florida, but those plans had been put on hold because of the tumult unleashed by the June 27 debate . Morgan said he already had collected $1 million for the event \u2013 money that now likely will benefit Harris \u2013 but will do no more. \u201cWill I vote for Harris? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWill I raise money? No.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left. An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris\u2019 aide cited a previously scheduled event\u00a0as the reason\u00a0for missing the speech Wednesday. A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden\u2019s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister. The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris\u2019 first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris\u2019 candidacy. Harris is expected to \u201ccontinue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,\u201d the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. \u201cWe anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,\u201d according to the aide. \u201cAnd they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.\u201d On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority\u2019s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters. \u201cHer travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,\u201d the aide said. Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu\u2019s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson. Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu\u2019s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN. Netanyahu\u00a0landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a\u00a0post by an Israeli Embassy official on X. He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza \u2013 including Americans \u2013\u00a0on Monday evening. Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_biden-harris-questions-democratic-nominee-who-is-president", "text": "President Joe Biden on Sunday announced he will not seek to be reelected as president in 2024, and he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee. But the 81-year-old\u2019s decision \u2014 with just over 100 days until the election \u2014 has given rise to many more questions about what comes next for the rest of his presidency and for the presidential race. Is Biden still the president? Yes. Biden\u2019s announcement exclusively pertained to his role as the Democratic candidate in November\u2019s presidential election. It has no bearing on his current role or term as president, which he said he intends to serve out in its entirety. Biden will remain president until his successor is sworn in on January 20, 2025. In announcing his decision, Biden wrote, \u201cWhile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d Despite Biden\u2019s statement, some Republicans are urging him to resign effective immediately. Notable lawmakers questioning Biden\u2019s ability to serve as president and calling for his resignation include House Speaker Mike Johnson, House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and the chair of the Senate GOP campaign arm, Montana Sen. Steve Daines. But, again, there is no indication as of Sunday evening that Biden has any intention of stepping down early. Biden endorsed Harris. Does that make her the Democratic nominee? No. Following his announcement, Biden endorsed Harris, his vice president, to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris said in a statement that she was \u201chonored\u201d to receive Biden\u2019s endorsement and intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d the nomination for president in her first public statement since Biden\u2019s stunning announcement. A number of prominent Democrats quickly threw their support behind Harris, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who ran for president in 2020; top House progressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden campaign co-chair. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also endorsed Harris, as did the entire Tennessee delegation to the DNC. But none of this automatically makes her the nominee. How will the Democratic nominee be chosen and who will it be?\u00a0 CNN\u2019s Zachary Wolf and Ethan Cohen have laid out how the complex process to replace Biden will likely play out now that Biden is no longer the Democrat\u2019s presumptive nominee. Individual delegates will now select the party\u2019s nominee during the Democratic convention in Chicago next month \u2014 or, potentially, during a virtual roll call. But because Biden won nearly all of the delegates during the primary process; they were approved by the Biden campaign and pledged to vote for the president. This means that while the delegates can vote however they like, it will largely be Biden backers who will be picking the nominee. That doesn\u2019t mean that a candidate who isn\u2019t endorsed by Biden couldn\u2019t attempt to secure the nomination. Some Democrats are calling for an \u201copen process\u201d to replace Biden, which would see other candidates in addition to Harris join the race. Under party rules, candidates must meet certain requirements to be nominated, including gathering hundreds of signatures from delegates from several states; being a \u201cbona fide Democrat\u201d; and having \u201cestablished substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate.\u201d While this determination is to be made by the DNC national chairperson, the party has not yet released more details on how exactly the process would work. Who else could be the new nominee if not Harris?\u00a0 While Harris received Biden\u2019s endorsement, the names of many prominent Democratic lawmakers have been unofficially floated as alternatives who could go against her for the party\u2019s nomination. Most of those individuals, however, have not announced or otherwise signaled that they intend to vie for the role. On Sunday night, however, sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, independent of West Virginia, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Manchin is considering re-registering as a Democrat and throwing his hat into the ring. Manchin had called for Biden to bow out of the race Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d How will the new presidential nominee\u2019s running mate be chosen? The Democratic Party elects a vice presidential candidate in largely the same manner as the vote for president, although there\u2019s typically not a full vote. In practice, whoever the presidential nominee chooses as their running mate is typically accepted by the delegates. What happens to the money raised for Biden\u2019s reelection? Biden\u2019s reelection efforts had raised a total of $240 million at the end of June. Those funds are split across the DNC, allied committees and Biden\u2019s campaign committee itself. The latter alone holds $95.9 million as of the end of last month, Federal Election Commission data shows. Many campaign finance experts say that, should Harris become the nominee, any money remaining in the campaign\u2019s bank accounts would transfer to her political operation because she already is part of the ticket. But some Republican lawyers disagree, arguing that under some interpretations, Biden and Harris must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted. \u201cIf President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he\u2019ll first have to become his party\u2019s legal nominee,\u201d veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies wrote in an op-ed\u00a0in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. If Harris does not become the nominee, the Biden-Harris campaign could transfer the entire pot to the Democratic National Committee, according to the FEC. The committee would then be empowered to financially support another prominent Democratic nominee, and distribute the cash to candidates further down the ticket along with their allied committees. The DNC would encounter FEC limitations on spending and contributions, should it choose this route. Another option the campaign has is to transform into a political action committee, spending Biden\u2019s funds on independent expenditures such as advertising campaigns for a new presidential candidate. But it would not be allowed to coordinate those spending activities with any of the candidates it supports. Has this ever happened before? While no US president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign due to concerns over his mental fitness, it is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign \u2014 but it is rare. This is the first time a one-term US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades. It recalls former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman\u2019s decisions not to seek full second terms in 1968 and 1952, respectively. Biden\u2019s decision notably comes months closer to Election Day, and it is the latest such decision in history. At least five other former presidents have also rejected the possibility of a second full term. CNN\u2019s David Wright, Zachary B. Wolf, Ethan Cohen, Fredreka Schouten and Alex Leeds Matthews contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-harris-questions-democratic-nominee-who-is-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_fact-checking-night-4-republican-national-convention-trump", "text": "Former President Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday with the most dishonest speech of the four-day Republican National Convention, making more than 20 false claims by CNN\u2019s count. Many of the false claims were ones Trump has made before, some of them for years. They spanned a wide variety of topics, including the economy, immigration, crime, foreign policy and elections. Some of them were wild lies, others smaller exaggerations. Some were in his prepared text (like the absurd claim that he left the Biden administration a world at peace), while he ad-libbed others (such as his usual lies that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election and that the US is experiencing the worst inflation it has ever had). Below is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s false or misleading remarks, plus a fact check of claims made by other Thursday convention speakers. Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden. Former President Donald Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. The current inflation rate, 3% in June 2024, is nowhere near the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920.  Trump could fairly say that the\u00a0inflation rate\u00a0hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but it has since plummeted. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s misleading claim about North Korean missile launches during his presidency Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that he \u201cgot along with\u201d North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and \u201cwe stopped the missile launches from North Korea.\u201d \u201cBut, no, I got along with him,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now North Korea is acting up again.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that he \u201cstopped the missile launches\u201d from North Korea is misleading. While missile launches did pause from North Korea for a period of time during his administration, they started up again before he left office.\u00a0 A May 2019 launch of what was assessed to be a short-range ballistic missile was North Korea\u2019s first since 2017, which was seen as a sign of growing frustration from Kim on the state of talks with the US. North Korea later launched two more missiles in July 2019, a month after Trump\u2019s high-profile meeting with Kim in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. North Korea conducted four missile tests in 2020. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on his claims of defeating ISIS in \u201ccouple of months\u201d Former President Donald Trump claimed in his RNC speech that \u201cwe defeated 100% of ISIS in Syria and Iraq,\u00a0something that was going to take five years. \u2026 We did it in a matter of a couple of months.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim of having defeated ISIS in \u201ca couple of months\u201d isn\u2019t true; the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq in late December 2018, as he has suggested in past remarks, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has before, when he said he defeated the terror group with no caveats or credit to anyone else. Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016. IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. \u201cThe Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group\u2019s governance project,\u201d an analyst there said in a statement at the time. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Donald Trump\u2019s misleading claim that federal judge ruled case against him was \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 Donald Trump said Thursday that the Florida federal judge who was overseeing the classified documents case dismissed the criminal charges against the former president, finding \u201cthat the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional.\u201d Facts first:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is misleading. District Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting the case, violated the Constitution. But Cannon specifically did not comment on the validity of the charges Trump was facing, or whether Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper. In a 93-page ruling\u00a0Monday, Cannon said\u00a0Smith\u2019s appointment\u00a0violated the Constitution. Cannon said that Smith\u2019s position as special counsel \u201ceffectively usurps\u201d Congress\u2019 \u201cimportant legislative authority,\u201d because Congress should have the authority \u2013 not the head of the Justice Department \u2013 to appoint such an official. Cannon also said that Smith\u2019s\u00a0office was being funded improperly. But Cannon also specifically noted that she was not deciding any \u201cother legal rights or claims\u201d brought by Trump or his co-defendants in the case. The judge also said that the Justice Department could potentially revive the case by funding the special counsel through different means. Prosecutors from outside the special counsel\u2019s office could also refile the charges. From CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz Trump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security During his Republican National Convention speech, former President Donald Trump again said that Democrats are harming Social Security and Medicare by letting migrants into the US. \u201cDemocrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people by the millions are coming in \u2013 they\u2019re going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things, and you\u2019re not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true, particularly in the near term, multiple experts say. Many undocumented immigrants work, which means they pay much-needed payroll taxes, and this bolsters the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and extends their solvency. Immigrants who are working legally typically won\u2019t collect benefits for many years. As for those who are undocumented, some are working under fake Social Security numbers, so they are paying payroll taxes but don\u2019t qualify to collect benefits. The Social Security Administration looked at the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security trust funds. It found that in 2010, earnings by unauthorized workers contributed roughly $12 billion on net to the entitlement program\u2019s cash flow. The agency has not updated the analysis since, but this year\u2019s Social Security trustees report noted that increasing average annual total net immigration by\u00a0100,000 persons\u00a0improves the entitlement program\u2019s solvency. \u201cWe estimate that future years will experience a continuation of this positive impact on the trust funds,\u201d said the\u00a0report on unauthorized immigration. Meanwhile, unauthorized immigrants contributed more than\u00a0$35 billion\u00a0on net to Medicare\u2019s trust fund between 2000 and 2011, extending the life of the trust fund by a year, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. \u201cImmigrants tend to be younger and employed, which increases the number of workers paying into the system,\u201d said Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor. \u201cAlso, they have more children, which helps boost the future workforce that will pay payroll taxes.\u201d \u201cImmigrants are good for Social Security,\u201d he said. However, undocumented immigrants who gain legal status that includes eligibility for future Social Security and Medicare benefits could ultimately be a drain to the system, according to Jason Richwine, a resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. \u201cIllegal immigration unambiguously benefits the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, but amnesty (legalization) would reverse those gains and add extra costs,\u201d\u00a0Richwine wrote\u00a0in a report last year. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump on trade deal with China Former President Donald Trump claimed that he struck a trade deal with China, requiring the country to purchase $50 billion worth of American products. \u201cThey buy $50 billion worth,\u201d he said at the Republican National Convention Thursday. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that China bought $50 billion worth of American product as a result of a trade deal is false. Trump is referring to what is known as the\u00a0Phase One deal\u00a0he struck with Beijing in December 2019. While the deal required China to buy\u00a0$50 billion worth of American agricultural products\u00a0by the end of 2021 \u2013 Beijing\u00a0did not live up to its commitment. US agricultural exports to China recovered from the trade war but did not reach the levels in the Phase One commitments, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco Donald Trump exaggerates how much higher gas prices are right now Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump described gas prices\u00a0inaccurately during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention. He said that \u201cgas prices are up 60%.\u201d Facts First: The average price of a regular gallon of gasoline nationwide is $3.51 as of Thursday, according to AAA. That\u2019s up about 47% from the day President Joe Biden was inaugurated, when the average was $2.39, not 60% higher as Trump claimed. Although the United States has a strategic gasoline reserve, which can be tapped by the White House to ease upward pressure on prices,\u00a0as Biden did in May, gas prices are still mostly determined by\u00a0market forces, such as global petroleum production and consumer demand, not solely by the decisions of a sitting US president. From CNN\u2019s Bryan Mena Trump claims government hired 88,000 IRS agents Former President Donald Trump, while recounting a conversation he had with a waitress worried about the taxes on her tips, claimed that the government recently hired 88,000 IRS agents to audit individuals. Facts First:\u00a0This claim is false.\u00a0 The Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 which Congress passed in 2022 without any Republican votes \u2013 provided an about $80 billion, 10-year investment to the IRS. The agency plans to hire tens of thousands of\u00a0IRS\u00a0employees with that money \u2013 but only some will be IRS agents who conduct audits and investigations. Many people will be hired for non-agent roles, such as customer service representatives. And a significant number of the hires are expected to fill the vacant posts left by retirements and other attrition, not take newly created positions. The 88,000 figure comes from a\u00a02021 Treasury Department report\u00a0that estimated the IRS could hire 86,852 full-time employees \u2013 not solely enforcement agents \u2013 over the course of a decade with a nearly $80 billion investment. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco Trump on Biden increasing Americans\u2019 taxes by four times Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim that President Joe Biden wants to hike people\u2019s taxes by four times. \u201cThis is the only administration that said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna raise your taxes by four times what you\u2019re paying now,\u2019\u201d Trump said Thursday in his speech at the Republican National Convention. Facts First:\u00a0This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024.\u00a0 Biden has not proposed quadrupling Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN in May that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s claim on the situation before the \u2018Right to Try\u2019 law Former President Donald Trump touted the \u201cRight to Try\u201d law he signed in 2018 in his convention speech Thursday, which gave terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven\u2019t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Before the measure was passed, Trump claimed,\u00a0terminally ill patients in the United States would have to go to foreign countries to seek experimental treatments or go home to die if they couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cSounds simple, but it\u2019s not, and I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will \u2013 \u00a0instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place \u2013 or if you have no money, going home and dying,\u201d he said. Facts First: This is misleading. It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications \u2013 but the government almost always said yes. Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump\u2019s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own \u201cexpanded access\u201d program. \u2018\u201cEmergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,\u201d Gottlieb testified. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Trump\u2019s claim about Russian warships near Cuba Former President Donald claimed in his RNC speech on Wednesday evening that \u201cRussian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off our coasts in Cuba. \u2026 The press refuses to write about it.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s present-tense claim that Russian warships and nuclear submarines \u201care\u201d operating close to the United States is misleading. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left. A group of four Russian Navy vessels\u00a0arrived in Cuba\u00a0on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The vessels left Havana on June 17. It is also not true that media organizations \u201cdon\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0CNN,\u00a0along\u00a0with\u00a0most\u00a0other\u00a0major news\u00a0outlets, reported on the Russian ships\u2019 positioning. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on military equipment left in Afghanistan Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim, which he has made in\u00a0speech\u00a0after\u00a0speech,\u00a0that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. Trump said, \u201cAnd we also left $85 billion dollars\u2019 worth of military equipment.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has\u00a0estimated\u00a0that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously\u00a0explained, the \u201c$85 billion\u201d is a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s false claim that the \u2018world was at peace\u2019 during his administration Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday, as many others at the RNC did, that while he was president the world was at peace. \u201cOur opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war,\u201d he also claimed later in his speech. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim about world peace under his presidency is false. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021. \u00a0\u00a0 US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa\u2019s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico\u2019s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump on Venezuela\u2019s crime rate Former President Donald Trump said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that \u201cin Venezuela, crime is down 72%\u201d because foreign governments are sending their countries\u2019 criminals to the US. Facts First:\u00a0Trump greatly overstated the Biden-era decline in crime in Venezuela, at least according to the limited statistics that are publicly available.\u00a0 And while it is certain that at least some criminals have joined law-abiding Venezuelans in a mass exodus from the country amid the economic crisis of the last decade, there is no proof Venezuela\u2019s government has deliberately emptied prisons for migration purposes or intentionally sent ex-prisoners to the United States. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s evidence-free claim on immigration Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that immigrants are \u201ccoming from prisons, they\u2019re coming from jails, they\u2019re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. \u2026 Terrorists are coming in at numbers we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that jails around the world are being emptied out so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants, nor for his claim that foreign governments are also emptying out mental health facilities for this purpose. Last year, Trump\u2019s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump\u2019s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN\u2019s own search did not produce any evidence. The website\u00a0FactCheck.org\u00a0also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that\u2019s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN\u2019s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump\u2019s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes \u2013 a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela\u2019s actions has never been corroborated. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s false claim on US crime statistics Former President Donald Trump claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that \u201cour crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim about a dramatic increase in the crime rate is false. Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime\u00a0dropped significantly in the US in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump\u2019s last calendar year in office. Preliminary FBI data for 2023\u00a0showed\u00a0a roughly\u00a013% national decline in murder\u00a0and a roughly 6% national decline in overall reported violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 \u2013 a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall reported violent crime. There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement \u2013 the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data\u00a0usually has some initial errors\u00a0\u2013 so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources\u00a0make it clear crime has indeed\u00a0declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline \u201cever recorded.\u201d And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also \u201ccrime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump blames Biden administration for \u2018greatest invasion in history\u2019 During his RNC speech, former President Donald Trump claimed that the Biden administration has done nothing to curb illegal immigration to the US. \u201cThe greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country\u2014they are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re coming at levels we\u2019ve never seen before it is an invasion indeed and this administration does nothing to stop them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that the Biden administration is doing \u201cnothing\u201d is incorrect.\u00a0Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration.\u00a0\u00a0Arrests along the US southern border dropped 29% in June, according to\u00a0new data\u00a0released by US Customs and Border Protection, following the Biden administration\u2019s order\u00a0severely limiting asylum-seeker crossings.\u201cRecent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,\u201d CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller previously said in a statement. Last month, the Biden administration\u00a0invoked an authority to shut off access\u00a0to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally,\u00a0a significant attempt\u00a0to address one of the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities. It was the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border, using the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand Trump makes claims about grocery prices rising under Biden Former President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that groceries are up 57% during the Biden administration. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims of grocery prices being up 57% are false and could use some context. Inflation\u2019s\u00a0rapid ascent,\u00a0which began in early 2021, was the result of a\u00a0confluence of factors, including effects from the Covid-19 pandemic such as\u00a0snarled supply chains\u00a0and\u00a0geopolitical fallout\u00a0(specifically Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine) that triggered food and energy price shocks.\u00a0Heightened consumer demand\u00a0boosted in part by fiscal stimulus from both the\u00a0Trump\u00a0and\u00a0Biden\u00a0administrations also led to higher prices, as did the post-pandemic imbalance in the labor market. Inflation peaked at 9.1%\u00a0in June 2022, hitting a 41-year high, and has slowed since (the Consumer Price Index\u00a0was at 3% as of June 2024). However, it remains elevated from historical levels. Three-plus years of pervasive and prolonged inflation has\u00a0weighed considerably on Americans, especially lower-income households trying to afford the necessities (food, shelter and transportation). Food prices, specifically grocery prices, did outpace overall inflation\u00a0for much of 2022 and 2023, driven higher by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Still, grocery prices didn\u2019t rise to the extent that Trump claims. Annual food and grocery inflation peaked at 11.4% and 13.5% in August 2022, respectively. Since Biden took office, the CPI \u201cfood at home\u201d index is up 21%, which is higher than its 9% typical rise in recent history over a 54-month period, but it\u2019s not 57%. Through the 12 months that ended in June, overall food and grocery prices\u00a0were up just\u00a02.2%\u00a0and\u00a01.1%, respectively. Certain food categories saw much greater inflation: Notably,\u00a0egg prices were up 70% annually\u00a0in January 2023. However, the\u00a0underlying cause of that sharp increase\u00a0was a highly contagious, deadly avian flu. Food prices are highly volatile and can be influenced by a variety of factors, especially disease,\u00a0extreme weather events, global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and once-in-a-lifetime pandemics. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Trump\u2019s misleading claim about energy independence Former President Donald Trump claimed that the US was \u201cenergy independent\u201d during his presidency but that this changed under President Joe Biden. Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading. \u201cEnergy independent\u201d is a political phrase, not a literal phrase, that can be defined in various ways \u2013 and, under Biden, the US has continued to satisfy the same definitions it satisfied under Trump. US production of oil and gas have set records under Biden. \u201cEnergy independent\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the US uses no foreign energy or that it is untethered from global energy markets; this wasn\u2019t the case under Trump and still isn\u2019t under Biden. Experts in energy policy tend to scoff at the term \u201cenergy independence,\u201d with three experts\u00a0telling CNN in 2022\u00a0that it is a \u201chorrible term,\u201d \u201cridiculous term\u201d and \u201cstupid term,\u201d respectively. But if the term is defined as the US exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, that has\u00a0happened in every year under Biden\u00a0after happening under Trump in 2020 for\u00a0the first time in decades. (In fact, the US surplus in petroleum trade has\u00a0grown under Biden\u00a0as US crude oil\u00a0production and\u00a0exports have hit new highs) And if the term is defined as the US producing more energy than it consumes, that has also\u00a0continued to happen under Biden\u00a0after\u00a0happening under Trump in 2019for the first time in decades. You can read\u00a0here about the various economic reasons the US has imported foreign energy under both Trump and Biden despite its so-called \u201cenergy independence.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Trump\u2019s false claim on his tax cuts Former President Donald Trump once again claimed\u00a0that he signed the largest tax cuts in history during his administration. \u201cWe got credit for the war, and defeating ISIS, and so many things. The great economy, the biggest tax cuts ever, the biggest regulation cuts ever, the creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much,\u201d Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. Facts First:\u00a0This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released in June, the\u00a0federal government\u2019s nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger \u2013 former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy \u2013 over five years. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and Obama\u2019s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the\u00a0eighth largest\u00a0since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby\u00a0 Trump\u2019s false claim US had \u2018no\u2019 inflation during his presidency Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that inflation did not exist during his presidency \u2013 drawing a contrast between his administration and that of President Joe Biden, whose early years in office were plagued by decades-high inflation. \u201cWe had no inflation,\u201d Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s comment is false. Inflation was low, but not nothing. The Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump\u2019s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump repeats frequent claim about oil drilling and gas prices As he has done repeatedly on the campaign trail, Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that under a new Trump administration, the United States would \u201cdrill, baby, drill, \u2026 by doing that, we will lead to a large-scale decline in prices.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s frequent campaign claim that the US can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil is misleading. Under President Joe Biden, US oil production has reached a new record this year, even surpassing output under Trump\u2019s administration. The Energy Information Administration expects crude oil production to hit successive records this year and next, powered by an oil boom in the Permian Basin. As CNN has reported, the US currently produces more oil than any other country on the planet, at about half a million barrels per day more than the prior annual record set in 2019. Prices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and the US cannot be truly energy independent when it comes to gas prices, energy experts have told CNN. Oil is a global commodity; the global price of oil determines US gas prices and it\u2019s simply impossible to separate that price from shifting global dynamics like Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine or OPEC\u2019s recent decisions to cut oil production. \u201cWhether we\u2019re drill baby, drilling has more to do with what the price of crude oil is, how healthy is the economy,\u201d Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN recently. \u201cThese things are outside of a president\u2019s direct control.\u201d There\u2019s also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, McNally told CNN last year. McNally compared the light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee. US oil refineries are specifically built to separate out the \u201cheavy and gunky\u201d crude we consume, McNally said. From CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen\u00a0 Pompeo falsely\u00a0claims Biden \u2018won\u2019t even talk about\u2019\u00a0American hostages\u00a0in Gaza Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on Thursday that President Joe Biden \u201cwon\u2019t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held\u201d in Gaza. \u201cAnd now of course a second war in Gaza. President Biden won\u2019t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held there by the Iranian regime,\u201d Pompeo said. Facts First: The claim that Biden \u201cwon\u2019t even talk about\u201d the American hostages in Gaza is false. Biden has spoken about the Americans held in Gaza in the wake of Hamas\u2019 invasion of Israel several times since October.  Recently on May 31, speaking about a proposed deal for Israel and Hamas, Biden said American hostages would be released in the first phase of the deal: \u201c[W]e want them home.\u201d On October 25, Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock together with our partners in\u00a0the region to secure the release of hostages including American citizens \u2026 left behind.\u201d On November 26, he spoke extensively about the release of an Israeli American little girl who was held hostage and said he was pressing for more Americans to be released, adding, \u201cwe will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones.\u201d Most recently, at the NATO Summit in DC last week, Biden talked about hostages broadly, saying the US \u201chas been working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, to bring the hostages home, to create a path for peace and stability in the Middle East.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump biographical video includes false and misleading claims The Republican National Convention played a biographical video about former President Donald Trump before Trump began his own speech. The video included false and misleading claims. The Trump tax cuts The video featured a narrator making a claim that Trump himself\u00a0frequently utters. The narrator said, \u201cThe Trump tax cuts: largest in America\u2019s history.\u201d This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. You can read a detailed fact check here. Global conflict under Trump The video\u2019s narrator also delivered a version of another claim Trump has\u00a0made repeatedly, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cstrength and resolve\u201d produced \u201ca stable\u00a0world at peace.\u201d This claim about world peace under Trump is false, too. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021. US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa\u2019s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico\u2019s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021. Americans\u2019 incomes  While attacking President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, the video featured on-screen text that said,\u00a0\u201cU.S. incomes fall for third straight year,\u201d attributing those words to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0article\u00a0in 2023. An image of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was shown on screen at the same time. This combination of words and images is misleading. The video didn\u2019t acknowledge that the first of the three straight years in which the Wall Street Journal article reported that inflation-adjusted median household income went down\u00a0was 2020, when Trump was president.\u00a0(The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline.) Real median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Eric Trump\u2019s false claims about the economy and US global standing in 2016 Eric Trump told the crowd at the RNC Thursday that the \u201ceconomy was struggling, jobs were scarce\u201d and the US had poor standing on the global stage when his father was elected president in 2016. Facts First: Eric Trump\u2019s claims are false. When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he inherited a strong economy, including a robust labor market, and a nation that was viewed favorably on the global stage. In 2016, the US added an average of nearly 194,000 jobs per month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In the two years before, those average gains were even higher: 226,000 in 2015 and nearly 250,000 in 2014. Job gains remained above historical averages in 2017 through 2019, with 177,000 jobs added on average per month. Eric Trump\u2019s claims that jobs were scarce in 2016 were not accurate. In fact, the US labor market experienced its longest expansion on record starting in 2010 and continuing until March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic crippled global economies, including that of the US. In addition to inheriting a labor market in good shape, the economy was growing when Trump took office. Real gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic activity \u2013 typically grows between 2% and 3%, and it averaged 2.4% between 2014-2016 and then nearly 2.7% during the first three years of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Also, the US was well regarded internationally when Barack Obama left office, and those sentiments plunged at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Pompeo\u2019s claim about the southern border under Trump Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that the US-Mexico border was \u201cclosed\u201d during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Facts First: Pompeo\u2019s claim is false.  While Trump tightened the border during his tenure, illegal crossings into the US from Mexico still numbered in the tens of thousands each month leading up to when he left office. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration limited non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border and prohibited migrants from crossing it in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. President Joe Biden later extended the restrictions. The former president\u2019s biggest effort to \u201cclose\u201d the border was met with resistance by federal courts, and the Supreme Court later gave Biden the green light to end the controversial \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. From CNN\u2019s Devan Cole Trump makes false claims about election fraud in RNC video For the fourth straight night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use \u201cevery appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,\u201d including voting by mail.\u00a0Trump\u00a0relentlessly disparaged\u00a0mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has\u00a0continued to sharply criticize\u00a0it during the current campaign But Trump\u2019s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would \u201conce and for all secure our elections\u201d as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, \u201cWe never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.\u201d\u00a0And he said, \u201cKeep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it\u2019s the only thing they do well.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims are nonsense \u2013 slightly vaguer versions of his\u00a0usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and\u00a0stolen\u00a0and\u00a0that Democrats\u00a0are serial election cheaters.\u00a0The\u00a02020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump\u2019s opponents excel. The Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said\u00a0in a post-election November 2020 statement: \u201cThe November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d \u00a0From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Pompeo\u2019s false claim about spy balloons Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday evening that under former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, \u201cnot a single Chinese spy balloon flew across\u201d the US. \u201cWe\u2019d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,\u201d Pompeo said. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false. Three suspected Chinese spy balloons\u00a0transited over the continental US\u00a0during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u00a0said in 2023\u00a0that a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d allowed the balloons to travel undetected. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Linda McMahon\u2019s misleading claim on tariffs Linda McMahon, who served in the Trump administration as the Small Business Administrator, suggested at the Republican National Convention Thursday that China paid the tariffs that the former president put on roughly $300 billion of Chinese-made goods. \u201cInstead of taxing American companies, Donald Trump put tariffs on China that raised billions of dollars and protected American industries,\u201d she said. Facts First: This characterization of Trump\u2019s tariffs is misleading.  It\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s tariffs on China raised billions of dollars for the US government, but the duties were paid by US companies \u2013 not China. Study after study, including one from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission (USITC), has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products. Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods \u2013 whether that\u2019s a retailer or a consumer. Many economists agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers. \u201cA tariff is just a form of a tax,\u201d Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN earlier this year. Tariffs can benefit some companies by raising the prices of competing foreign-made goods, but the duties can hurt other companies by raising component parts they need to manufacture. For example, Trump\u2019s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector \u2013 but that industry lost jobs. Federal Reserve economists\u00a0found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That\u2019s mostly because goods became more expensive to US consumers. Plus,\u00a0retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco RNC video featuring Reagan\u2019s voice misleadingly twists magazine article A video played on the final night of the Republican National Convention tried to attack President Joe Biden by featuring quotes from then-candidate Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous rhetorical questions about the President Jimmy Carter era at a presidential debate against Carter in 1980. At one point, the video featured Reagan\u2019s voice asking if, compared to four years ago,\u00a0\u201cIs America as respected throughout the world as it was?\u201d On-screen text answered the question with the words \u201callies no longer trust the United States,\u201d attributing them to a September 2021 article in Foreign Affairs magazine. Facts First: This quote is misleading. The article in Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t actually declare that allies no longer trust the United States. Rather, the article noted that \u201ccritics of President Joe Biden\u201d make the \u201cclaim\u201d that allies no longer trust the US after Biden\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2013 but the article then went on to argue that \u201cthese concerns about credibility are overblown.\u201d The convention video also featured Reagan\u2019s voice asking, \u201cIs there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?\u201d But if you go back precisely four years from the most recent unemployment rate, the answer is: less unemployment. The current unemployment rate is 4.1% for June 2024; four years prior, in June 2020, the unemployment rate was 11.0% amid the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a reasonable basis for this part of the video, though, if you interpret \u201cfour years ago\u201d more broadly to refer to any time in 2020. Before the pandemic, in the first two months of 2020, the unemployment rates were 3.6% and 3.5%.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden has decided not to run for reelection, following his disastrous debate performance last month and his failure since to convince his fellow Democrats that he can defeat former President Donald Trump in the fall. Democrats\u00a0now\u00a0have an unprecedented challenge given the traditional primary season has long since ended. Biden on Sunday\u00a0endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrats\u2019 nominee this fall, but he can\u2019t automatically make her the candidate. As\u00a0we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February, individual delegates\u00a0will now select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign.\u00a0So it will\u00a0largely be Biden backers who will be\u00a0picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? The president, in a post on X, endorsed Harris. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. However, it isn\u2019t exactly clear how those rules would be applied in this case. The number of superdelegates can also shift if one dies or resigns. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the longtime Texas congresswoman, died July 19, reducing the number of superdelegates by one. How would other candidates get into the race? Under party rules, candidates must meet certain requirements to have their names placed into nomination to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate. They must gather hundreds of signatures from delegates (at least 300, but not more than 600) from several states (no more than 50 of the signatures may come from one state). No delegate can sign more than one petition, and signatures can come from either pledged or super delegates. Candidates also must meet a series of requirements laid out in party rules, including that they are a \u201cbona fide Democrat\u201d and that they have \u201cestablished substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate\u201d for president. While this determination is to be made by the DNC national chairperson, the party has not yet released more details on how exactly the process would work. How does the nomination vote work? Democrats are in the process of setting up a system to conduct their presidential nomination vote remotely before the convention. Under a proposed plan outlined Friday to the convention rules committee, it would be up to party chair Jaime Harrison and convention chair Minyon Moore to set a specific date for voting to begin, but it would be no earlier than August 1. Under the plan presented Friday, delegates would get 24 hours\u2019 notice before voting begins, and voting would take place via digital ballots emailed to delegates, similarly to how the party conducted its virtual voting before the largely remote 2020 convention.\u00a0In 2020, voting ran for nearly two weeks; and according to Andrew Binns, a senior adviser to the convention, of the 4,747 ballots it sent out, only 14 were not returned. This year, delegates would also have a set window of time to vote, but the party did not specify how long that period would be. During the meeting, party officials continued to call for Biden to be officially nominated before August 7, to avoid the risk of litigation over his access to the ballot in Ohio. While the state pushed the deadline back to September 1 earlier this year, the new law won\u2019t take effect until the end of August. However, the committee did not take any steps to approve the plan at Friday\u2019s meeting. Members were planning on meeting next week to do so, and given the news, it\u2019s not yet clear if the party will be sticking with the remote vote plan, or if it will scrap it and allow the formal vote to happen on the convention floor. Are Democratic delegates required to vote for the candidate who won them? Under Democratic party rules, pledged delegates \u201cshall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d However, the candidates\u2019 right of review means that delegates can be expected to be loyal to the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged. But now that Biden is no longer a candidate, his delegates are free to vote for whomever they\u2019d like. He doesn\u2019t need to formally \u201crelease\u201d his delegates. How does the candidate for vice president get determined? Under party rules, the election of a candidate for vice president is conducted in largely the same manner as the vote for president, except that superdelegates are allowed to vote on every ballot for vice president. In practice, however, there is typically not a roll call vote for vice president, with the presidential nominee\u2019s choice for the position typically nominated by acclamation. The party\u2019s presentation to the rules committee did not include any detail on how the vice presidential nominee would be determined under the virtual roll call proposal. In 2020, when the party used a similar virtual roll call, the Democratic process functionally allowed the winning candidate for president (Biden) to nominate the vice presidential candidate (Harris) without the need for an additional roll call. Will the Democratic nominee have any trouble getting on the ballot? After the convention nominates a candidate, many election law experts say they won\u2019t have much or any trouble getting on all 51 presidential ballots. Unlike independent candidates, the Democratic and Republican nominees for president don\u2019t need to gather signatures to appear on the ballot. Instead, the major parties, by virtue of their popularity, enjoy automatic ballot access in every state. While the process varies by state, the parties typically submit their nominees\u2019 names (and the names of candidates for presidential elector) to the state. Biden hasn\u2019t been officially nominated and the party hasn\u2019t submitted his name to state officials. So the new nominee wouldn\u2019t be, in an official sense,\u00a0replacing\u00a0Biden. Whoever the delegates select will be the Democratic nominee and they\u00a0shouldn\u2019t have an issue\u00a0taking the Democratic ballot line. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there wouldn\u2019t be the possibility of litigation, even if it would be unlikely to succeed. This story has been updated following Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the race.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_electoral-votes-swing-state-margins-dg", "text": "Anyone who pays any attention to US politics is bound to hear some version of this claim: The 2024 election, which will pick a president for a nation of more than 330 million people, will be decided by a small number of voters in a few key states. There are concerns, particularly among Democrats, that President Joe Biden is losing support in these key states and they have pressured him to step aside for a different candidate. But even an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump and questions about Biden\u2019s fitness to serve another four years might not interrupt the larger dynamic of the race. \u201cI still think that this is a race where we are not going to see the polls move outside a pretty narrow window,\u201d Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN during coverage of the Republican National Convention. \u201cIf you liked Donald Trump last week, you still like him this week. If you liked Joe Biden last week, you still like him this week,\u201d she said. With those perceptions set, consider just how small the margins were in the 2020 election, consider that the states Biden turned from red to blue to defeat then-President Trump were won by securing a tiny fraction of voters in those states. In a 2024 rematch between the two, Trump will try to win those same states back from Biden, the Democrat aiming to win another term in the White House in November. The margins could be just as close. But to say that a small number of voters \u201cdecide\u201d the election is a major oversimplification of the American system and how it has evolved. Here\u2019s how things work: There are 538 Electoral College votes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation. The smallest states get three (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more. California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts). Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on. The winner is the candidate who gets 270 or more electoral votes. If no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes, the House of Representatives picks the winner from among the candidates who got electoral votes. A dozen states were decided by 5 percentage points or less in either the 2016 or 2020 presidential election. In CNN\u2019s 2024 race ratings, Maine is the only one of these states rated as solidly in one party\u2019s corner, but one congressional district within Maine is classified as a toss-up. The other 11 states are seen as competitive in the 2024 election.\u00a0See the ratings here. Viewed another way, we can expect that those states where the previous elections have been close to be the ones where the 2024 election will again be close. Polling backs up this presumption. In real numbers, the close margins in those relatively few states equal a very small number of voters in a country of more than 330 million people, but they are necessary for either candidate to reach an Electoral College count of 270. Some of those states came down to tens of thousands of votes. Biden won for Democrats in five states in 2020 \u2013 Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 where Hillary Clinton lost, often by very small margins, in 2016. Florida, on the other hand, which has been a battleground for years, went more toward Trump in 2020. The campaigns will focus more attention on the fewer than one-third of all electoral votes they consider to be up for grabs or winnable by either party. Another thing to consider is that the number of electoral votes was reallocated after the 2020 election due to the every-10-years census required by the Constitution. North Carolina, Colorado and Florida, potential battlegrounds, each gained an electoral vote. Texas, which Democrats have long hoped would become a battleground but which continues to tilt Republican despite shifting demographics, also gained two votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan are among the states that lost a vote. That also means that the populations of these states are changing over time. A battleground in 2024 could look very different in the future. And states that seem safe for either party today could be battlegrounds in the future. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, apportion some of their electoral votes by congressional district rather than giving all of them to the state winner. In 2020, for instance, Biden won a single vote in Nebraska and Trump won a single vote in Maine. These individual electoral votes could be incredibly important in the event of a tight election this year. The end result is that, yes, the 2024 election could again come down to relatively few voters in relatively few states. But questions remain over who those decisive voters are. Are they the voters who make most states reliably red or blue in most elections? Are they suburban women who were turned off by Trump in 2020, or are they people without a college degree who have moved toward the GOP? Are they older voters who have been trending toward Democrats or younger voters expressing an interest in Republicans? Are they more disinterested voters who only take part in the process every now and then, or is it a question of which party successfully motivates its stalwarts to turn out no matter what? It will take all of the above for either candidate to win. However, because the margins in certain states could be so small, incremental shifts in the preference or turnout of any larger group of voters could be decisive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/electoral-votes-swing-state-margins-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_lbj-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is the first president in more than a generation to decide not to seek a second term. But Biden\u2019s situation is unique in American politics. He had planned to run and won nearly every delegate to the Democratic National Convention next month. Questions about his age and acuity ultimately convinced him to pull out of the presidential race. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be his successor as the Democratic presidential nominee. Biden announced his decision in a letter posted to social media after weeks of fevered speculation, making him one of a handful of presidents who decided to step aside rather than seek reelection. Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here\u2019s part of that address: It is a remarkable speech to watch today. Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded. By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson\u2019s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted. Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16. Health was a concern for LBJ Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term. \u201cThere\u2019s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,\u201d Updegrove said. \u201cHe had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn\u2019t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,\u201d Updegrove added. A year of incredible uncertainty 1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson\u2019s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty. Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities. In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent. In 1968, Democrats ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside. That November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states. Johnson remains one of the country\u2019s most transformative presidents Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a \u201cgreat society,\u201d including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty. Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South. This story has been updated following President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to exit the presidential race.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_biden-ambition-democracy-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden ran for reelection to save democracy. In the end, he came to the shattering realization he could only do so by ceding power himself. Biden reached the decision to end his campaign after days in isolation at his Delaware beach house with Covid-19 and after watching many Democrats desert the president who led them to power just four years ago. In offering to hand over power in service of what he saw as the national interest, he struck a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who fought bitterly against leaving office after losing a free and fair election to Biden in 2020. It\u2019s ironic that Republicans who whitewashed Trump\u2019s election-stealing effort are now accusing Democrats of crushing the will of primary voters who voted for the president\u2019s reelection bid. \u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\u201d Biden said in a letter he posted to X on Sunday afternoon. \u201cAnd while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\u201d Biden quickly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, but his late-in-the campaign decision sets off a potentially chaotic and divisive rush to rally behind a Democratic nominee in the month before the party convention in Chicago and less than four months before the election. The Biden campaign effectively ended in the 20 first, faltering minutes of his debate against Trump last month, when the president looked confused, exhausted and was unable to take the attack to his foe or to make an effective case for himself. His struggles validated concerns of majorities of voters that he would be too old for a second term that would have ended when he is 86. His fervent efforts to save his campaign in television interviews and campaign appearances only exacerbated the concerns about his showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta. Three weeks of severe erosion in his political position saw a daily drip of defections from Democratic lawmakers, while party grandees like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed from behind the scenes. The drying up of donor cash also seemed to make Biden\u2019s campaign unsustainable. Even if he wanted to go on, it became clear that he couldn\u2019t. Still Biden, proud and defiant, resisted every effort to push him out of the race, insisting, along with his loyal inner core of staff, that there was no other Democrat better qualified or more likely to beat Trump, whom the president views as an existential threat to American democracy and the country\u2019s soul. But in the end, Biden could not find a way to make voters unsee the poignant picture of an 81-year-old commander in chief who appeared to have seriously declined and was stumbling in the debate. Legislative record overshadowed by inflation Biden\u2019s impressive legislative record, which bears comparison with any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson, was one of the reasons why he resisted attempts to push him out of the race, saying he wanted to finish the job. Becoming the oldest president ever elected, he was 78 when he took office. Biden declared in his inaugural address that the American political system of checks and balances had held and triumphed over Trump\u2019s election lies \u2013 not knowing at the time that the ex-president\u2019s threat to democracy would only grow. The new president immediately set about tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst public health emergency in 100 years, which had been exacerbated by Trump\u2019s mismanagement and politicization of his own government\u2019s public health guidelines. Biden enacted a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package that the White House credited with helping to drive unemployment to near 50-year lows and spurring a faster rebound for the US economy than for other developed nations. Biden also passed a $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act and a bipartisan infrastructure package that had eluded other recent presidents. But Biden badly underestimated the threat from inflation, which rose to 40-year-highs. While the cost of living has eased, many Americans are still feeling the punishing blowback from high grocery prices and elevated interest rates \u2013 which offered Trump an opening. Overseas, Biden responded forcibly to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, becoming the most important leader of the West since the end of the Cold War with his efforts to reinvigorate NATO. But the chaotic US exit from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 hurt Biden\u2019s self-proclaimed status as a foreign policy expert, and his handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza damaged his standing with parts of his base. A painful decision for a president who abandoned two previous campaigns The soul searching that Biden endured led to a decision that in some ways represents a humiliating end for a politician who spent years pursuing the highest office and was frequently passed over in his climb to power. It is not an easy thing for a president \u2014 the most powerful person in the world \u2014 to separate his personal ambition from the fate of the nation. And the debilitating distancing that took place between top Democrats and Biden in recent weeks was a cruel lesson in the brutality of politics, given that the president had ejected Trump from power after the most tumultuous presidency in modern times. It must be an especially bitter pill for Biden that he will not be able to take the fight to Trump, who has spent the last three years saying he was too infirm and mentally diminished to effectively serve as president. The ignominy of being effectively forced to shelve his reelection bid will also be painful for the president since he\u2019s had to abandon two White House campaigns before \u2014 in 1987 after he was caught plagiarizing a British politician and in 2008 after he failed to gain traction in a blockbuster race that was dominated by Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. Sunday\u2019s denouement was also the latest harrowing turn in a life of tragedy that saw Biden lose his first wife and infant daughter to a car crash when he\u2019d been elected to the Senate from Delaware. He had to bury another child in 2015 when his beloved son Beau died of brain cancer. And in recent years, the president has been dealing with the pressure and pain of helping his other son Hunter through the horror of addiction and a personal crisis that culminated in a criminal conviction on a gun charge earlier this year. Given his political and personal history, it was no surprise that Biden would dig in his heels as calls mounted from within the Democratic Party for him to quit the race. But the growing possibility that his legacy would be remembered not for ousting the most aberrant president in modern American history but for paving the way for an even more extreme second Trump term, set in motion the political forces that would extinguish his hopes. If Biden\u2019s gamble pays off and another Democratic candidate beats Trump, he may go down in history as one of the most successful one-term presidents in history. He will have enabled such a triumph by putting his own ambition on hold for the good of his party and the country. But his late exit will raise questions over whether he has saddled his party \u2014 and a Democratic successor \u2014 with an impossible task in standing up a campaign in a matter of days against a united Republican Party that emerged from its convention in Milwaukee last week convinced it was on a path to victory. Seeking a second term at the age of 81 turned out to be an impossible mission \u2014 and, despite his efforts, Biden may have saved his party huge problems had he reached the same conclusion before the primary season started. If history is a guide, Biden\u2019s rock bottom approval ratings will spike in the coming days. When Johnson announced he would not run for a second term in his own right in 1968, he was greeted by massive crowds in subsequent public events around the country. Johnson made his move in March, during the primary campaign, and his departure set off a chaotic chain of events, worsened by the assassination of Democratic primary candidate Robert F. Kennedy, and a violence-plagued convention in Chicago \u2014 which will also host this year\u2019s event. In the end, the eventual Democratic nominee, then-Vice Pre\ufeffsident Hubert Humphrey, lost to Republican Richard Nixon. Years earlier, in March 1952, Harry S. Truman, another Democratic president, had decided not to seek his own second term. The Democratic nominee that year, Adlai Stevenson, lost to Republican Dwight Eisenhower. But if Biden does enjoy a burst of support for his selflessness \u2013 and even nostalgia for the successes of what is now a lame duck presidency \u2013 it might not translate to his successor. No modern president has ever bowed out of the presidential race at such a late date. And Harris, or whoever picks up the baton, now faces one of the most daunting missions in electoral history, against an opponent who has already proved there is nothing he will not do to win.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/biden-ambition-democracy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_harris-biden-trump-polling", "text": "It\u2019s just one day after President Joe Biden announced that he would end his reelection campaign and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee taking on former President Donald Trump in this year\u2019s presidential race. That\u2019s far too soon for polling to capture the dynamics of a fast-evolving campaign, but polling conducted before Biden\u2019s announcement provides some early indications of how a Harris for President campaign might try to improve on Biden\u2019s standing in the race. CNN\u2019s polling in late June tested Biden\u2019s support against Trump in the wake of the presidential debate, and it also looked at how Harris would fare in a hypothetical matchup with the former president. Overall, Harris held 45% support to Trump\u2019s 47% among registered voters nationwide, a result with no clear leader, within the poll\u2019s margin of sampling error. Biden trailed Trump by 6 points in the same poll. Harris outperformed Biden against Trump among women \u2013 notably among women of color and suburban women \u2013 and political independents, and she held an advantage over Trump among voters who said they weren\u2019t fully locked in to their presidential choices. The data also suggests Harris fared somewhat better than Biden among younger voters, a particular point of concern for Democrats during the campaign so far. Here\u2019s a look at some of the key numbers: Women: Harris held the support of 50% of women registered voters to Trump\u2019s 43%, while Biden only held the support of 44% of women to Trump\u2019s 47%. Among suburban women, a key segment of Biden\u2019s coalition in 2020, Harris held 55% support to Trump\u2019s 39%, while Biden stood at 49% to Trump\u2019s 43%. Men broke for Trump by about 10 points regardless of whether the Democrat was Biden or Harris. Independents and movable voters:\u00a0Harris split political independents about evenly with Trump, 43% said they supported her and 40% Trump. Biden, however, trailed Trump by 10 points among that same group of independent voters, 44% Trump to 34% Biden. Movable voters, those who either didn\u2019t have a first choice or said they could change their minds about Biden vs. Trump, said they were more apt to back Harris over Trump than to favor Biden over the former president. While these voters split 39% Trump to 37% Biden, Harris had considerably more support with this group, which broke in her favor 47% Harris to 34% Trump. Voters who said their choices were already locked in were about the same in both matchups, suggesting those solid Biden voters are quite likely to become Harris voters should she become the party\u2019s nominee: Those who said they\u2019d made up their minds split 53% Trump to 45% Biden, and it was 53% Trump to 45% Harris among that same group. Voters of color:\u00a0Most voters of color supported the vice president over the former president, 58% Harris to 29% Trump, while this group split 54% Biden to 33% Trump in that matchup. Among women of color, Harris outperformed Biden by 10 points: 63% of women of color said they backed Harris over Trump, compared with 53% who said the same about Biden. Younger voters:\u00a0Harris fares better among younger voters than Biden did, though her support in the poll still lags behind the level that Democratic presidential candidates have received in recent cycles. Among voters younger than 35, 42% backed Harris to 41% for Trump, compared with 47% Trump to 41% Biden among that same group. It\u2019s important to note that voters\u2019 take on a Harris vs. Trump race at the time of the CNN poll was largely hypothetical \u2013 Biden had not stepped aside, and there was no precedent for such a move in the era of the presidential primary system \u2013 so the results here are more suggestive of what might happen than a read on what is happening now that the matchup appears to be a reality. Voters\u2019 impressions of candidates can and do change once they\u2019ve gone from hypothetical to declared candidates, so the way voters felt about it in late June may not match what they say when asked about a Harris-Trump matchup in the wake of Biden\u2019s decision to step aside. The poll suggests there is some room for views of Harris to change. Among registered voters, 32% said they had a favorable impression of her, 53% an unfavorable one, with roughly 15% saying they either hadn\u2019t heard of her or didn\u2019t yet know enough to say. Among those without firm opinions about her, Harris held a lead over Trump, 57% to 22%, suggesting a key challenge going forward will be keeping these voters on board as they learn more about her.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-biden-trump-polling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_politics_for-trump-an-incredible-week-since-escaping-death", "text": "Donald Trump may not have changed in the past week, but the presidential race clearly has. In the seven days since his brush with an assassin\u2019s bullet, Trump has: \u25ba Had supporters speak reverently about their view of God\u2019s plan to save his life, elevating him to an almost divine status. \u25ba Verifiably unified Republicans around him at a rousing Republican convention. \u25ba Seen former rivals like Nikki Haley sing his praises. \u25ba Benefited when a judge he appointed dismissed a criminal case against him in Florida. \u25ba Watched President Joe Biden be isolated by the growing number of Democrats who worry he can\u2019t beat him. \u25ba Read polling that suggests he has an edge in what has previously looked like a neck-and-neck race. Convention weeks are always supposed to be a moment for a presidential candidate and his party to put on a show and unify their party before the election, but this week has been something apart for Trump. Pairing his momentum with Democrats\u2019 concern about Biden has changed the race. Biden is essentially under siege as a growing number of Democrats call on him to step aside, arguing it\u2019s the right thing to protect his legacy and give them a chance in November. If Biden were to look for inspiration on how to overcome the naysayers, he could find it in Trump. The former president has improbably, despite a criminal conviction in New York and owing hundreds of millions for defamation and business fraud, emerged from purgatory after he tried to over throw the 2020 election results, to claim his reward, his name flashing in Broadway lights at the Republican National Convention. Many Americans will probably encounter on social media the riveting earlier portion of the nomination acceptance speech, where he recounted his near-death experience, embraced of the divine intervention theory of his survival and honored the fire chief who died in the attempted assassination, kissing his fire helmet. But what came later in his 90 minutes on the stage, when Trump rambled off-script, was a rally-style airing of his grievances and factually incorrect boasts about his record. If the focus ever turns from Democrats\u2019 drama back to him, that kind of speechifying could bring back memories of his chaotic years in office. Back on the trail Trump returns to the campaign trail Saturday in his first joint rally with his running mate Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. They are scheduled to speak at an arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Michigan is one of the key bricks in the so-called Blue Wall, which also includes Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. When Democrats win those states, they can win the White House. But while Democrats are focused on whether Biden will be their nominee, and he recovers from a Covid-19 diagnosis, Trump and Vance are free to campaign without answer. Up in the polls Trump is over 50% nationally in a poll of likely voters released Thursday by CBS News and YouGov. Trump\u2019s lead in the polls suggests he could become the first Republican to win the national popular vote in 20 years, since incumbent President George W. Bush defeated Democratic Sen. John Kerry in 2004. More trouble for Biden Interestingly, most Democratic registered voters in the CBS News poll, 56%, do not think Biden should drop out. Lawmakers are taking a different view. Democrats\u2019 efforts to edge Biden out of the race are an acknowledgment both that Biden trails in the presidential race and also a function of House and Senate Democrats hoping to change the conversation in their own races. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, joined the list of Democrats calling on Biden to step aside. In a letter to Biden, she said she would support his candidacy if he stays in the race and work to help him win. But\u2026 \u201cUnfortunately, I greatly doubt that the outcome will be positive and our country will pay a dreadful price for that,\u201d she said. Shooting motive remains a mystery Investigators continue to be puzzled by what motivated the alleged shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by a counter-sniper moments after firing shots from the roof of a building outside the perimeter at Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a week ago. In the intervening days, CNN has learned that Crooks searched for information on both Trump and Biden, including for details about the Democratic National Convention. Crooks also searched for information about Ethan Crumbley, the mass shooter who killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021. Crumbley\u2019s parents were recently sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter. CNN has also reported that Trump\u2019s campaign was not told by Secret Service before he took the stage for the open air rally in Butler that law enforcement was searching for a suspicious individual who turned out to be Crooks. Republicans have called on the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to be fired and a Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee posted video of lawmakers loudly pursuing Cheatle, demanding answers during the Republican convention. Regardless of what motivated Crooks or how he was able get on the roof and fire at Trump, his attack on Trump could be a pivotal moment for the country since it has imbued Trump\u2019s campaign with a sense of righteousness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/politics/for-trump-an-incredible-week-since-escaping-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}

He must resign the office immediately,\u201d Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement Sunday afternoon. Biden\u00a0ended his reelection bid and endorsed\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0to succeed him on Sunday, in a major and historic move that upends the presidential race. \u201cHaving invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president, the self-proclaimed \u2018party of democracy\u2019 has proven exactly the opposite,\u201d Johnson said. As speaker of the House, Johnson is second in the line of presidential succession behind Harris. The White House said that Biden is \u201clooking forward to finishing his term\u201d when asked about some congressional Republicans who are calling on Biden to step down from the presidency. Biden also said in his initial statement that he will complete his term. \u201cPresident Biden inherited an economy in freefall, a skyrocketing violent crime rate, and alliances in tatters from his predecessor. He turned that around to deliver the strongest economic growth in the world and the lowest violent crime rate in nearly 50 years, while making NATO bigger than ever. He looks forward to finishing his term and delivering more historic results for the American people,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN. Bates continued: \u201cThat includes continuing to lower costs, create jobs, and protect Social Security while standing against the MAGAnomics agenda that would worsen inflation and drive us into recession. And he\u2019ll keep fighting to protect Americans\u2019 freedoms from radical abortion bans and attacks on the rule of law.\u201d Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell in a statement similarly accused the Democratic Party of \u201ctrying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country.\u201d In contrast, however, McConnell did not call on Biden to resign the presidency. While other Republican senators and members of Congress call for Biden\u00a0to resign and accuse Democrats of disregarding their own primary results, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska praised the president for his decision. \u201cI respect President Biden\u2019s decision to act in the best interest of the country by stepping aside in the 2024 presidential election,\u201d she said. GOP Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina said that she plans to introduce a resolution on Monday that calls on Harris to invoke the 25th\u00a0Amendment and assume Biden\u2019s duties. \u201cIf Joe Biden does not have the cognitive ability to seek reelection, he does not have the cognitive ability to serve the remainder of his term,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_21_politics_delegates-democratic-ticket-harris", "text": "Democratic convention delegates are draining the political drama from Joe Biden\u2019s decision to give up the presidential nomination by quickly coalescing around his chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris. The North Carolina\u00a0and Tennessee delegations\u00a0came out in unanimous support of Harris late Sunday. South Carolina Democrats also delivered a public vote of confidence. Harris\u2019 swift ascent provides some rare good news for Democrats who have been agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate for weeks. Biden\u2019s endorsement has weight, but no formal bearing on the process.\u00a0The makeup of ticket now rests with\u00a0the roughly 4,700 delegates\u00a0who will, in the coming weeks, vote for a new standard-bearer. Interviews with more than two dozen delegates in the immediate aftermath of Biden\u2019s announcement suggest the vice president is the clear leader. Delegates pledged to Biden are under no obligation to support his choice, but their loyalty to him and his wishes suggests the lion\u2019s share will quickly fall in line behind Harris. Many already have; some are now contacting other delegates, with no input yet from Harris\u2019 campaign, to shore up her support. \u201cEvery one of us (delegates) were vetted and worked for Biden or the Biden campaign in some way, whether we volunteered or donated or something. These are all Biden people,\u201d said Joe Caiazzo, a Biden delegate from Massachusetts who praised the president\u2019s \u201cselfless, patriotic\u201d decision. What follows is less than certain \u2013 and unprecedented in modern political history. Current party rules were largely designed to pass the nominating process off to primary voters and ahead of an orderly, made-for-TV roll call vote to confirm their choice. But that pro forma process is not set in stone. The Democratic National Committee will likely need to do more work, either through interpretation of their existing rules or by passing new ones, to clarify the next steps. \u201cIn short order, the American people will hear from the Democratic Party on next steps and the path forward for the nomination process,\u201d DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said on Sunday. Even before Biden\u2019s bolt landed, Democrats were at odds over when and how the nominating vote would take place. Under a proposed plan outlined Friday to the convention rules committee, it would be up to Harrison and convention chair Minyon Moore to set a specific date for voting to begin, though not before August 1. Delegates would vote via digital ballots, with at least 24 hours\u2019 notice, much like they did in 2020 during the largely remote convention. That year, voting ran for nearly two weeks and, of the 4,747 ballots they sent out, only over a dozen were not returned, according to Andrew Binns, a senior adviser to the convention. An open letter from more than 75 current and former DNC members, shared with CNN, praised Biden for his decision to give way \u201cto a new generation of public servants\u201d and insisted that Harris is \u201cthe only person that can credibly claim the torch from the Biden-Harris Administration.\u201d \u201cWe also firmly believe that Vice President Harris and her Vice Presidential selection will help Democratic candidates for U.S. House, Senate, and in the states we need to win in November, enabling us to enact laws that truly benefit the American people,\u201d the authors said, addressing one of the concerns that led so many Democratic lawmakers to call for Biden to step aside. In the critical swing state of Michigan, where party chair Lavora Barnes almost immediately endorsed Biden, the leadership of the \u201cuncommitted\u201d movement \u2013 which won about 30 delegates during a protest campaign against the president\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2013 opened the door for Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s time to align our actions with our values,\u201d said Layla Elabed in a statement datelined Dearborn, a Detroit suburb where\u00a0more than half\u00a0of the population is of Middle Eastern or North African descent. \u201cVice President Harris can start the process to earn back trust by turning the page from Biden\u2019s horrific policies in Gaza.\u201d Harris made headlines in March when she called for a ceasefire in Gaza during a speech on the anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. One California delegate, who like others spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment in this pivotal moment, said he\u2019s \u201crelieved\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d after hearing Biden stepped down. The delegate, who wanted Biden to quit the race after seeing his shaky performance in last month\u2019s presidential debate, said he hoped Harris would replace Biden at the top of the ticket, calling her the \u201cstrongest\u201d candidate. Another California delegate said she\u2019s \u201cfeeling a huge sense of relief.\u201d She had privately been concerned about Biden\u2019s viability following the debate and hoped for weeks he would step aside. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go on like that any longer,\u201d the delegate said, \u201cwithout jeopardizing the entire election up and down the ballot.\u201d A Massachusetts delegate told CNN that while he still strongly supports Biden\u2019s agenda, the president\u2019s \u201cvision has failed to reach Americans.\u201d The delegate said he has not yet decided who to support for the nomination, and believes the party needs a leader who \u201ccan help Americans understand what\u2019s at stake.\u201d Another erstwhile Biden delegate from Colorado said, \u201cIt is long overdue that there is a competitive nomination for president\u201d at the Democratic convention. She also told CNN she\u2019s not yet decided on who to support for the nomination. When asked about Harris, the delegate said she\u2019s not convinced the vice president can win in November. \u201cIt is not clear that (Harris) is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d she said. A delegate from Florida told CNN he\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d Biden dropped out and said Democrats owe Biden \u201ca debt of gratitude\u201d for winning the 2020 election and \u201csetting up Democrats to defeat Trump again.\u201d He said he\u2019s taking his cues from Biden and plans to back Harris, who has been making calls to Democratic lawmakers asking for their support as she tries to consolidate the party over the coming days. In South\u00a0Carolina, one\u00a0Democratic delegate told CNN they were \u201csad\u201d to hear the news, noting that the Palmetto State had been so critical in Biden\u2019s primary victory four years ago. \u201cWe saved and relaunched Biden\u2019s campaign, so it\u2019s sad to see his electoral career \u2013 that we take a lot of pride in - come to an end,\u201d the delegate said, while also warning that this affection and loyalty would not necessarily be passed on to Harris. The delegate told CNN they would prefer Harris \u201cwins in a competitive process,\u201d reasoning that that \u201cshe\u2019d be a stronger nominee if she isn\u2019t anointed.\u201d\u00a0Though getting the support of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state\u2019s most powerful Democrats and a close Biden ally, could settle the matter, \u201cHe\u2019s still the titan of politics in\u00a0South\u00a0Carolina,\u201d the delegate said. \u201cIs he going to put his full shoulder into whipping for Harris? That\u2019s all unanswered,\u201d In a statement issued shortly after Biden\u2019s, Harris on Sunday confirmed she is running for president and said she was \u201chonored\u201d to receive Biden\u2019s endorsement. Harris said she intends to \u201cearn and win\u201d the presidential nomination in her first public statement since Biden\u2019s stunning announcement. \u201cOver the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\u201d Harris said, before hinting at the condensed timeframe. \u201cWe have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\u201d Shasti Conrad, chair of the Washington state Democrats, said the party is currently calling all their delegates to get a \u201ctemperature check\u201d and make sure everyone has up-to-date information on the process ahead. They have a group call scheduled for later Sunday. Conrad, who officially endorsed Harris, is the first South Asian women to lead a state party and said she is \u201cthrilled\u201d that Harris is on track to become the nominee. \u201cIt really means that we are fully a part of this American story,\u201d Conrad said, \u201cand that people who look like her and look like myself in this country have a place in leadership.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/politics/delegates-democratic-ticket-harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_takeaways-trump-shooting-secret-service-cheatle-hearing", "text": "US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle faced off Monday with angry lawmakers from both parties, who grilled her over the stunning security failures that led to the recent assassination attempt against Donald Trump. Cheatle acknowledged that there were \u201csignificant\u201d problems at Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, where the former president was shot in the ear, and she didn\u2019t downplay the historical and political significance of the event. Before Trump\u00a0took the stage at the rally, the director said, the\u00a0Secret Service had been notified \u201cbetween two and five times\u201d that there was a suspicious person in the area. Yet one by one, as members of the House Oversight Committee tried to pry loose new information about the security breakdown and what is being done to ensure it never happens again, Cheatle repeatedly stonewalled lawmakers\u2019 efforts to get answers and pointed to the ongoing FBI investigation. The director also\u00a0remained defiant\u00a0in the face of bipartisan calls for her immediate resignation, including from Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee. Here are key takeaways from Monday\u2019s hearing: Cheatle admits \u2018colossal failure,\u2019 but won\u2019t resign Right off the bat, Cheatle\u00a0acknowledged\u00a0that the Trump assassination attempt was \u201cthe most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades.\u201d She later said it was the worst moment for the agency since the unsuccessful assassination attempt targeting President Ronald Reagan in 1981. But even with that historic failure under her watch, Cheatle was insistent that she won\u2019t step down. A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers called for her to resign her post. The criticism was sharper from Republicans, but Democrats also prodded Cheatle to let go. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna pointed out that the Secret Service director who ran the agency when Reagan was shot eventually resigned from his post. (That director resigned eight months following the assassination attempt.) \u201cDo you really, genuinely, in your heart, believe that you being in this role is what\u2019s right for America at this moment?\u201d Khanna asked. \u201cI will remain on, and be responsible to the agency, to this committee, to the former president, and to the American public,\u201d Cheatle replied, touting her nearly 30-year record working up the agency\u2019s ranks. Earlier in the hearing,\u00a0she said, \u201cI think I am the best person to lead the Secret Service at this time.\u201d Under tough questioning from GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, Cheatle conceded that the incident was a \u201ccolossal failure.\u201d\u00a0Mace ripped into Cheatle, telling her, \u201cyou\u2019re full of sh*t today\u201d because of her uncooperative posture throughout the hearing. No resources withheld from Trump rally, Cheatle says Rep. James Comer, the GOP chairman of the committee, pressed Cheatle over whether, prior to the shooting, Trump had been given all the security he requested. Cheatle said that \u201cfor the event on July 13, the assets that were requested for that day were given.\u201d CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that there were previous events where the Secret Service denied requests from Trump\u2019s security detail, though the agency instead, in some instances, provided other security measures from local law enforcement. GOP Rep. Jim Jordan also pressed Cheatle on whether she lied to the nation because \u2013 the morning after the shooting \u2013 the top spokesperson for the Secret Service\u00a0forcefully denied\u00a0allegations that the agency had rejected any requests for additional security. \u201cFor the event in Butler, there were no requests that were denied,\u201d Cheatle said. \u201cWell, maybe they got tired of asking,\u201d Jordan said. Cheatle\u2019s careful answers \u2013 and non-answers Cheatle frustrated lawmakers Monday as she walked a tightrope with her testimony, giving carefully worded answers and plenty of non-answers to tough questions. The top Republican and Democrat on the House Oversight Committee peppered Cheatle with some of the biggest questions that are still unresolved: Were any Secret Service agents on the roof where gunman\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks\u00a0fired shots at Trump? Did Crooks\u00a0fly a drone\u00a0over the area before the rally began? Why wasn\u2019t he stopped when people spotted him on the roof with a rifle? In response to these questions, and more, Cheatle pivoted away and didn\u2019t directly answer. Regarding Crooks\u2019 possible drone, she confirmed that this is what the FBI told her, but said it was still being probed. \u201cWe are just nine days out from this incident, and there\u2019s still an ongoing investigation,\u201d Cheatle said on a few occasions throughout the hearing. She also said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into specifics of that day.\u201d Cheatle revealed some details \u2013 like the fact that she has spoken with the counter-sniper who killed Crooks and that her agency didn\u2019t reject any requests from Trump\u2019s campaign for\u00a0additional security\u00a0at the specific rally in Butler. \u201cWe need to have confidence that if the FBI\u2019s leading this investigation, that they\u2019re leading a credible investigation,\u201d Comer told Cheatle directly. \u201cBecause there\u2019s some of us sitting up here that don\u2019t have a lot of confidence in the FBI.\u201d Democratic Rep. Shontel Brown later told Cheatle, \u201cYou\u2019re not making this easy for us,\u201d after a series of non-answers. Other lawmakers from both parties said they thought Cheatle was less forthcoming and candid in her sworn testimony at Monday\u2019s hearing than she was in her recent TV interviews. How was Trump allowed on stage? Before Trump took the stage on July 13, the Secret Service had been notified \u201cbetween two and five times\u201d that there was a suspicious person in the area, Cheatle said. She said the agency was still looking into the apparent communication breakdown \u2013 which led to Trump going onstage even amid these reports of a suspicious person, and as rallygoers saw Crooks with a gun in the immediate moments before the shots rang out. \u201cI have to assume that they did not know that there was a threat when they brought the president out on the stage,\u201d Cheatle said. However, there\u2019s \u201ca distinction between suspicious behavior and a threat,\u201d Cheatle explained, \u201cand at the time that this individual was identified, they were displaying suspicious behavior,\u201d and those early reports about Crooks didn\u2019t identify him as an active threat. When asked by GOP Rep. Russell Fry when exactly Crooks was identified as a threat, Cheatle said it was mere seconds before he started shooting at the former president. \u201cIt\u2019s approximately five minutes to where individuals relayed that there was an (issue) being worked at the three o\u2019clock of the former president,\u201d the lawmaker from South Carolina said, referring to Crooks\u2019 location from Trump\u2019s perspective. \u201cBut it was not phrased as a threat. It was just that something was being worked on. When did he transform from suspicion to threat?\u201d \u201cI believe that it was seconds before the gunfire started,\u201d Cheatle said. Democrats pivot to gun control In his\u00a0opening statement, Raskin homed in on the gun violence that has plagued the US and labeled the Trump assassination attempt as a \u201cmass shooting.\u201d \u201cMr. (Corey) Comperatore, President Trump and the other rally attendees wounded in Butler are now members of a club no one wants to belong to \u2014 the thousands of people who have fallen victim to mass shootings,\u201d Raskin said, as an aide held up a poster listing some of the recent mass shootings in the US. Some Democrats on the committee pointed out that Crooks used an AR-15-style weapon, which many Democrats have been trying to ban or at least restrict for people under 21, like Crooks. Rep. Gerry Connolly\u00a0asked\u00a0whether Americans having more guns makes Cheatle\u2019s job \u201ceasier or harder.\u201d \u201cThe job of the Secret Service is difficult every day,\u201d Cheatle said, before Connolly cut her off, decried the proliferation of assault-style rifles, and chided the Secret Service director for \u201cevading\u201d the gun issue. Cheatle defends staff after smears target female agents Cheatle indirectly\u00a0responded to allegations\u00a0circling around right-wing media outlets and lawmakers that female agents were in part to blame for security failures at the Trump rally. Female agents who were part of Trump\u2019s Secret Service detail were photographed shielding the former president after the failed assassination attempt.\u00a0Some on the right\u00a0have claimed that the women couldn\u2019t properly protect Trump. (The Trump family has pushed back directly on that claim.) Asked by a Republican member about her efforts to \u201cchange the makeup of the Secret Service\u201d because there was \u201ctoo high a percentage are men,\u201d Cheatle said she hires only \u201cthe best and brightest.\u201d \u201cI am hiring the best qualified candidates that put in an application that want to work for our great organization,\u201d she responded.

{"id": "2024_07_22_politics_democratic-voters-kamala-harris-excitement", "text": "Live to 94 like Pat Levin, and you think maybe you have seen it all. Well, think again. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thrown into an emotional tailspin,\u201d is how Levin described President Joe Biden\u2019s abrupt departure from the 2024 campaign this weekend and his quick endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cWhat next? An\u00a0enormous feeling of relief along with an enormous feeling of anxiety.\u201d Oh, plus this: \u201cYes, I support Harris.\u201d That was the consensus among Democrats in our All Over the Map project, which is tracking the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of key voters. We heard relief that the president stepped away from a campaign that was on a path to likely defeat, worry that there is not enough time to turn things around, and support for Harris to take the baton. \u201cI\u2019ve always said it needs to be Vice President Harris,\u201d said Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee\u2019s Black neighborhoods. \u201cShe\u2019s the first Black woman VP and I think it would be seen as a sign of disrespect to have someone seemingly jump ahead of her.\u201d Michigan auto worker Tonya Rincon described herself as \u201ckind of stunned\u201d by Biden\u2019s decision but said Democrats have no time to waste. \u201cVice President Harris is the obvious choice,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cShe\u2019s experienced. Qualified. An extremely strong candidate and we need to get behind her immediately.\u201d There was overwhelming support for the California Democrat, but not unanimity. On the plus side for Harris: Democratic voters think she can rebuild lagging Biden support in the Black community and among younger voters, and they see her as a more vibrant and aggressive campaigner on abortion rights and other issues viewed as critical motivators for Democratic voters. But the doubts some voters raised about Harris underscore the challenges ahead, assuming she emerges as the Democratic nominee. They range from concerns the process will become too messy to worries that she is not the strongest candidate to contest critical battleground states. \u201cIf it\u2019s Kamala, her choice of a VP must be the absolute best,\u201d said Darrell Ann Murphy, a retiree in Pennsylvania\u2019s bellwether Northampton County. \u201cI wonder if the country is ready for a Black woman president,\u201d said Walter Robinson Jr., an African American union auto worker.\u00a0\u201cShe wasn\u2019t seen so much during her term (as vice president), so I\u2019m still processing the whole thing.\u201d Likewise, Carey Fulks, an African American from Atlanta, said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe Harris is a strong enough candidate to take the presidency this close to the election. \u2026 Democrats might rally around Harris, but I don\u2019t know about undecided voters.\u201d Some uncommitted voters not happy with \u2018absentee VP\u2019 A Harris campaign would face the same daunting challenge that factored into Biden\u2019s exit from the race: Former President Donald Trump is ahead in major battleground states, at least in polling taken before Biden bowed out. Any Democratic path to victory runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and leading Democrats in those states say the vice president has a lot to prove. Our project includes voters in 10 states, and several who are undecided or at least not firmly committed to a candidate were quick to take issue with Harris as Biden\u2019s replacement. Allen Naparalla, who runs a winery in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, said Biden waited too long. \u201cHe was just too old to be president anymore,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kamala Harris has it in her to be a competent president.\u201d Antonio Munoz, who owns a restaurant and catering business in Las Vegas, texted two words when asked about the change: \u201cMichelle Obama.\u201d Ray Flores, who owns a handful of restaurants in Tucson, Arizona, was also nonplussed by the Democrats\u2019 changing of the guard. \u201cOur country is lost,\u201d said Flores, who is deeply disillusioned with both major political parties. \u201cWe have serious issues, but issues aren\u2019t being considered, just the pocketbooks of the very rich and famous.\u201d Kim Cavaliere, a Georgia independent who backed Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, said she was happy Biden made the decision to step aside. \u201cHowever, I am not pleased with Harris running,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is this absentee VP?\u201d And Linda Rooney \u2013 a Republican from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, who backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary \u2013 likewise does not have a good impression of Harris. \u201cI think, personally, she has done a horrible job as VP,\u201d Rooney said. She is no fan of Trump and said she might vote Democratic if her governor, Josh Shapiro, emerged as the Biden replacement. \u201cIf Shapiro was the Dems\u2019 pick, I\u2019d be in a quandary about who to pick in November,\u201d Rooney said. Shapiro, however, was quick to endorse Harris. The swing state governor is on the list of possible Harris running mates. So is Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, whose name as a possible Harris vice presidential pick also came up as our voters shared their initial reaction to Biden\u2019s decision. \u201cHaving Mark Kelly at that level would be immensely beneficial for Arizona, as he would fight to protect our reproductive rights, veteran rights, and advocate against the deportation of veterans,\u201d said Melissa Cordero, an Air Force veteran who now works for a conservation group in Tucson. \u201cLet\u2019s continue to push for a ticket that prioritizes these crucial issues.\u201d Kelly, a veteran and former astronaut, was a first choice of Nanette Mees, a registered Republican in the northern Virginia suburbs who tends to vote Democratic for president because of abortion rights and, more recently, issues she has with Trump\u2019s character. \u201cOh boy, what a sad state our country is in,\u201d Mees said Sunday. \u201cMark Kelly would be good, but I think it\u2019s extremely sad that Trump is probably going to win.\u201d Like Mees, Las Vegas real estate agent Zoila Sanchez is a longtime Republican but not a Trump fan. \u201cThere are no other Democrats I see as presidential,\u201d Sanchez said after Biden withdrew. \u201cI know it is going to be Kamala Harris. I hope they pick a Hispanic woman to be her running mate.\u201d Some of the reaction included unconventional suggestions, perhaps to be expected after such a tumultuous stretch in the campaign. Longtime Black activist and organizer in Milwaukee Davette Baker said, \u201cYes, we could make history\u201d if Harris won the presidency. But she said she was worried about whether Harris can win. Baker mentioned Arizona\u2019s Kelly as an option, and then added this: \u201cIf we did want to try a woman, we could get Liz Cheney.\u201d\u00a0The former Wyoming congresswoman, a conservative who lost a primary to a Trump-backed challenger, is one of the former president\u2019s fiercest critics. Optimism about the Harris-Trump contrast While acknowledging significant challenges, many of the Democratic voters in our group were energized by the weekend drama, believing that Biden had virtually no chance of winning and that a new ticket at least might. \u201cIt was for the best,\u201d said Eric Jones, an African American entrepreneur in Milwaukee. \u201cNow, the Dems have a chance.\u201d Summer Matkin, a college student in Detroit who was undecided because she opposes Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, described Harris as \u201ca strong pick\u201d to lead the Democratic ticket. And Jade Gray, a recent University of Michigan graduate who was co-president of the campus College Democrats, said her phone was busy Sunday with excited texts from friends. \u201cSpecifically, about the felon vs. prosecutor angle that a Trump vs. Harris race would have,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI know I\u2019d like to see them in a debate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/democratic-voters-kamala-harris-excitement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "politics"}}
