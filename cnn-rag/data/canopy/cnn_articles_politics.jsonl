The searing picture of a nation in dystopian decline that defines the ex-president\u2019s politics was largely missing on the first night of the Republican National Convention. In its place was a sense of the divine \u2014 a pulsating belief in miracles among thousands of Republican delegates and a feeling that God spared their hero after he was nearly killed in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Thousands of Trump supporters in Milwaukee on Monday night hailed their leader, elevating him from MAGA superhero to saint-like status. Trump, a white bandage over his wounded right ear, stood below the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks NBA arena, like a heavyweight boxer waiting to climb into the ring in a title fight. The crowd cheered as his face suddenly appeared on a giant screen. Then he walked deliberately into the spotlight \u2014 raising his fist, in an electric political moment before slowly ascending to the VIP box to greet his new vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Trump didn\u2019t speak to the crowd, but mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d over and over again. Usually, Trump\u2019s face projects anger or rage or sarcasm. But on Monday night, it wore unusual emotion. It looked as if tears welled in Trump\u2019s eyes. A man who normally projects strength and seeks to dominant every room he enters betrayed a trace of wistfulness and vulnerability, as might befit someone coming to terms with their life being saved by a stroke of luck and a turn of the head. \u2018The devil \u2026 holding a rifle\u2019 Trump\u2019s supporters have long seen him as a God-like figure and his own campaign has played into the trope with advertising. He\u2019s styled himself as the secular prophet who leads a populist movement. For Trump\u2019s millions of American fans, Monday night was a validation of their faith in God and the ex-president and the righteousness of his mission. \u201cOn Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back on his feet and he roared!\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who reached for a preacher\u2019s cadence and was among many speakers who argued that Providence had saved Trump so he could save America. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem also sanctified the ex-president following his brush with death. \u201cWe already knew that President Donald Trump is fighter. He is the toughest man that I have ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody has endured more than what he has gone through. They\u2019ve attacked his reputation, they impeached him, they tried to bankrupt him, and they unjustly prosecuted him. But even in the most perilous moment this week, his instinct was to stand and to fight.\u201d Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 one of the rare speakers who broke from the unity message \u2013 said,\u00a0\u201cI thank God that his hand was on President Trump.\u201d The ex-president\u2019s escape spared the country another of the unfathomable political tragedies that have scared its history. Two pictures of Trump But where some voters see Trump as a messiah-like figure, others see a cult. Where some see inspiration, others sense demagoguery. And the veneration of Trump as a sort-of quasi-religious figure will cause deep fear given that he has made no secret of his authoritarian streak and a desire for retribution against his enemies if he wins a second term. That threat has taken on new relevance in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling that expanded presidential immunity. This unbridgeable national estrangement over the 45th president encapsulates the political divide that is deepening in America, which means calls for unity and a cooling of political rhetoric, while welcome, are unlikely to be sustained in the long term. After all, Trump\u2019s triumphant appearance on the day the Republican convention made him its nominee marked the official embrace of a figure who tried to destroy American democracy to stay in office after losing the 2020 election. This was the same man who summoned a mob to Washington on January 6, 2021, and told supporters to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d before they invaded the US Capitol, beat up police and tried to thwart the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. These jarring and dueling perspectives toward Trump are one reason why it will be hard for many Americans to buy into Trump\u2019s assurance about he\u2019d now try to heal a polarized nation. The former president insisted in an interview with the Washington Examiner on Sunday that his perspective had changed after he survived the shooting, implying that he\u2019d desist from using a political technique that relies on tearing at societal, cultural and racial divides. \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together.\u201d Multiple times during his administration,\u00a0pundits declared at a moment of national emergency that Trump had changed and \u201cpivoted\u201d to being presidential. But the ex-president did as much as anyone to foment the toxic political culture that is more intense now than at any time since the 1960s and which many political leaders blame for Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt and other political violence. Until he proves otherwise, voters might give the ex-president a hearing for any tempered tone given the horror of what unfolded in Pennsylvania, when Trump survived but a rally goer \u2014 father, fisherman and fireman Corey Comperatore \u2014 was killed while shielding his family. Old habits die hard Almost every Republican speaker got the memo Monday \u2014 that instead of Trump\u2019s normal characterization of a nation under siege from rampant crime, invading migrants and far left ideology, the prime-time picture was one of unity and inclusion. A list of Black Republican and female Republican lawmakers gave speeches, offering a somewhat misleading perception that the GOP has a deep and diverse bench. One GOP source said speechwriters at the convention had thrown out all their pre-written material for the week\u2019s top speakers and started again. Only Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson struck a discordant note as his old speech was loaded into the teleprompter and he went on a tear about how \u201ctoday\u2019s Democrat agenda, their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, to our values and our people.\u201d But there were earlier signs that the new sunny face of Trump\u2019s post-assassination GOP went only so far. The president\u2019s selection of Vance elevated one of the most fervent proponents of MAGA rhetoric. The Ohio senator responded in the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s shooting with one of the most discordant statements at a time when politicians on all sides were trying to calm a traumatized nation. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance wrote on X. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d The assassination attempt aside, Trump came into the convention on a roll, leading in most of the polls, well positioned in battleground state and profiting from the aftermath of Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance last month. He got another monumental win on Monday when Florida Judge Aileen Cannon threw out special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s classified documents case in a move that cemented the emerging reality that the ex-president may never be held accountable for his multiple alleged transgressions against the rule of law, apart from in his conviction in his hush money trial in New York. The reaction of Trump and his allies was just as misleading, angry and injurious to vital democratic institutions of accountability as it has always been. \u201cAs we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts \u2014 The January 6th Hoax in Washington, D.C., \u2026\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cThe Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, ME.\u201d New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of Trump\u2019s top supporters on Capitol Hill, accused the Justice Department of trying to \u201cshred the Constitution.\u201d The rhetoric was a sign from some corners of the GOP that national unity is possible only if Trump is handed the right to rule in an unfettered manner shielded from any criminal consequences for his actions. So, while Trump is promising change and a new tone, some old habits die hard. The ex-president has a new chance at politics and life in the wake of his assassination attempt. This week will begin to show how he uses it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/trump-return-rnc-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_trump-biden-analysis-2024", "text": "Donald Trump will pull off his greatest feat yet as Joe Biden confronts his darkest hour. The ex-president, 78, will accept the Republican nomination Thursday, advancing one of the most stunning comebacks in political history after his bid to steal the 2020 election, an unprecedented\u00a0criminal conviction and an assassination attempt. Biden, 81, is meanwhile being rocked by a Democratic rebellion. Concerns about whether he can again defeat his 2020 opponent have boiled back up amid lawmakers\u2019 concerns about his health and cognitive state and despair over his chances of blocking the extreme possibilities of a second Trump term. Sources told CNN Wednesday that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told the president that polls show he can\u2019t beat Trump and could crush Democratic hopes of winning the House if he stays in the race. A White House race that slumbered for months has suddenly erupted over a momentous three weeks bookended by Biden\u2019s cataclysmic debate performance and the attempted assassination of Trump \u2013 a whiplash of events unseen in half a century. The 45th president\u2019s comeback will only be fully realized if he becomes the second one-term president to win a return to the White House in November. But his rebound to this point may be even more unlikely than his unexpected win in the 2016 election. His return to the top of the GOP ticket means it is now clear that Trump was not simply an aberration, but is becoming a historic political force who has utterly transformed his party and could do the same for the nation, for better or worse, if he comes back to White House on January 20, 2025. Events play into Trump\u2019s election strategy In a race Trump has cast as a contrast between strength and weakness, the optics are better than the Republican can have dared hope less than four months before Election Day. Republicans are lionizing a nominee who escaped a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet and rose, bloodied, to raise his fist with a vow to \u201cfight.\u201d Biden, by comparison, retreated from the campaign trail Wednesday to his Delaware home with a case of Covid-19. Trump just choreographed one of the most remarkable shows of dominance in any political party of the modern age, requiring his vanquished primary foes to pledge fealty in front of a primetime television audience at the convention on Tuesday. Biden is, meanwhile, losing control of his party, clashing heatedly with lawmakers who warn he\u2019ll cost them the White House, Senate and the House and as party grandees \u2014 like California Rep. Adam Schiff \u2014 publicly say he should step aside. The electoral map reflects the diverging fortunes of the two candidates. Trump leads most national polls and has the advantage in battleground states. And while the situation is not yet unrecoverable for Biden, most analysts believe he has a limited path to 270 electoral votes through Blue Wall states Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. His campaign insists it\u2019s not given up elsewhere. Presidential elections are won by votes of millions of Americans in the fall \u2013 not snapshots of the relative fortunes of campaigns in July. And Trump\u2019s apparent momentum may have been inflated by a convention that is showcasing a party he has stripped of all dissenting voices in an eight-year political purge. The ex-president remains deeply unpopular nationally\u00a0and millions of Americans disdain his personality cult, record of racially inflammatory rhetoric and his authoritarian instincts. But that\u2019s one reason why his campaign is pulling its punches on Biden in the hope he stays in the race. The growing threat to Biden\u2019s campaign is not being driven by pundits; it\u2019s coming from deep inside his party by lawmakers and donors who fear a GOP landslide in November. As the Democratic Party threatens to tear itself apart, the Trump GOP has shown rare discipline and unity \u2014 underpinned by a growing belief by delegates here in Milwaukee that the former president is headed back to the White House. After Trump escaped the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, his campaign has leveraged the aftermath to reshape his image. It has also portrayed his four years in power as an idyll of peace and prosperity. His team is seeking to dispel memories of the chaos, acrimony and assaults on constitutional order that characterized his presidency, which culminated in his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power and the mob riot by his supporters at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, that led to his second impeachment. The GOP is painting a picture of a nation that is broke, beset by crime and an invasion by undocumented migrants, and economic blight disrespected in the world. The picture is highly subjective. Americans are still suffering from high prices, but inflation isn\u2019t as high as it was, crime figures are coming down and unemployment has been near historic lows. The economy is outpacing other developed countries and Trump thwarted a bid to ease the immigration crisis by torpedoing a bipartisan bill that could have addressed the border. And in perhaps the most daring bait-and-switch, the party led by a man who constantly genuflected to President Vladimir Putin is accusing Biden \u2013 who reinvigorated NATO and confronted the Kremlin\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine \u2013 as weak on Russia. The image making was taken to new levels by Trump\u2019s new vice presidential nominee, JD Vance, in his address to the GOP convention Wednesday evening. The Ohio Republican senator wove a parable of national redemption from the horrific scenes in Pennsylvania when Trump fell to the ground but reemerged wounded but unbowed. \u201cGo and watch the video of a would-be assassin coming a quarter of an inch from taking his life,\u201d Vance told a spellbound crowd of delegates. \u201cConsider the lies they told you about Donald Trump. And then look at the photo of him defiant \u2013 fist in the air. When Donald J. Trump rose to his feet in that Pennsylvania field, all of America stood up with him.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump represents America\u2019s last best hope to restore what \u2013 if lost \u2013 may never be found again.\u201d Biden\u2019s hold on the Democratic nomination appears to weaken As Trump settled in to enjoy the national debut of his new protege, the revolt aimed at pushing Biden out of the race burst back into the open, despite the spotlight shined on the Republican convention in Milwaukee. Schiff became the most high-profile Democrat to publicly calling for the president to \u201cpass the torch.\u201d The California Democrat said in a statement that, by leaving, Biden could \u201csecure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.\u201d The intervention was seen as especially significant since Schiff, who is running for the Senate, is very\u00a0close to Pelosi, the ultimate Democratic powerbroker who many in her party hope will be able to finesse a transition to another presidential candidate. But Biden pushed back in his call with Pelosi, telling her that he has seen polling that indicates that he can still win, CNN reported Wednesday. Signs of dissent toward Biden grew as details emerged of an ill-tempered clash with lawmakers over the weekend. Two sources described the remarkable encounter to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that included an exchange with Rep. Jason Crow, an Iraq war veteran who told the president that voters are not seeing the election the way the president is. At one point, Biden told the Colorado Democrat, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that crap,\u201d and said that while he knows Crow is a Bronze Star recipient, like his son Beau, \u201che didn\u2019t rebuild NATO.\u201d Another Democratic lawmaker, Pennsylvania Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, told Biden that he was losing ground in her state. The president told Houlahan that his team would get her talking points about all of the things that he has done for Pennsylvania and reminded her that he married a \u201cPhilly girl.\u201d By evening, there were fresh signs that Biden\u2019s reelection effort was again plunging into critical territory. ABC News reported that in a meeting at Biden\u2019s beach house on Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer shared the concerns of his caucus about Biden\u2019s campaign. The leader\u2019s spokesman said in a statement that the report was \u201cidle speculation.\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also had a meeting with Biden last week.\u00a0The leader\u2019s spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cOn behalf of the House Democratic caucus, he directly expressed the full breadth of insight, perspective and conclusions reached about the path forward - after extensive colleague to colleague discussions. Any further characterization of the private, one-on-one meeting between President Biden and Leader Jeffries is speculative and uninformed.\u201d Biden has publicly shut down every suggestion that he should step aside, despite overwhelming public concerns that he would not be able to fully serve out a second term that would end when he is 86. He insists he is the strongest candidate to take on Trump in November. But doubts that he is getting a full picture of his vulnerable political standing grew Wednesday with the release of an AP-NORC poll showing that a 65% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say Biden \u201cshould withdraw and allow his party to select a different candidate.\u201d As the bad news rolled in for the president, one senior Democratic advisor told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that Biden was being more \u201creceptive\u201d in private and not as defiant as he was in public as discussions with Capitol Hill Democrats continue. \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win?\u2019\u201d the adviser said, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019s going to land but seems to be listening,\u201d the source said. The latest speculation over Biden\u2019s future represents a cruel twist for a president who spent a lifetime pursuing the highest office, who defied expectations by reviving a moribund primary campaign to triumph over Trump in 2020 and who has endured a lifetime of personal tragedy. But the erosion in the president\u2019s position over the last 21 days was precipitated by his disastrous showing in a debate in which he appeared frail and sometimes confused in a way that validated the concerns of many voters. The situation is especially agonizing for the president, since he views his campaign in existential terms and as a battle to save the soul of America from what he sees as Trump\u2019s mortal threat to democracy. The ex-president spent four years testing the rule of law and the limits of executive power in office and is vowing to pursue a campaign of personal retribution if he is reelected. And the fact that the Republican Party is crowning a convicted felon, who was found guilty in his New York hush money case, who lost a massive civil fraud trial and was found liable for sexual assault, has been all but lost in the rush of attention Trump has achieved after the heinous attempt on his life on Saturday.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_democratic-defections-joe-biden", "text": "President Joe Biden faced a new round of defections Friday from Democratic lawmakers publicly calling on him to leave the presidential race, even as his campaign sought to project a message that he isn\u2019t going anywhere. One day after the Republican National Convention, new public calls for Biden to drop out from a dozen lawmakers \u2013 including Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a close ally to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 grew the list of congressional Democrats to more than 30. Two House Democrats close to Pelosi, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity and rawness in the party right now, attributed Friday\u2019s new statements \u2013 especially Lofgren\u2019s letter to Biden \u2013 to the former speaker and her belief that it is critical for the president and his allies to understand the effort to push him aside is not going away after the Republican convention, despite the campaign\u2019s efforts to quash it. The president is described by a source with direct knowledge as \u201cseething\u201d at Pelosi. This source said the sentiment only grew Friday when Lofgren, Pelosi\u2019s longtime close lieutenant, released her letter urging Biden to step aside. CNN has reached out to Pelosi\u2019s camp and the Biden campaign for comment on this reporting. It is a remarkable break between two powerful party elders and longtime allies in enacting key elements of the Biden agenda. Aides to Vice President Kamala Harris inside and outside the campaign have also expressed unhappiness with Pelosi and her talk of a quick process to find a new candidate should Biden step aside. To them, \u201cprocess\u201d means trying to bypass the vice president in the event the president stepped aside.\u00a0Harris, who has staunchly defended Biden publicly and tried to show unity, spoke with donors on a call Friday afternoon, which she was asked to do by the West Wing, according to campaign officials. Biden\u2019s campaign hoped to force party unity Friday, releasing a statement from Biden saying he was looking forward to hitting the campaign trail next week after being sidelined with Covid-19. And Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Friday morning to say Biden was \u201cabsolutely\u201d in the race. \u201cAbsolutely the president\u2019s in this race. You heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe\u00a0Biden\u00a0is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.\u201d Instead, there was a stream of new statements from House Democrats. The dynamic has played out repeatedly this week, as more and more Democrats have made public their desire for Biden to leave the race \u2013 in addition to reports of congressional Democratic leaders pushing Biden about his chances \u2013 even as the president repeatedly says he has no intention to drop out. A Democratic lawmaker\u00a0told CNN that House\u00a0Democratic Leader\u00a0Hakeem Jeffries and his team are not discouraging members from continuing to speak out against Biden\u2019s candidacy. The source said it was their impression that\u00a0members were privately being encouraged to make such statements if they felt that way. For some of those who want Biden to step down, this source said that there is a fear that the public pile-on, which is expected to grow, is overkill and making Biden mad and potentially even more dug in. This source, who is in touch with the White House, said\u00a0that while Biden is now more open to the conversation about potentially stepping aside, he \u201ccould go either way\u201d and that the people he is listening to aren\u2019t talking publicly. That concern didn\u2019t stop more calls for Biden to leave the race on Friday. Lofgren, who served on the House January 6 committee, released a letter she sent to Biden urging him to step aside.\u00a0\u201cSimply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to\u00a0lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot,\u201d she wrote. Heinrich was the third senator to publicly call for Biden to leave the race, saying he believed it was \u201cin the best interests of our country\u201d for Biden to step aside. \u201cBy passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation\u2019s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\u201d\u00a0Heinrich said in a statement. Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat, told Dana Bash on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d Friday that it was time for Biden to drop out. \u201cPassing the torch is the right thing to do,\u201d Landsman said. \u201cThat is the way to ensure that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t win the presidency.\u201d And four other House Democrats \u2013 Reps. Jared Huffman and Mark Pocan; a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Chuy Garcia; and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Marc Veasey \u2013 released a joint statement Friday, using the same \u201cpass the torch\u201d rhetoric. \u201cPassing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,\u201d they said. \u201cIt would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.\u201d Lawmakers urging Biden to stay in the race have warned about the unchartered waters that the party would enter if Biden were to drop out.\u00a0Biden\u2019s campaign released a new memo Friday saying that there \u201cis no plan for an alternative nominee.\u201d DNC officials met by phone Friday for a convention rules committee meeting, where they\u00a0shared few details on when a virtual roll call to renominate Biden. During the meeting, party leaders reiterated that voting wouldn\u2019t start before August 1, but didn\u2019t set a specific date. Instead, under the proposed plan, it will be up to party leadership to pick a date at a later time. The rules committee didn\u2019t take any steps to approve the plan Friday but will meet again next week.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich", "text": "Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia, told CNN he has \u201csympathy and empathy\u201d for Evan Gershkovich following the conviction and sentencing of the Wall Street Journal reporter, but expressed hope that the development could open the door for a deal to secure both of their release. Whelan, who called CNN from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Friday, said he was able to watch a news broadcast about the sentencing. \u201cThe only thing I could think about was, when I was standing in court, listening to the judge read the false tale of my conviction and hearing that I would have to serve 16 years in prison. And there\u2019s surreal experience of knowing that you were 100% innocent, and that\u00a0this, this, stage show, this drama was going on around you,\u201d he described. Whelan was arrested in December 2018 and, like Gershkovich, was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage charges that he and the US government vehemently deny. Whelan has also been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic and empathetic to him and his family because I understand what they\u2019re going through and my family certainly understands what they\u2019re going through,\u201d the ex-Marine continued. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you just can\u2019t fathom, especially if you\u2019re a tourist or like Evan, he was just doing his job, and you end up in a cage, in a courtroom, being told that you have to spend 16 years of hard labor.\u201d However, Whelan expressed hope that the speed with which the Russian government carried out the trial, which was decried as a sham, and sentencing could signal that Moscow is open to moving forward on negotiations to bring them both home. In the cases of Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner, the Russian government has insisted on having a conviction before the negotiations on the swaps that secured their release moved forward. \u201cWe think that could be a good sign that the Russians want to actually now start negotiations with the US for his release as well as mine,\u201d he said. Whelan said he would advise Gershkovich to \u201ckeep a stiff upper lip, keep his chin up.\u201d Whelan noted that he was moved to the remote prison colony \u201cwithout notice\u201d \u2013\u00a0\u201cit was a two o\u2019clock in the morning, they took me and put me on a train from Moscow to Mordovia\u201d \u2013 \u201cso he needs to be prepared for that sort of\u00a0thing.\u201d\u00a0He also advised the wrongfully detained journalist to \u201cmentally prepare himself to enter the Russian prison system.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very different, probably, than what he\u2019s used to in the pretrial center,\u201d he said. Whelan was positive about the US government efforts underway to secure their release. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier Friday that the US government is working \u201cquite literally every day\u201d to bring Gershkovich and Whelan home. \u201cWe\u2019re working it as we speak, and we\u2019re not going to stop until we get Evan home,\u00a0\u2018til\u00a0we\u00a0(get)Paul Whelan home,\u00a0\u2018til\u00a0we get others home,\u201d Blinken said at the Aspen Security Forum. Asked why the Russians would negotiate now when \u201cit\u2019s such a huge bargaining chip\u201d with the next administration, Blinken downplayed the impact of the election on the negotiations. \u201cLook, any effort to bring any American home is going to be part of a process of back-and-forth discussion, potentially negotiation. And, depending on what the other side is looking for, they\u2019ll reach their own conclusions about whether it meets whatever their needs are, and we can bring someone home. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s dependent on an election in the United States or anywhere else,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_housing-provider-migrant-children-sexual-abuse", "text": "Employees of the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children in the US repeatedly sexually abused and harassed children in their care for at least eight years, the Justice Department said Thursday, alleging a shocking litany of offenses that took place as the company amassed billions of dollars in government contracts. Southwest Key Programs Inc. employees, including supervisors, raped, touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning in 2015 and possibly earlier, the Justice Department said in a lawsuit filed this week. At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020. It was not immediately clear how many children are currently in Southwest Key\u2019s vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment beyond the lawsuit announcement when asked whether the department recommended that children be removed from the shelters or that the the nonprofit\u2019s contracts be terminated. \u201cIn some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIn harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children\u2019s vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\u201d In a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children. The nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the US Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters \u2013 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company\u2019s largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200. The provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government\u2019s response to the\u00a0arrival of hundreds of thousands\u00a0of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the\u00a0separation of thousands of families\u00a0in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023. The Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers. Health and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key\u2019s care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities have received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider\u2019s shelters since 2015. Among the lawsuit\u2019s allegations: An employee \u201crepeatedly sexually abused\u201d three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \u201crepeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their \u2018private area,\u2019 and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\u201d The lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider\u2019s shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020. Children were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \u201craises serious pattern or practice concerns\u201d about Southwest Key. \u201cHHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\u201d he said in a statement. Southwest Key Programs Inc. spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \u201cdoes not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\u201d Texas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void. The lawsuit comes less than three weeks after\u00a0a federal judge granted\u00a0the Justice Department\u2019s request to lift special court oversight of HHS\u2019 care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began. Special court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol. Leecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u201d and blamed Texas\u2019 revocation of licenses for \u201ca powder keg waiting to explode.\u201d \u201cWhile I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\u201d said Welch, deputy legal director of Children\u2019s Rights. Neha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \u201cprofoundly disturbing and shocking.\u201d \u201cI hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law. The Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "A growing collection of congressional Democrats are calling on Joe Biden to end his reelection bid, following the president\u2019s disastrous debate performance last month and his failure since to convince members of his own party that he can defeat former President Donald Trump in the fall. It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party\u2019s delegates means it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be forced out of the race against his will. That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination. Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats\u2019 convention will return to Chicago in August. As we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February,\u00a0if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates \u2013\u00a0almost all of them currently pledged to Biden \u2013 allocated as part of the primary process. These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could\u00a0decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president\u2019s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to head the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party\u2019s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats \u2013 The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans \u2013 If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party\u2019s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party\u2019s nominee. Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate\u2019s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.) The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?

{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_tennessee-anti-drag-law-challenge-dismissed", "text": "A federal appeals court on Thursday dismissed a challenge to a Tennessee law that restricts public drag show performances in the state. The appeals court ruled 2-1 that Friends of George\u2019s, a Memphis-based nonprofit that produces drag performances and comedy sketches, lacked the legal standing challenge the law, with the dissenting judge saying that he thought the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the measure, which he called an \u201cunconstitutional content-based restriction on speech.\u201d Passed in 2023, Tennessee\u2019s Adult Entertainment Act sought to limit\u00a0\u201cadult cabaret performances\u201d on public property to shield children from viewing them. Violators could be\u00a0charged\u00a0with a misdemeanor and repeat offenders with a felony. The Tennessee law was the first of its kind to be enacted in the US. State officials have argued that the measure is not a full ban and is only intended to stop overtly sexual performances in front of minors. In June 2023, a federal judge barred enforcement of the law in Shelby County, Tennessee,\u00a0which is home to Memphis,\u00a0saying the law was an \u201cunconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech.\u201d But the\u00a06th\u00a0US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision on Thursday and threw out the case in its entirety. The\u00a0appellate\u00a0court said Friends of George\u2019s failed to show how it would be harmed by the law. Circuit Judge John Nalbandian wrote\u00a0that the group\u00a0\u201cfaces no certainly impeding threat of prosecution.\u201d Nalbandian, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was joined by Circuit Judge Eugene Siler, an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Circuit Judge Andre Mathis, an appointee of President Joe Biden, said in\u00a0his\u00a0dissent that he would have upheld the lower-court\u2019s ruling\u00a0that blocked\u00a0enforcement of the law in Shelby County. Friends of George\u2019s \u201cdid not have to wait\u201d for state prosecutors to enforce the Adult Entertainment Act\u00a0\u201cbefore challenging the constitutionality of the law,\u201d Mathis wrote. \u201cGiven the nature of its shows, along with the general admissions policy followed by the Evergreen Theater, there is a substantial probability that\u00a0(Friends of George\u2019s)\u00a0will engage in conduct that is arguably affected by the (Adult Entertainment Act) because it performs adult cabaret entertainment in a location where it could be viewed by a minor. And if it does,\u00a0(Friends of George\u2019s)\u00a0faces a certain threat of prosecution,\u201d the judge wrote. Though the ban remains in effect in much of the state, officials are blocked from enforcing it in Blount County as part of a separate lawsuit against it. \u201cI feel quite confident that that case is going to survive standing review and we\u2019re still considering whether to appeal the standing decision here,\u201d said Brice Timmons, an attorney representing the plaintiffs in the Friends of George\u2019s lawsuit. Republicans say the performances \u2013 which often feature men dressing as women in exaggerated makeup while singing or entertaining a crowd, though some shows feature bawdier content \u2013 expose children to sexual themes and imagery that are inappropriate. LGBTQ advocates, however, argue that not all drag shows are sexual in nature and laws such as the one in Tennessee stigmatize the community and could violate the First Amendment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/tennessee-anti-drag-law-challenge-dismissed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_kamala-harris-jd-vance-race", "text": "Vice President Kamala\u00a0Harris\u00a0has spent\u00a0much\u00a0of the year traveling around the country, tackling the Republican party and its leader, former President Donald Trump.\u00a0But now she\u2019s throwing her political punches at another\u00a0opponent: Sen. JD Vance. Mounting concerns over President Joe Biden and his viability as a candidate have put an even brighter spotlight on\u00a0Harris\u00a0in recent weeks, as some allies and lawmakers float her name as a\u00a0possible\u00a0replacement to lead the party\u2019s ticket.\u00a0As panic and speculation spread across the Democratic Party following the June 27 debate, the vice president and her aides continued to keep an eye on who might\u00a0be selected to serve as Trump\u2019s vice president. In the weeks leading up to Trump unveiling his running mate in Milwaukee,\u00a0there were\u00a0several men widely believed to be on the former president\u2019s short list. They monitored with great interest each of their Sunday show appearances, public remarks and other media interviews, with the expectation that one of them would likely face off against\u00a0Harris\u00a0on the debate stage this summer. Harris\u2019 team agreed: Vance\u00a0would clearly be a tough debate opponent.\u00a0The Ohioan\u00a0appeared particularly skilled at deflecting questions about Trump\u2019s past statements and policy positions. That ability is likely to be one of several key factors that will shape\u00a0Harris\u2019\u00a0debate preparations. Democrats hope that\u00a0Harris \u2013 who debated Biden during the 2020 Democratic primary and landed some of the most memorable punches on the now-president \u2013 will far outperform Vance. Biden\u2019s disastrous showing against Trump last month has set off panic across the Democratic Party, and the president\u2019s allies are scrambling to try to turn the page on the saga. Biden\u2019s halting debate showing stunned even some of his own top aides, and the president botching an opportunity to lay out a clear argument against Trump on the issue of reproductive rights was among the most puzzling and frustrating for Democrats tuning in. \u201cShe will keep him and Trump on defense on abortion in a way that ideally Biden would\u2019ve done in the debate,\u201d one longtime\u00a0Harris\u00a0friend said. Aides to\u00a0Harris\u00a0say that when it comes to two issues in particular \u2013 reproductive rights and Trump\u2019s threat to democracy \u2013 Vance\u2019s own record and past statements should only strengthen what they already see as the vice president\u2019s most compelling arguments against the former president. In preparing for Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick,\u00a0Harris\u00a0aides saw an opportunity in Vance, given his support of a federal ban on abortion.\u00a0Harris has already been crisscrossing the country, attacking restrictions on abortions, and casting them as\u00a0\u201cTrump abortion bans.\u201d When asked if that would factor into how\u00a0Harris\u00a0makes her case against the Trump-Vance ticket, one source said: \u201cOf course it will be. His record speaks for itself,\u201d referring to Vance. But, sources say, that\u00a0Harris\u2019 main target on the trail will continue to be Trump, while Vance serves\u00a0as an example of what the former president wants to achieve in a second term. \u201cOn the campaign trail, she\u2019ll keep the focus on Trump and talk about Vance as how it reflects on Trump,\u201d a campaign source told CNN. \u201cThis is telling about Trump\u2019s true position on an abortion ban. You can expect her to make that case,\u201d the source added, referring to Trump\u2019s waffling on an abortion ban. Harris\u00a0previewed that message\u00a0during a campaign stop in North Carolina on Thursday. The vice president argued that Trump\u2019s VP pick is a distraction from his extreme agenda that Americans \u201care not falling for.\u201d \u201cWith the selection of his running mate this week, Donald Trump is also trying to distract people. He wants to direct attention away from his record and his project 2025 plan to suggest that he and his running mate are going to prioritize the middle class,\u201d\u00a0Harris\u00a0said. In a brief call Tuesday,\u00a0Harris\u00a0and Vance said they looked forward to debating\u00a0one another\u00a0but didn\u2019t discuss specifics\u00a0about when that would happen, according to two sources familiar with the call.\u00a0The Trump campaign has declined to commit to a date, as they point to the chaos unfolding in the other political party. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can\u2019t lock in a date before their convention. To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala\u00a0Harris\u00a0picks as her running mate,\u201d Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN. The Biden campaign hit back Wednesday, saying:\u00a0\u201cThis debate has been discussed for two months now.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_trump-rally-shooter-searches", "text": "The Trump rally shooter searched online for information on the arrest of a Michigan mass shooter and his parents, who were prosecuted in a 2021 high school shooting. He visited websites for how to build explosives. And in the minutes before he fired shots in an attempted assassination of Donald Trump, he screenshotted a picture from a livestream of the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. A week before the shooting, Thomas Matthew Crooks searched online for the date of the Democratic National Convention and where Trump planned to speak, as well as other searches for Trump and President Joe Biden. These details were among those shared by FBI and US Secret Service officials in a Wednesday briefing with lawmakers and by additional people familiar with the investigation. The previously unreported\u00a0readout documents the scope of the investigation, including an expanded timeline of the would-be assassin\u2019s actions leading to up his assault and law enforcement\u2019s failure to prevent it. Investigators remain puzzled about possible motives for Saturday\u2019s attempted assassination of the former president, finding little to point to political or ideological intentions for the attack. But the would-be assassin\u2019s recent trail on the internet has provided investigators with a detailed picture of his possible mindset before the attack. FBI behavioral experts are building a profile of Crooks based on the findings, the FBI told lawmakers. One emerging theory by investigators, based in part on the timing and subjects of his online searches, is that the shooter was looking to carry out a mass shooting and that the Trump event\u2019s proximity and timing offered the most ready opportunity, according to a US official briefed on the matter. Unlike other mass shooters who often leave behind manifestos or writings to explain their attack, Crooks left behind few clues, in his bedroom or online. Investigators recovered rudimentary explosive devices from his car, along with a bullet-proof vest, additional magazines of the type he used in the attack and a drone, according to the officials who briefed lawmakers Wednesday. At the family home, they also recovered 14 firearms and additional explosives, along with a second cellphone, a laptop and hard drive. Investigators have focused on Crooks\u2019 online activity in the months and days before the attack. Family members and people he worked with described him as quiet and a loner but haven\u2019t indicated that he showed any signs of planning an attack. In April, he searched websites for information on major depressive disorder and depressive crisis treatment. On his primary cellphone, investigators found an image of the arrest photo of Ethan Crumbley \u2013 the student who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021 \u2013 along with information about Crumbley and his parents, who were both found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the first time parents of a school shooter have been prosecuted. Three days after the Trump campaign announced the rally in Butler, a western Pennsylvania town about an hour from Crook\u2019s home, Crooks made numerous searches online for well-known political figures and political events. He searched for the date and location of the Democratic National Convention, which takes place in August in Chicago, and for the location of  the Trump rally. He also searched for information on Trump, Biden and other major political figures. On the day of the rally, Crooks made several internet searches, including for photos of the location of Trump\u2019s speech and for a local gun store not far from his home, where he purchased bullets that day. Investigators have found data showing that Crooks had visited the location of the rally a week before it was to be held. And on the morning of the rally, he visited the farm where the rally was to be held for over an hour. He then went home, and investigators believe he retrieved an AR-15 rifle owned by his father. Crooks\u2019 father told investigators that he saw his son leave the home with the rifle and believed he was going to a shooting range that the two had frequented. On the day of the rally, his parents attempted to reach out to Crooks to find him. He didn\u2019t respond.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/trump-rally-shooter-searches/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The security around Trump\u2019s future rallies and events is being entirely rethought, including where they should be held \u2013 whether indoors or in more secure outdoor locations. Outdoor events for Trump like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated, will likely be severely limited, sources said, if not entirely done away with. The ramp up in security reflects several new assessments by law enforcement since Saturday\u2019s shooting, officials familiar with the assessments told CNN, including concern about a possible copycat incident and others who may be inspired to carry out another attack after seeing the previous one narrowly fail. Multiple people familiar with the planning for this weekend\u2019s rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at an indoor arena said that both Secret Service and local law enforcement have recently increased the number of officers who will work on securing the event. During a board of commissioners meeting on Thursday, Kent County, Michigan, Undersheriff Bryan Muir said the sheriff\u2019s\u00a0office\u00a0was given a \u201clast-minute request\u201d from the Secret Service for 50 to 60 officers from the department to help with security for the rally. \u201cWe assist the Secret Service,\u201d a spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN, adding that the Secret Service was leading all security planning for the rally. \u201cWe just provide assistance.\u201d The security apparatus around Trump has entirely changed in recent days, people familiar with the matter have told CNN, including through local law enforcement. An example of this increased security occurred late Thursday night and into Friday morning, when a New Jersey law enforcement helicopter circled the Newark airport dozens of times until Trump\u2019s plane arrived and he was secured in his motorcade following his speech at the Republican National Convention. Security around Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence has also changed in recent days, with new road closures announced by the Palm Beach Police Department on Thursday which will last through the 2024 election. \u201cDue to enhanced security measures involving Mar a Lago and U.S. Secret Service-protected persons, South Ocean Boulevard will be closed to through traffic,\u201d the department said, adding that the closure around Mar-a-Lago would be \u201cin effect 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, until the November general election at a minimum.\u201d One source familiar with the security planning said the shooting will prompt numerous exercises between local and federal law enforcement agencies on how to handle large events, exercises that have been reduced since the Covid-19 pandemic. The source said the lack of these exercises have resulted in security gaps, including communication breakdowns between law enforcement partners. The source added that after-action reports, like those coming from last Saturday\u2019s shooting, immediately change the way security is handled at similar future events, including how exits and entrances are protected, widening the buffer zone, and other public safety measures. Saturday\u2019s rally in Grand Rapids will be the first official campaign rally with both Trump and Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance. Asked if Michigan State Police would be involved in security for Saturday\u2019s rally, director of communications Shanon Banner told CNN the department doesn\u2019t discuss security procedures. \u201cThe Secret Service is responsible for the security planning for presidential visits, but we stand ready to assist them with whatever they need,\u201d Banner wrote in an email.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_student-loan-save-plan-payments-paused", "text": "The Department of Education will pause student loan payments for 8 million borrowers after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked a repayment plan that the Biden administration launched last year. The fate of the plan, known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), is in flux as courts across the country consider two legal challenges brought by several Republican-led states. \u201cBorrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance while our administration continues to vigorously defend the SAVE Plan in court,\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement. Payments are not required during a forbearance, but a borrower is not making any progress toward paying down their debt. \u201cThe department will be providing regular updates to borrowers affected by these rulings in the coming days,\u201d Cardona said. Reducing student loan debt has been a priority for the Biden administration and the SAVE plan is one of the most significant policy changes it has made. Like other existing student loan repayment plans, SAVE ties a borrower\u2019s monthly payments to their income and family size. But SAVE is the most generous plan for low-income borrowers, offering lower payments and a faster path to student loan forgiveness. More than half of the 8 million people currently enrolled in SAVE have $0 monthly payments. The SAVE plan opened last year, after the Supreme Court struck down Biden\u2019s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program before it took effect. Legal challenges to SAVE Two groups of GOP-led states filed lawsuits earlier this year, arguing that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to implement SAVE. The government\u2019s lawyers say they are relying on power provided by Congress to the executive branch by a law called the Higher Education Act. On Thursday, the\u00a08th US Circuit Court of Appeals halted SAVE in a one-sentence, unsigned order. The court said the new freeze would remain in effect until it decides whether to issue a longer-term block. Meanwhile, in a separate case,\u00a0Alaska, South Carolina and Texas have asked the Supreme Court to review the SAVE plan. Much of the SAVE plan was implemented last year. But further reductions to borrowers\u2019 payments were scheduled to take effect in July. The Biden administration said that some, but not all, of those reductions were made to date. Now, all borrowers will be put in a forbearance. Lawyers for the Biden administration told the high court on Wednesday that it should let the program move forward while the legal matters play out. They argue that \u201cborrowers would stand to suffer significant and irreparable harm\u201d and many would \u201cexperience intense confusion\u201d about the status of their loans if the court blocked the administration from lowering their monthly payments as planned. Plan allows for student loan forgiveness In the legal challenge led by Kansas, the complaint argued that the SAVE plan \u201ctransforms many or most loans into outright grants from the federal government \u2014 without any appropriation from Congress.\u201d Borrowers enrolled in SAVE may be eligible for student debt relief in a shorter amount of time than under other income-driven plans. Those who borrowed $12,000 or less will see their debt forgiven after paying for just 10 years under SAVE. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount would add one year of monthly payments to the required time a borrower must pay. Under other repayment plans, borrowers must make at least 20 years of payments before receiving debt forgiveness. The estimated cost of the SAVE plan varies, ranging from the Biden administration\u2019s estimate of $138 billion over 10 years to $475 billion over the same period, according to an estimate from researchers at the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In comparison, Biden\u2019s one-time, signature student loan forgiveness program was expected to cost about $400 billion before it was struck down by the Supreme Court.

Biden is finalizing plans to propose major structural changes to the third branch of government. From a report by CNN\u2019s MJ Lee and Devan Cole: Biden\u2019s move is a long time coming for progressives and Democrats who have been pushing for court reform based on the following evidence: \u25ba Citing an election year in 2016, Republicans delayed the appointment of a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, refusing to hold a hearing for President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, now Biden\u2019s attorney general. \u25ba Ignoring their own election year precedent, Republicans rushed through the appointment of a successor to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, creating a new 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed justices that could last for decades. \u25ba That new majority went in the opposite direction of public opinion, upending decades of precedent and reversing a federal constitutional right to an abortion. \u25ba The conservative majority has also taken a more active role in striking down environmental policy while granting a form of superimmunity to presidents and reinterpreting the 2nd Amendment. \u25ba Justice Clarence Thomas has been found to have accepted multiple gifts from billionaire friends. \u25ba Thomas did not recuse himself from January 6, 2021, cases even though his wife actively worked with White House officials pushing for Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election. \u25ba Justices have ignored calls that they impose a binding ethics code on themselves. Biden has long opposed Supreme Court reform. In 1983, as a senator, Biden called Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s plan to place term limits on older justices and expand the size of the court \u201cboneheaded.\u201d He may still feel that way. Biden\u2019s proposal does not appear to include an expansion of the size of the court, although Congress has made the court larger and smaller multiple times. In 2020, during the Democratic primary, he was a voice against calls to reform the court, arguing that adding or subtracting justices would ruin its credibility. Instead, he promised to commission a panel to explore the issue. That commission \u2013 The Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States \u2013 issued its final report years ago, in December 2021. It explored various proposals for court reform, including expansion and term limits, but did not endorse any of them. It is very clear from the report that Congress has been fighting over the Supreme Court for all of US history. Commission members, who came from a breadth of ideologies, were split on whether Congress has the power to simply create a system of term limits for justices. There would also be obstacles to implementing the system over the course of years. There is historical precedent for expanding and contracting the court, on the other hand. The most notable effort to expand the court \u2013 opponents call it court packing \u2013 came from Franklin D. Roosevelt, who became frustrated when the Supreme Court of the day struck down New Deal policies. The report notes that while the court packing plan was ultimately defeated in Congress, the threat of changing the court clearly changed its behavior, what\u2019s known as a \u201cdoctrinal shift.\u201d From the Commission: Roosevelt\u2019s plan, unlike anything Biden is likely to propose, had some chance of passing. Roosevelt\u2019s Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority of 69 votes in 1937. Biden\u2019s Democrats are barely in the majority at the moment. Any Biden proposal would almost certainly be squashed by the Republican minority in the Senate if it were to come up for consideration this year. Next year, Republicans may hold power in the White House and the Senate with hopes to appoint new, young conservative justices, not modify the court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/bidens-41-year-evolution-on-supreme-court-reform/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick Ohio Sen. JD Vance was once a fervent critic of the former president. In private messages, he wondered ahead of Trump\u2019s election whether he was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and in 2017 said the then-president\u00a0was a\u00a0\u201cmoral disaster.\u201d In public, he agreed Trump was a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d who didn\u2019t care about regular people and called him \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler,\u201d Vance wrote in a message to a friend\u00a0in 2016. \u201cHow\u2019s that for discouraging?\u201d In 2016 and 2017, Vance, then best-known for penning the best-selling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d said Trump was \u201ccultural heroin\u201d and \u201cjust another opioid\u201d\u00a0for Middle America. He told CNN ahead of the 2016 election that he was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d voting for Trump and he also contemplated voting for Hillary Clinton (he ultimately said he planned to vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin.) \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us,\u201d\u00a0he tweeted\u00a0after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape was published in 2016. Vance also\u00a0liked tweets\u00a0that said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a deleted-tweet. Trump\u2019s vice president announcement on Monday caps a dramatic reversal on Vance\u2019s part. He made his most critical remarks when he was promoting his memoir\u00a0\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0which was published in 2016. The book had catapulted him to fame as a \u201cTrump whisperer,\u201d capable of explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to the White working class. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna vote for Trump\u00a0because I think that he\u2019s projecting very complex problems onto simple villains,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper ahead of the 2016 election. But by 2020, Vance fully embraced Trump, telling podcaster Megyn Kelly after the election he voted for him. A year\u00a0later,\u00a0Vance announced he was running for Senate in Ohio and vied for Trump\u2019s endorsement, which he ultimately received. But at the beginning of that campaign, Vance was\u00a0forced to apologize\u00a0after CNN resurfaced old tweets from the 2016 campaign and early in 2017 in Trump\u2019s administration that he had deleted. \u201cI did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance told Fox News\u00a0in 2021.\u00a0 In a\u00a0statement to CNN last month, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d for changing his mind on\u00a0the former president. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Vance won his Senate race in 2022 by\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0\u2013 less than the\u00a08.1 percentage points Trump\u00a0won the state\u00a0by\u00a0in 2020. Vance\u2019s remarkable political evolution underscores the broader trend of realignment in the country and the GOP as the party becomes one of\u00a0working-class\u00a0White\u00a0voters. \u2018I\u00a0don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks\u2019 In comments promoting his book, Vance often said Trump played\u00a0to\u00a0or exploited\u00a0White\u00a0working-class\u00a0voters\u2019 fears and prejudices. \u201cAnd I cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud,\u201d\u00a0one radio host said\u00a0to Vance when promoting his book in 2016. \u201cI think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people.\u201d \u201cI do too. And it\u2019s like you, like you said, I, I agree with you on Trump because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored.\u201d In\u00a0September 2016, Vance argued Trump\u2019s immigration policies like the \u201cgreat Mexican Wall,\u201d were overly simplistic and aimed to give folks something to latch on to. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Vance also argued in 2016 that if White working-class people attended church, they would not be as attracted to Trump. \u201cI think Trump provides that sense of community that many in the White working class would have, if they actually went to church,\u201d Vance\u00a0told\u00a0New York public radio. \u201cI think if folks went to church a little bit more, they may not be as excited or as attracted to the sort of social experience that Trump provides.\u201d Vance once said racism played a role in Trump support Vance also said that racism and xenophobia played a role in Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cThere is definitely an element of Donald Trump\u2019s support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia, but a lot of these folks are just really hardworking people who are struggling in really important ways,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in a September 2016\u00a0\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d\u00a0Interview. \u201cDefinitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in an interview at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. Speaking with CNN in October 2016, Vance criticized Trump for\u00a0\u201cactively antagonizing\u201d\u00a0Black voters, claiming this tactic was a long-standing Republican strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak to issues of special concern of minority voters or Black voters, it\u2019s that he seems to like actively antagonizing a lot of the Black voters,\u201d Vance\u00a0said during a panel discussion. In a July 2016 interview with American Conservative, a right-leaning publication, he added Trump was making the problem of racial resentment \u201cworse\u201d by talking about \u201crapist immigrants and banning all Muslims\u201d as part of his message. To that end \u2013 Vance once tweeted he found Trump reprehensible. \u201cTrump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\u201d\u00a0he wrote in October 2016.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_trump-shooting-rally-security-invs", "text": "When former President Donald Trump ascended the stage at last weekend\u2019s Pennsylvania rally to thunderous cheers, the campaign staffers present expected to hear a typical stump speech. What they didn\u2019t know: Law enforcement had spotted a suspicious person at the rally nearly an hour earlier and had been trying to find him. Just minutes after Trump started speaking, that same suspicious person \u2013 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks \u2013 opened fire at the former president, coming inches away from assassinating him. Members of Trump\u2019s team weren\u2019t told that law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks in the minutes before he took the stage, and there was no conversation over whether Trump should have delayed his entrance, sources who were at the rally with the former president told CNN. That\u2019s despite the fact that local police had spotted Crooks multiple times with a rangefinder, a hunting device similar to a pair of binoculars that calculates distance, and had circulated a photo of him they had taken. \u201cWe would have never let him go out there if we thought there was a threat to him,\u201d one source present with Trump told CNN. Beyond the looming question of why Crooks tried to kill Trump, the Secret Service is facing growing scrutiny over its security preparations and response at the rally \u2013 including why Trump was allowed to go onstage in the first place, and whether it was communicated to agents around him that people in the crowd had spotted the gunman on a nearby roof at least two minutes before the shooting. Secret Service and FBI briefers told members of Congress on Wednesday that law enforcement was trying to locate Crooks for at least 19 minutes before he fired but did not find him again until he was seen climbing on the roof outside the security perimeter, according to members who were in the briefing. Trump, who was running roughly an hour behind schedule when he arrived at the rally, went through his normal routine of taking photos backstage and mingling with a VIP crowd before walking through the tented command center that led to the stage, a second source present with Trump said. They added there was no delay between \u201cthe photo clicks,\u201d as the campaign calls it, to him walking to the podium at 6:02 p.m. A Secret Service source familiar with the incident told CNN that Crooks had been \u201cdeemed a suspicious person, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there was any indication that he was an immediate threat\u201d or had a weapon until just before the shooting. Suspicious people aren\u2019t uncommon at events like Trump rallies \u2013 even on Saturday, \u201ca guy tried to come in with a goat\u201d and a woman showed up \u201criding a horse with a giant Trump flag,\u201d and both were also deemed suspicious, the Secret Service source said. Four former Secret Service agents who spoke to CNN said that a report of a suspicious person by itself wouldn\u2019t necessarily have prompted a call to stop Trump from getting onstage. But they said communication failures between the various law enforcement agencies present at the rally likely contributed to the security breakdown that resulted in Trump\u2019s near-assassination. Joe Funk, a former Secret Service agent who served for more than 20 years, said that suspicious people showing up at presidential events is a \u201cvery common occurrence,\u201d and \u201cwe really hardly ever held the president back.\u201d But he questioned why the roof that Crooks ascended was not secured before the rally, and why reports that he was there did not lead to more immediate action to protect Trump. Videos show that spectators noticed Crooks on the roof and tried to point him out to police at least two minutes before he fired, but law enforcement did not respond in time. Tom Knights, the manager of the local Butler Township, said in a statement Wednesday that an officer had hoisted himself to the roof and saw Crooks, but dropped to the ground after the gunman aimed at him. The township police \u201cimmediately communicated the individual\u2019s location and that he was in possession of a weapon,\u201d Knights said, but Crooks started firing \u201cmoments\u201d later. \u201cIf you see a guy with a gun, somebody has to get word to the Secret Service and the Secret Service has to react immediately,\u201d Funk said. If a report had been radioed out that police were investigating a report of a man with a gun, \u201cthat might have given that Secret Service detail a couple seconds, 10, 15, 20 seconds, to remove the president. It\u2019s happened before.\u201d Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent and CNN law enforcement analyst, agreed that the security of the rally was marked by \u201cmultiple points of failure\u201d in communications and coordination. When Crooks initially approached a security checkpoint with a rangefinder \u2013 which law enforcement sources have told CNN happened about an hour before the shooting \u2013 it should have been \u201ca big, big red flag,\u201d Wackrow said. \u201cThe Secret Service should have engaged with the suspect right then and there with one of their protective intelligence teams to conduct a field interview.\u201d Later, Wackrow said, there should have been more security at the building who could have spotted Crooks as he ascended the nearby building and perched on the roof. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t that message get back to the Secret Service or additional resources to basically flood the field?\u201d Wackrow asked. \u201cAll it would take is for one person to have distracted that shooter to potentially prevent this attack from happening.\u201d Trump\u2019s advisers and family have\u00a0praised his personal Secret Service\u00a0detail,\u00a0some of whom have been with the former president since he was in the White House,\u00a0while still\u00a0criticizing the agency and its response. At an event hosted by CNN and Politico at the GOP convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, top Trump adviser Chris LaCivita accused Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of dodging lawmakers\u2019 questions. Asked if she should resign, he said, \u201cyeah, yeah, a hundred percent.\u201d Eric Trump, the former president\u2019s son, told CNN on Tuesday that the Secret Service agents \u201con that stage love him. They would take a bullet for him and they demonstrated that.\u201d But more broadly, he said, the Secret Service \u201clet somebody with a gun within 130 yards of the former president of the United States and very likely the future president of the United States, and there\u2019s got to be accountability for that.\u201d That\u2019s an assessment that multiple former personnel for the agency agree with. Former Secret Service agent Robert McDonald, who questioned how law enforcement surveillance could have \u201callowed him to now get on top of that roof,\u201d said that the incident could lead to changes in the agency\u2019s operating procedures. \u201cThe Secret Service needs to have looked inside itself to develop the answers to the questions of what happened here, why it happened, how it happened, and, more importantly, how we prevent this from happening again,\u201d he said. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general has opened an investigation into the shooting, and Secret Service leadership are expected to testify before Congress next week.

{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_aileen-cannon-removal-trump-classified-documents", "text": "Even after a year of\u00a0exasperating proceedings that featured several breaks from normal judicial procedure and that culminated in\u00a0a shock ruling dismissing\u00a0the classified documents indictment against Donald Trump, prosecutors would face\u00a0deeply unfavorable\u00a0odds at getting Judge Aileen Cannon removed from the case\u00a0if it is ever revived. In theory, special counsel Jack Smith could ask the 11th US\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals \u2013 which oversees federal appeals from Florida \u2013\u00a0to reassign the case to a different judge as part of his appeal of Cannon\u2019s ruling to dismiss the charges against the former president. But several veteran attorneys who practice in that circuit told CNN that the appeals court would be unlikely to grant such a request, even though Cannon\u2019s justification for throwing out the prosecution was widely panned by legal scholars. \u201cWhat we have here are adverse rulings and her not resolving the case quickly,\u201d said Jon Sale, a criminal defense attorney in Florida who served on the Watergate prosecution team. \u201cThe adverse rulings are not a basis for removal, and timing is in the broad discretion of the trial court.\u201d That means Smith\u2019s best possible outcome might be that the appeals court reverses Cannon\u2019s ruling invalidating his appointment, the Supreme Court lets that stand and several months from now \u2013 assuming Trump is not elected to the White House this November \u2013 the criminal case can pick up right where it left off, in front of Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Fort Pierce, Florida, who has shown no eagerness to get the proceedings to trial. \u201cThere really just is no record supporting her removal from the case. They just don\u2019t have any malfeasance to point to,\u201d said\u00a0CNN legal analyst Michael\u00a0Moore, who served as an Obama-appointed US attorney in Georgia, another state covered by the 11th Circuit. \u201cShe\u2019s been careful to not blindly issue rulings \u2026 and that has kept the record really shallow when looking for a removal rationale.\u201d Cannon\u2019s conclusion \u2013 that Congress had not given Attorney General Merrick Garland the power to appoint a special counsel like Smith and that, furthermore, Smith\u2019s office was funded in an unlawful fashion \u2013 went against rulings from federal district and appellate judges across the country that have upheld the Justice Department\u2019s use of other special counsels. It also was the capstone of her highly scrutinized handling of the historic Trump case, in which she was known to drag out the pretrial proceedings, entertain long-shot legal theories offered by the former president and issue cumbersome orders that flummoxed lawyers on both sides of the case. Well before Monday\u2019s ruling, outside cheerleaders of the special counsel, including many Trump critics, were calling on Smith to seek Cannon\u2019s removal from the case. But this is the first real opportunity to ask for the intervention of the 11th Circuit. That appeals court, while conservative, previously tore apart Cannon\u2019s handling of a 2022 lawsuit brought by Trump that sought to undermine the documents investigation, overturning her decision to appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to review the materials seized from Mar-a-Lago. Justice Clarence Thomas gives Cannon additional cover Making the calculus even more difficult for Smith is that he is appealing a ruling of Cannon\u2019s that was meticulously written and thoroughly thought through and put forward\u00a0a legal rationale that, just this month, was similarly laid out by a sitting Supreme Court justice. At 93 pages, the new opinion was far more in depth and comprehensive than the more surface-level rulings Cannon had previously issued that showed sympathy to Trump\u2019s arguments while rejecting his other bids to throw out the case. \u201cI don\u2019t think this rises to the level of an order that the court would necessitate reassignment to another judge,\u201d said Jon May, a Florida criminal defense attorney who called Cannon\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \u201cwrong\u201d but \u201cnot bonkers.\u201d\u2019 Cannon\u2019s ruling followed arguments laid out by Justice Clarence Thomas in a concurrence he wrote in the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity case, in which the conservative majority said that Trump had some immunity in Smith\u2019s separate case alleging 2020 election subversion. None of Thomas\u2019 eight colleagues signed on to his solo concurring opinion,\u00a0as Smith noted in court filings last week arguing to Cannon that the concurrence should not bear on the classified documents case. Thomas, it\u2019s worth noting, oversees emergency matters arising out of the 11th Circuit \u2013 something that appellate court will be \u201cmindful\u201d of when it handles Smith\u2019s appeal, according to CNN legal analyst Michael Moore. \u201cAbuse of discretion is a typical appellate standard of review,\u201d Moore said, referring to the standard the appeals court would likely use to reverse Cannon\u2019s dismissal ruling, \u201cbut not a reason for removal.\u201d Little precedent to look at Cannon has no doubt been antagonistic toward the special counsel\u2019s classified documents case. She\u2019s taken swipes at the Smith team in previous rulings and\u00a0suggested that fringe Trump theories that would hamstring the prosecution could play a role in an eventual trial. The way she has managed her docket has kept the case at a snail\u2019s pace, playing into Trump\u2019s strategy of delay. However, before Monday, her\u00a0decisions\u00a0on major motions mostly sided with the prosecutors \u2013 even as she weaved in jabs at their tactics \u2013 and she had avoided ruling on some of the most contentious issues in the case. While Cannon\u2019s approach to the case has attracted criticism, the current circumstances don\u2019t resemble past scenarios that have seen trial judges reassigned by the 11th Circuit. \u201cThis situation is so exceedingly rare, you don\u2019t really have precedent to look at,\u201d May said. \u201cYou have plenty of cases where there is concern for the defendant, and there\u2019s egregious orders and egregious behavior.\u201d On the occasions that a judge has been removed from a case by the 11th Circuit, it\u2019s often because the judge has heard evidence or a sentencing recommendation that shouldn\u2019t have been heard, according to Don Samuel, a criminal defense attorney in Georgia who wrote an in-depth book about the 11th Circuit\u2019s criminal law jurisprudence. Or it has happened when the judge has \u201crepeatedly\u201d refused to comply with the appeals court\u2019s instructions on a particular issue in a case, he said. \u201cBut reassignment just because the district judge made an erroneous decision?\u201d Samuel said. \u201cThat is virtually unheard of.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/aileen-cannon-removal-trump-classified-documents/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, said two-and-a-half years ago he was open to a national abortion ban, a stark contrast to comments he made this week where the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion should be a state issue. Vance argued in 2022 that people seeking abortions would travel from states where abortion is banned to states with liberal abortion laws, necessitating federal action. \u201cI certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,\u201d Vance said in January 2022 on a podcast when running for Senate. On Monday, the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion was a state issue, though in practice that means abortion can be banned in one state and entirely protected in another. \u201cMy view is that Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his views on abortion are going to be the views that dominate this party and drive this party forward,\u201d Vance said to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday. \u201cAlabama\u2019s going to make a different decision from California. That is a reasonable thing. And that\u2019s how I think we build some bridges and have some respect for one another.\u201d Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion, voters have consistently supported abortion rights in state measures, and the 2022 midterm elections saw numerous anti-abortion Republicans defeated. Many Republicans, including Vance, have shifted or moderated their abortion positions to align with the current political climate, where anti-abortion rhetoric and policies are seen as increasingly toxic and detrimental to election success. After Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in 2023, effectively repealing the state\u2019s six-week ban, Vance critiqued the Republican Party\u2019s messaging on abortion. \u201cWe have to recognize how much voters mistrust us (meaning elected Republicans) on this issue,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. Vance\u2019s office pointed CNN to past statements on abortion from Vance as a senator, including one from CNN last December where he said, \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\u201d He also expressed support for exceptions in the case of the \u201clife of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d Vance once supported a \u201cnational minimum standard\u201d for abortion restrictions and signaled support for a 15-week federal abortion ban to CNN before determining there was no appetite for it in the current climate. Yet in January 2022, Vance argued that while lawmakers couldn\u2019t ban abortion in the current climate, he was sympathetic to the view that a national ban was necessary. Vance proposed a hypothetical scenario where if Roe vs. Wade was overturned and Ohio banned abortion by 2024, liberal mega donor and philanthropist George Soros \u2014 a popular bogeyman in conservative circles might then facilitate abortions for \u201cdisproportionately black women\u201d by flying them to California. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here\u2019s a situation \u2014 let\u2019s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let\u2019s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity \u2014 uh, that\u2019s kind of creepy.\u201d \u201cAnd, and it\u2019s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?\u201d Vance said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sympathetic to that actually. So, you know, how hopefully we get to a point where Ohio bans abortion in California and the Soroses of the world respect it.\u201d \u201cThe left has this weird desire to conquer everything, right? So I tend to think that these balances are always a little tenuous and eventually, either on any given issue, the left is gonna win or we\u2019re gonna win,\u201d he concluded. On Monday, delegates at the Republican National Convention approved their party\u2019s new platform with toned-down rhetoric on abortion that aligned with Trump\u2019s state-based approach to the issue. The move has angered some anti-abortion groups who opposed abandoning the party\u2019s old long-standing language, including the de-emphasis on abortion restrictions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_the-politics-of-jd-vance-as-told-in-hillbilly-elegy", "text": "It\u2019s a story \u2014 young memoirist with an Ivy League law degree tells a compelling story, catapults into the Senate and joins the national political conversation \u2014 familiar to anyone who followed the career of Barack Obama. But instead of Obama, the memoirist of the moment is JD Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio, who has been tapped by former President Donald Trump as his vice presidential running mate and, at 39, the next generation of the MAGA movement. Vance\u2019s book, like Obama\u2019s, is about a young man largely raised by his grandparents and overcoming themes of alienation. Vance\u2019s\u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d was also turned into a Ron Howard movie. \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d caused a sensation after Trump\u2019s election in 2016 as people tried to understand how Democrat Hillary Clinton had lost the Rust Belt states. The book, with touching stories about Vance\u2019s upbringing, his drug-addicted mother and his foul-mouthed, gun-toting grandmother, attempts to explain the disaffection of the white, working-class Americans who felt like American society was passing them by as they witnessed the decay of once-thriving towns. Vance has clearly evolved since the book\u2019s publication. He opposed Trump when it was first published just before the 2016 election and is now on the same presidential ticket, a full-fledged Trump acolyte. Trump\u2019s and Vance\u2019s stories are about as opposite as it is possible for the stories of two white men to be. Trump built his business career with loans from his father. Vance dropped his biological father\u2019s name, Donald, to simply become JD. Trump was born into wealth in a city where he lived most of his life. Vance counts his home as Kentucky, where his grandparents were from and where he visited as a child. Trump avoided service in Vietnam. Vance enlisted in the Marines and deployed to Iraq. Where Trump has an \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d view of the world, Vance takes a far more humble approach to his own abilities and credits others with helping him succeed despite despair in his home town. Here are some quotes from the book that struck me on a rereading: Vance\u2019s grandparents didn\u2019t graduate from high school and they moved, he says, from Kentucky to Ohio when his grandmother was pregnant at the age of 14, in search of work and a better life. His grandfather made a life as a steelworker and, despite his mother\u2019s descent into addiction, his grandparents were among \u201ca handful of loving people (who) rescued me.\u201d He feels kinship with people whose families, like his, have roots in Appalachia and have not kept pace with social mobility in the US. There are multiple passages about how views in these communities about how a man should act are hurting men, who, he says, drop out of the labor force and refuse to relocated for opportunity. While Vance acknowledges that his Mamaw only survived in her later years with government help, there is a marked disdain for programs that help people who are not old. Vance says: Much of the book is built around Vance\u2019s relationship with his grandmother, Mamaw, \u201cthe toughest woman anyone knew,\u201d who died in 2005 and who he lovingly mentioned in his speech Wednesday at the Republican National Convention. The book is filled with foul-mouthed quotes and gun-toting anecdotes about her and other members of his Kentucky forebears. At a time when immigration plays such an important role in national politics, it\u2019s interesting that migration within the US is a key component of Vance\u2019s book. His family and millions of others like them had to move to make their way in the world. His grandparents were Democrats because of social class. He argues that the American Dream felt attainable to his grandparents\u2019 generation. The book is specifically about white, working-class Americans. But at several points Vance compares the plight of white Americans in Appalachia and in the Rust Belt to that of Black Americans left behind in American cities. Vance takes a dim view of people who complain about lack of work in their towns. He says many of them are lazy. Now a practicing Catholic, he is frustrated that more people in the Rust Belt do not attend church and he repeatedly argues that churches can provide support to people who are in need. In one key section describing a job during his teenage years at a grocery store in roughly the early 2000s, Vance expresses anger at people getting help from the government, but able to have phones, which were not as ubiquitous back then. It was seeing people \u201clive off the dole,\u201d that began to turn Vance against Democrats, although I have to say that reading this passage today I\u2019m not sure how many people getting food assistance are buying T-bone steaks. A general move away from Democrats in the Rust Belt could be explained through a racial lens, by the Democrats\u2019 embrace of the Civil Rights movement, or for social reasons, as evangelical Christians gravitated to the right. But Vance says an aggrieved perception of welfare programs is largely to blame. He also tells the story of his grandmother\u2019s frustration when a neighbor rents out his house as a Section 8 property. Conversely, Mamaw would also bristle that ballots to raise taxes for local schools would fail. Eventually, Middletown, Ohio, began to founder much as the Kentucky of Mamaw\u2019s youth. Vance sees a general societal decline in these areas and it\u2019s about more than a lack of jobs. Vance prizes hard work and thoughtful financial decisions. He joins the Marines specifically in order to afford college, so it should be no surprise that today he is a vehement critic of student loan forgiveness. There is also a passage where, as an Ohio State student, he describes making use of a payday loan. He argued that while these loans might have exorbitant interest rates and appear rapacious to consumer advocates, the loan was there when he needed it. So he opposed a bill then under consideration in Ohio to regulate payday loans. As Vance headed off to Yale Law School, his future bright after years of work, he began to feel out of place in Middletown, where despair was growing. There are the beginnings of a desire for a populist hero. Vance does not see racism in the rejection by many White Rust Belt viewers of Obama, but rather anti-elitism. He also sees a failing on the right to promote accountability and inspire people to succeed. Vance feels out of place in Middletown, but also at Yale. He also becomes more health-conscious during the course of the book. At one point, Vance meets a politician from Indiana. One can imagine Daniels, a former Indiana governor and George W. Bush official who is opposed by the MAGA wing of the GOP, is no longer Vance\u2019s hero. The short final chapter that suggests social policy needs to do more to understand the white working class, but it\u2019s not particularly detailed. Vance points out that his rise was built on government help, including student loans, the old age benefits his grandmother shared with him and the public schools of his youth and college years. He argues that the country should do more to integrate low-income people into the middle class. The closest he comes to a policy proposal is frustration at how the federal government applies Section 8 housing assistance. Later, he admits that answers are hard to come by.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/the-politics-of-jd-vance-as-told-in-hillbilly-elegy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_takeaways-rnc-day-4", "text": "On a night Republicans projected bravado around their 2024 presidential ticket, Donald Trump started his prime-time address by displaying a rare vulnerability. In his speech capping off the Republican National Convention as he accepted the party\u2019s nomination for a third consecutive election, Trump recounted Thursday night his attempted assassination five days earlier at a Pennsylvania rally. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here tonight,\u201d he told the crowd at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. After the crowd chanted back, \u201cYes, you are,\u201d Trump shook his head. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d Then it was back to the usual Trump. Often, he went off script to attack his political enemies, laud the dismissal of one of his indictments and tick through crowd favorites in the longest nomination acceptance speech in modern American history. He bragged about the economy and lack of new foreign entanglements during his presidency, and he lambasted President Joe Biden\u2019s administration for its handling of border security, energy, foreign policy and more. Delivering a script that was intended to offer a unifying message, Trump said he would only use Biden\u2019s name once. But he did so, he said, to say the Democratic incumbent was a worse president than the nation\u2019s prior 10 worst, combined. As much as Republicans sought to make unity the theme, there were still incendiary figures such as far-right media personality Tucker Carlson on stage Thursday, and plenty of jabs at Democrats. The former president\u2019s son Eric Trump delivered conservative red meat, much like his brother Donald Trump Jr. had a night earlier. Then, the 45th president bemoaned what he described as a politicized justice system and \u201cpartisan witch hunts.\u201d He falsely accused Democrats of \u201ccheating on elections.\u201d Here are five takeaways from the RNC\u2019s final night: Trump details shooting In the days leading up to Thursday\u2019s speech, Trump allies have said that the weekend\u2019s assassination attempt had changed the former president. As he accepted his party\u2019s nomination, Trump seemed more emotional, and solemn, than Americans are use to seeing him as he recounted the \u201cpainful\u201d events of his Saturday rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The former president narrated the attack in minute detail. As he described when he heard the would-be assassin\u2019s bullet whizz by his ear, photos of the moment appeared on the screens behind him.\u00a0Later, the screens displayed the moment when, with blood streaming from his ear, he raised a fist and let the crowd know he was OK. He praised the Pennsylvania crowd for not stampeding out of the rally area, which he attributed to their bravery and concern for him. He insisted, despite chants from the audience, that he wasn\u2019t supposed to be at the convention. \u201cI stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God,\u201d Trump told the crowd. Trump also took a moment to honor Corey Comperatore, the former fire chief and Butler rally attendee who was fatally shot while shielding his family during the Butler rally. The former president walked across the stage, where Comperatore\u2019s protective gear was on display, and kissed his helmet. Trump announced that a\u00a0fundraiser for the families of Comperatore and those injured at the rally\u00a0had raised more than $6.3 million and asked for a moment of silence in Comperatore\u2019s memory. The tribute to Comperatore built on a theme of empathy the Trump campaign has cultivated throughout the week with stories of the former president reaching out to Gold Star families and showing compassion to his staff in private moments. Little mention of Biden (by name) Trump said Thursday night that he would use Biden\u2019s name only once. (He used it twice: Once to describe Biden as the worst president in history, and again to say it would be the only time it was used.) It was, in part, because Trump\u2019s campaign wanted to showcase a unified and forward-looking Republican Party \u2014 a stark contrast to what Democrats could be facing when they gather in Chicago next month. But it\u2019s also because Trump might not face Biden again, after all. As Republicans rallied around Trump, Democrats increasingly sought to throw Biden overboard. A drumbeat of reports from CNN and other news organizations about top Democrats urging Biden to drop his reelection bid amid voters\u2019 concerns about his age grew louder throughout the week. Thursday night, CNN reported that many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials now privately believe that Biden must abandon his campaign for a second term \u2013 and soon. For Trump, a standard-fare speech will keep the focus just where his campaign wants it: on Biden. A rare Melania Trump sighting Melania Trump has kept a low profile since the Trump administration ended. She did not attend the former president\u2019s hush money trial or the first general election debate of this cycle between Trump and Biden. And although the former first lady appeared at his campaign announcement back in 2022 and has headlined fundraisers for her husband, her presence overall on the campaign trail has been much more muted than what\u2019s normal for spouses of presidential candidates. As recently as March, campaign aides stressed that while\u00a0Melania\u00a0Trump would have\u00a0some\u00a0kind of role in her husband\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign, it wasn\u2019t clear exactly what that role would be. In previous election years, Melania\u00a0Trump delivered speeches at the RNC. This year, she did not, instead appearing for the first time on Thursday night, with an extended classical music soundtrack playing as she walked into the arena. Trump evidently understood the significance of his wife\u2019s attendance at the RNC. At one point in his speech, he said, \u201cI am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife.\u201d He added that the two-page letter she wrote to the country in response to the assassination attempt \u201ccaptivated so many.\u201d \u2018Trumpamania\u2019 running wild The theme of Thursday night\u2019s RNC lineup in the lead-up to Trump\u2019s speech was testosterone. And just in case that wasn\u2019t already clear by the time Hulk Hogan took the stage, the professional wrestler left no doubt when he cast aside his blazer, ripped off his T-shirt and declared Trump \u201ca real American hero.\u201d The night featured Trump introductions from Kid Rock and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, as well as a band blasting 1980s hits and a speech from a Trump golf course manager. There\u2019s a strategic reason for it: Republicans have long won male voters, and the Trump campaign has paid particular attention to trying to narrow Democrats\u2019 massive advantages among non-White men. But Hogan\u2019s speech might have been one of the most memorable moments of the entire convention \u2014 in part because it so perfectly embodied the story Trump has long sold. Hogan briefly broke character to tell the crowd his real name (Terry Bollea) and, much like Trump, described himself as a professional entertainer who couldn\u2019t stay on the political sidelines. \u201cI\u2019ve known that man for over 35 years, and he\u2019s always been the biggest patriot, and he still is,\u201d he said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s always told you exactly what he thought, and he still does, brother.\u201d Then, back into his Hogan character, he finished with a characteristic flourish. \u201cAll you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags, all you drug dealers and all you crooked politicians need to answer one question, brother,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?\u201d A nearly policy-free convention Political conventions are rarely confused with administrative meetings, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that Republicans in Milwaukee this week avoided wonky policy chatter. But even by the usual standards, which typically involve acknowledging a problem and then short-handing a solution, the 2024 RNC was perplexing. And especially so on its final night, when the politicians mostly gave way to right-leaning celebrities. Hogan, for example, was never expected to bring a stash of white papers onstage with him. One of his lesser-noted riffs, though, actually summarized the RNC quite neatly. \u201cWe had a thriving economy, strong borders. We had safe streets. We had peace and respect around the world,\u201d Hogan said, offering a rosy recollection of Trump\u2019s time in office. \u201cBut then we lost it all in a blink of an eye. Crime is out of control. The border is out of control. The price of food and gas and housing is out of control. And the only person who can clean this up is Donald Trump.\u201d In that respect, for all the talk of a \u201cnew tone\u201d and calls for unity around very real problems, this RNC was very much like the 2016 edition, when Trump memorably declared of all the country\u2019s ills: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d Just how he will go about lowering grocery bills, home prices, interest rates, gas and food prices \u2013 some of which are already coming down \u2013 was left to the imagination. To the extent there is an existing political manifesto for Republicans in 2024, the so-called Project 2025, Trump, his campaign and rank-and-file officials have mostly run away screaming from it. A nearly 900-page wish list for a second Trump term, the \u201cproject\u201d and its calls to further restrict abortion and stamp out climate initiatives while giving the president near total control of government bureaucracy has become a useful political cudgel for Democrats. Trump, in turn, has said he knows \u201cnothing\u201d about it.\u201d If this past week in Milwaukee was any indication, he might be telling the truth.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/takeaways-rnc-day-4/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_fact-checking-night-4-republican-national-convention-trump", "text": "Former President Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday with the most dishonest speech of the four-day Republican National Convention, making more than 20 false claims by CNN\u2019s count. Many of the false claims were ones Trump has made before, some of them for years. They spanned a wide variety of topics, including the economy, immigration, crime, foreign policy and elections. Some of them were wild lies, others smaller exaggerations. Some were in his prepared text (like the absurd claim that he left the Biden administration a world at peace), while he ad-libbed others (such as his usual lies that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election and that the US is experiencing the worst inflation it has ever had). Below is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s false or misleading remarks, plus a fact check of claims made by other Thursday convention speakers. Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden. Former President Donald Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden. Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. The current inflation rate, 3% in June 2024, is nowhere near the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920.  Trump could fairly say that the\u00a0inflation rate\u00a0hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but it has since plummeted. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s misleading claim about North Korean missile launches during his presidency Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that he \u201cgot along with\u201d North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and \u201cwe stopped the missile launches from North Korea.\u201d \u201cBut, no, I got along with him,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now North Korea is acting up again.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim that he \u201cstopped the missile launches\u201d from North Korea is misleading. While missile launches did pause from North Korea for a period of time during his administration, they started up again before he left office.\u00a0 A May 2019 launch of what was assessed to be a short-range ballistic missile was North Korea\u2019s first since 2017, which was seen as a sign of growing frustration from Kim on the state of talks with the US. North Korea later launched two more missiles in July 2019, a month after Trump\u2019s high-profile meeting with Kim in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. North Korea conducted four missile tests in 2020. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on his claims of defeating ISIS in \u201ccouple of months\u201d Former President Donald Trump claimed in his RNC speech that \u201cwe defeated 100% of ISIS in Syria and Iraq,\u00a0something that was going to take five years. \u2026 We did it in a matter of a couple of months.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim of having defeated ISIS in \u201ca couple of months\u201d isn\u2019t true; the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq in late December 2018, as he has suggested in past remarks, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has before, when he said he defeated the terror group with no caveats or credit to anyone else. Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016. IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. \u201cThe Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group\u2019s governance project,\u201d an analyst there said in a statement at the time. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Donald Trump\u2019s misleading claim that federal judge ruled case against him was \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 Donald Trump said Thursday that the Florida federal judge who was overseeing the classified documents case dismissed the criminal charges against the former president, finding \u201cthat the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional.\u201d Facts first:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is misleading. District Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting the case, violated the Constitution. But Cannon specifically did not comment on the validity of the charges Trump was facing, or whether Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper. In a 93-page ruling\u00a0Monday, Cannon said\u00a0Smith\u2019s appointment\u00a0violated the Constitution. Cannon said that Smith\u2019s position as special counsel \u201ceffectively usurps\u201d Congress\u2019 \u201cimportant legislative authority,\u201d because Congress should have the authority \u2013 not the head of the Justice Department \u2013 to appoint such an official. Cannon also said that Smith\u2019s\u00a0office was being funded improperly. But Cannon also specifically noted that she was not deciding any \u201cother legal rights or claims\u201d brought by Trump or his co-defendants in the case. The judge also said that the Justice Department could potentially revive the case by funding the special counsel through different means. Prosecutors from outside the special counsel\u2019s office could also refile the charges. From CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz Trump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security During his Republican National Convention speech, former President Donald Trump again said that Democrats are harming Social Security and Medicare by letting migrants into the US. \u201cDemocrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people by the millions are coming in \u2013 they\u2019re going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things, and you\u2019re not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true, particularly in the near term, multiple experts say. Many undocumented immigrants work, which means they pay much-needed payroll taxes, and this bolsters the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and extends their solvency. Immigrants who are working legally typically won\u2019t collect benefits for many years. As for those who are undocumented, some are working under fake Social Security numbers, so they are paying payroll taxes but don\u2019t qualify to collect benefits. The Social Security Administration looked at the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security trust funds. It found that in 2010, earnings by unauthorized workers contributed roughly $12 billion on net to the entitlement program\u2019s cash flow. The agency has not updated the analysis since, but this year\u2019s Social Security trustees report noted that increasing average annual total net immigration by\u00a0100,000 persons\u00a0improves the entitlement program\u2019s solvency. \u201cWe estimate that future years will experience a continuation of this positive impact on the trust funds,\u201d said the\u00a0report on unauthorized immigration. Meanwhile, unauthorized immigrants contributed more than\u00a0$35 billion\u00a0on net to Medicare\u2019s trust fund between 2000 and 2011, extending the life of the trust fund by a year, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. \u201cImmigrants tend to be younger and employed, which increases the number of workers paying into the system,\u201d said Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor. \u201cAlso, they have more children, which helps boost the future workforce that will pay payroll taxes.\u201d \u201cImmigrants are good for Social Security,\u201d he said. However, undocumented immigrants who gain legal status that includes eligibility for future Social Security and Medicare benefits could ultimately be a drain to the system, according to Jason Richwine, a resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. \u201cIllegal immigration unambiguously benefits the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, but amnesty (legalization) would reverse those gains and add extra costs,\u201d\u00a0Richwine wrote\u00a0in a report last year. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump on trade deal with China Former President Donald Trump claimed that he struck a trade deal with China, requiring the country to purchase $50 billion worth of American products. \u201cThey buy $50 billion worth,\u201d he said at the Republican National Convention Thursday. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that China bought $50 billion worth of American product as a result of a trade deal is false. Trump is referring to what is known as the\u00a0Phase One deal\u00a0he struck with Beijing in December 2019. While the deal required China to buy\u00a0$50 billion worth of American agricultural products\u00a0by the end of 2021 \u2013 Beijing\u00a0did not live up to its commitment. US agricultural exports to China recovered from the trade war but did not reach the levels in the Phase One commitments, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco Donald Trump exaggerates how much higher gas prices are right now Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump described gas prices\u00a0inaccurately during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention. He said that \u201cgas prices are up 60%.\u201d Facts First: The average price of a regular gallon of gasoline nationwide is $3.51 as of Thursday, according to AAA. That\u2019s up about 47% from the day President Joe Biden was inaugurated, when the average was $2.39, not 60% higher as Trump claimed. Although the United States has a strategic gasoline reserve, which can be tapped by the White House to ease upward pressure on prices,\u00a0as Biden did in May, gas prices are still mostly determined by\u00a0market forces, such as global petroleum production and consumer demand, not solely by the decisions of a sitting US president. From CNN\u2019s Bryan Mena Trump claims government hired 88,000 IRS agents Former President Donald Trump, while recounting a conversation he had with a waitress worried about the taxes on her tips, claimed that the government recently hired 88,000 IRS agents to audit individuals. Facts First:\u00a0This claim is false.\u00a0 The Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 which Congress passed in 2022 without any Republican votes \u2013 provided an about $80 billion, 10-year investment to the IRS. The agency plans to hire tens of thousands of\u00a0IRS\u00a0employees with that money \u2013 but only some will be IRS agents who conduct audits and investigations. Many people will be hired for non-agent roles, such as customer service representatives. And a significant number of the hires are expected to fill the vacant posts left by retirements and other attrition, not take newly created positions. The 88,000 figure comes from a\u00a02021 Treasury Department report\u00a0that estimated the IRS could hire 86,852 full-time employees \u2013 not solely enforcement agents \u2013 over the course of a decade with a nearly $80 billion investment. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco Trump on Biden increasing Americans\u2019 taxes by four times Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim that President Joe Biden wants to hike people\u2019s taxes by four times. \u201cThis is the only administration that said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna raise your taxes by four times what you\u2019re paying now,\u2019\u201d Trump said Thursday in his speech at the Republican National Convention. Facts First:\u00a0This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024.\u00a0 Biden has not proposed quadrupling Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN in May that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s claim on the situation before the \u2018Right to Try\u2019 law Former President Donald Trump touted the \u201cRight to Try\u201d law he signed in 2018 in his convention speech Thursday, which gave terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven\u2019t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Before the measure was passed, Trump claimed,\u00a0terminally ill patients in the United States would have to go to foreign countries to seek experimental treatments or go home to die if they couldn\u2019t afford it. \u201cSounds simple, but it\u2019s not, and I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will \u2013 \u00a0instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place \u2013 or if you have no money, going home and dying,\u201d he said. Facts First: This is misleading. It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications \u2013 but the government almost always said yes. Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump\u2019s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own \u201cexpanded access\u201d program. \u2018\u201cEmergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,\u201d Gottlieb testified. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Trump\u2019s claim about Russian warships near Cuba Former President Donald claimed in his RNC speech on Wednesday evening that \u201cRussian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off our coasts in Cuba. \u2026 The press refuses to write about it.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s present-tense claim that Russian warships and nuclear submarines \u201care\u201d operating close to the United States is misleading. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left. A group of four Russian Navy vessels\u00a0arrived in Cuba\u00a0on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The vessels left Havana on June 17. It is also not true that media organizations \u201cdon\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0CNN,\u00a0along\u00a0with\u00a0most\u00a0other\u00a0major news\u00a0outlets, reported on the Russian ships\u2019 positioning. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump on military equipment left in Afghanistan Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim, which he has made in\u00a0speech\u00a0after\u00a0speech,\u00a0that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021. Trump said, \u201cAnd we also left $85 billion dollars\u2019 worth of military equipment.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has\u00a0estimated\u00a0that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously\u00a0explained, the \u201c$85 billion\u201d is a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s false claim that the \u2018world was at peace\u2019 during his administration Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday, as many others at the RNC did, that while he was president the world was at peace. \u201cOur opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war,\u201d he also claimed later in his speech. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim about world peace under his presidency is false. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021. \u00a0\u00a0 US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa\u2019s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico\u2019s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump on Venezuela\u2019s crime rate Former President Donald Trump said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that \u201cin Venezuela, crime is down 72%\u201d because foreign governments are sending their countries\u2019 criminals to the US. Facts First:\u00a0Trump greatly overstated the Biden-era decline in crime in Venezuela, at least according to the limited statistics that are publicly available.\u00a0 And while it is certain that at least some criminals have joined law-abiding Venezuelans in a mass exodus from the country amid the economic crisis of the last decade, there is no proof Venezuela\u2019s government has deliberately emptied prisons for migration purposes or intentionally sent ex-prisoners to the United States. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s evidence-free claim on immigration Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that immigrants are \u201ccoming from prisons, they\u2019re coming from jails, they\u2019re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. \u2026 Terrorists are coming in at numbers we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that jails around the world are being emptied out so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants, nor for his claim that foreign governments are also emptying out mental health facilities for this purpose. Last year, Trump\u2019s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US. Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump\u2019s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN\u2019s own search did not produce any evidence. The website\u00a0FactCheck.org\u00a0also found nothing. Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that\u2019s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom. In response to CNN\u2019s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump\u2019s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes \u2013 a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela\u2019s actions has never been corroborated. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump\u2019s false claim on US crime statistics Former President Donald Trump claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that \u201cour crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim about a dramatic increase in the crime rate is false. Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime\u00a0dropped significantly in the US in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump\u2019s last calendar year in office. Preliminary FBI data for 2023\u00a0showed\u00a0a roughly\u00a013% national decline in murder\u00a0and a roughly 6% national decline in overall reported violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 \u2013 a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall reported violent crime. There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement \u2013 the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data\u00a0usually has some initial errors\u00a0\u2013 so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources\u00a0make it clear crime has indeed\u00a0declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline \u201cever recorded.\u201d And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also \u201ccrime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Trump blames Biden administration for \u2018greatest invasion in history\u2019 During his RNC speech, former President Donald Trump claimed that the Biden administration has done nothing to curb illegal immigration to the US. \u201cThe greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country\u2014they are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East,\u201d Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re coming at levels we\u2019ve never seen before it is an invasion indeed and this administration does nothing to stop them.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that the Biden administration is doing \u201cnothing\u201d is incorrect.\u00a0Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration.\u00a0\u00a0Arrests along the US southern border dropped 29% in June, according to\u00a0new data\u00a0released by US Customs and Border Protection, following the Biden administration\u2019s order\u00a0severely limiting asylum-seeker crossings.\u201cRecent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,\u201d CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller previously said in a statement. Last month, the Biden administration\u00a0invoked an authority to shut off access\u00a0to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally,\u00a0a significant attempt\u00a0to address one of the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities. It was the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border, using the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand Trump makes claims about grocery prices rising under Biden Former President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that groceries are up 57% during the Biden administration. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims of grocery prices being up 57% are false and could use some context. Inflation\u2019s\u00a0rapid ascent,\u00a0which began in early 2021, was the result of a\u00a0confluence of factors, including effects from the Covid-19 pandemic such as\u00a0snarled supply chains\u00a0and\u00a0geopolitical fallout\u00a0(specifically Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine) that triggered food and energy price shocks.\u00a0Heightened consumer demand\u00a0boosted in part by fiscal stimulus from both the\u00a0Trump\u00a0and\u00a0Biden\u00a0administrations also led to higher prices, as did the post-pandemic imbalance in the labor market. Inflation peaked at 9.1%\u00a0in June 2022, hitting a 41-year high, and has slowed since (the Consumer Price Index\u00a0was at 3% as of June 2024). However, it remains elevated from historical levels. Three-plus years of pervasive and prolonged inflation has\u00a0weighed considerably on Americans, especially lower-income households trying to afford the necessities (food, shelter and transportation). Food prices, specifically grocery prices, did outpace overall inflation\u00a0for much of 2022 and 2023, driven higher by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Still, grocery prices didn\u2019t rise to the extent that Trump claims. Annual food and grocery inflation peaked at 11.4% and 13.5% in August 2022, respectively. Since Biden took office, the CPI \u201cfood at home\u201d index is up 21%, which is higher than its 9% typical rise in recent history over a 54-month period, but it\u2019s not 57%. Through the 12 months that ended in June, overall food and grocery prices\u00a0were up just\u00a02.2%\u00a0and\u00a01.1%, respectively. Certain food categories saw much greater inflation: Notably,\u00a0egg prices were up 70% annually\u00a0in January 2023. However, the\u00a0underlying cause of that sharp increase\u00a0was a highly contagious, deadly avian flu. Food prices are highly volatile and can be influenced by a variety of factors, especially disease,\u00a0extreme weather events, global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and once-in-a-lifetime pandemics. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Trump\u2019s misleading claim about energy independence Former President Donald Trump claimed that the US was \u201cenergy independent\u201d during his presidency but that this changed under President Joe Biden. Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading. \u201cEnergy independent\u201d is a political phrase, not a literal phrase, that can be defined in various ways \u2013 and, under Biden, the US has continued to satisfy the same definitions it satisfied under Trump. US production of oil and gas have set records under Biden. \u201cEnergy independent\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the US uses no foreign energy or that it is untethered from global energy markets; this wasn\u2019t the case under Trump and still isn\u2019t under Biden. Experts in energy policy tend to scoff at the term \u201cenergy independence,\u201d with three experts\u00a0telling CNN in 2022\u00a0that it is a \u201chorrible term,\u201d \u201cridiculous term\u201d and \u201cstupid term,\u201d respectively. But if the term is defined as the US exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, that has\u00a0happened in every year under Biden\u00a0after happening under Trump in 2020 for\u00a0the first time in decades. (In fact, the US surplus in petroleum trade has\u00a0grown under Biden\u00a0as US crude oil\u00a0production and\u00a0exports have hit new highs) And if the term is defined as the US producing more energy than it consumes, that has also\u00a0continued to happen under Biden\u00a0after\u00a0happening under Trump in 2019for the first time in decades. You can read\u00a0here about the various economic reasons the US has imported foreign energy under both Trump and Biden despite its so-called \u201cenergy independence.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Trump\u2019s false claim on his tax cuts Former President Donald Trump once again claimed\u00a0that he signed the largest tax cuts in history during his administration. \u201cWe got credit for the war, and defeating ISIS, and so many things. The great economy, the biggest tax cuts ever, the biggest regulation cuts ever, the creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much,\u201d Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. Facts First:\u00a0This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released in June, the\u00a0federal government\u2019s nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger \u2013 former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy \u2013 over five years. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and Obama\u2019s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the\u00a0eighth largest\u00a0since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby\u00a0 Trump\u2019s false claim US had \u2018no\u2019 inflation during his presidency Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that inflation did not exist during his presidency \u2013 drawing a contrast between his administration and that of President Joe Biden, whose early years in office were plagued by decades-high inflation. \u201cWe had no inflation,\u201d Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s comment is false. Inflation was low, but not nothing. The Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump\u2019s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Trump repeats frequent claim about oil drilling and gas prices As he has done repeatedly on the campaign trail, Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that under a new Trump administration, the United States would \u201cdrill, baby, drill, \u2026 by doing that, we will lead to a large-scale decline in prices.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s frequent campaign claim that the US can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil is misleading. Under President Joe Biden, US oil production has reached a new record this year, even surpassing output under Trump\u2019s administration. The Energy Information Administration expects crude oil production to hit successive records this year and next, powered by an oil boom in the Permian Basin. As CNN has reported, the US currently produces more oil than any other country on the planet, at about half a million barrels per day more than the prior annual record set in 2019. Prices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and the US cannot be truly energy independent when it comes to gas prices, energy experts have told CNN. Oil is a global commodity; the global price of oil determines US gas prices and it\u2019s simply impossible to separate that price from shifting global dynamics like Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine or OPEC\u2019s recent decisions to cut oil production. \u201cWhether we\u2019re drill baby, drilling has more to do with what the price of crude oil is, how healthy is the economy,\u201d Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN recently. \u201cThese things are outside of a president\u2019s direct control.\u201d There\u2019s also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, McNally told CNN last year. McNally compared the light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee. US oil refineries are specifically built to separate out the \u201cheavy and gunky\u201d crude we consume, McNally said. From CNN\u2019s Ella Nilsen\u00a0 Pompeo falsely\u00a0claims Biden \u2018won\u2019t even talk about\u2019\u00a0American hostages\u00a0in Gaza Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on Thursday that President Joe Biden \u201cwon\u2019t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held\u201d in Gaza. \u201cAnd now of course a second war in Gaza. President Biden won\u2019t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held there by the Iranian regime,\u201d Pompeo said. Facts First: The claim that Biden \u201cwon\u2019t even talk about\u201d the American hostages in Gaza is false. Biden has spoken about the Americans held in Gaza in the wake of Hamas\u2019 invasion of Israel several times since October.  Recently on May 31, speaking about a proposed deal for Israel and Hamas, Biden said American hostages would be released in the first phase of the deal: \u201c[W]e want them home.\u201d On October 25, Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock together with our partners in\u00a0the region to secure the release of hostages including American citizens \u2026 left behind.\u201d On November 26, he spoke extensively about the release of an Israeli American little girl who was held hostage and said he was pressing for more Americans to be released, adding, \u201cwe will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones.\u201d Most recently, at the NATO Summit in DC last week, Biden talked about hostages broadly, saying the US \u201chas been working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, to bring the hostages home, to create a path for peace and stability in the Middle East.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Trump biographical video includes false and misleading claims The Republican National Convention played a biographical video about former President Donald Trump before Trump began his own speech. The video included false and misleading claims. The Trump tax cuts The video featured a narrator making a claim that Trump himself\u00a0frequently utters. The narrator said, \u201cThe Trump tax cuts: largest in America\u2019s history.\u201d This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. You can read a detailed fact check here. Global conflict under Trump The video\u2019s narrator also delivered a version of another claim Trump has\u00a0made repeatedly, saying Trump\u2019s \u201cstrength and resolve\u201d produced \u201ca stable\u00a0world at peace.\u201d This claim about world peace under Trump is false, too. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021. US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa\u2019s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico\u2019s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021. Americans\u2019 incomes  While attacking President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, the video featured on-screen text that said,\u00a0\u201cU.S. incomes fall for third straight year,\u201d attributing those words to a Wall Street Journal\u00a0article\u00a0in 2023. An image of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was shown on screen at the same time. This combination of words and images is misleading. The video didn\u2019t acknowledge that the first of the three straight years in which the Wall Street Journal article reported that inflation-adjusted median household income went down\u00a0was 2020, when Trump was president.\u00a0(The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline.) Real median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Eric Trump\u2019s false claims about the economy and US global standing in 2016 Eric Trump told the crowd at the RNC Thursday that the \u201ceconomy was struggling, jobs were scarce\u201d and the US had poor standing on the global stage when his father was elected president in 2016. Facts First: Eric Trump\u2019s claims are false. When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he inherited a strong economy, including a robust labor market, and a nation that was viewed favorably on the global stage. In 2016, the US added an average of nearly 194,000 jobs per month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In the two years before, those average gains were even higher: 226,000 in 2015 and nearly 250,000 in 2014. Job gains remained above historical averages in 2017 through 2019, with 177,000 jobs added on average per month. Eric Trump\u2019s claims that jobs were scarce in 2016 were not accurate. In fact, the US labor market experienced its longest expansion on record starting in 2010 and continuing until March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic crippled global economies, including that of the US. In addition to inheriting a labor market in good shape, the economy was growing when Trump took office. Real gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic activity \u2013 typically grows between 2% and 3%, and it averaged 2.4% between 2014-2016 and then nearly 2.7% during the first three years of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. Also, the US was well regarded internationally when Barack Obama left office, and those sentiments plunged at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center. From CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace Pompeo\u2019s claim about the southern border under Trump Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that the US-Mexico border was \u201cclosed\u201d during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Facts First: Pompeo\u2019s claim is false.  While Trump tightened the border during his tenure, illegal crossings into the US from Mexico still numbered in the tens of thousands each month leading up to when he left office. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration limited non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border and prohibited migrants from crossing it in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. President Joe Biden later extended the restrictions. The former president\u2019s biggest effort to \u201cclose\u201d the border was met with resistance by federal courts, and the Supreme Court later gave Biden the green light to end the controversial \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy. From CNN\u2019s Devan Cole Trump makes false claims about election fraud in RNC video For the fourth straight night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use \u201cevery appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,\u201d including voting by mail.\u00a0Trump\u00a0relentlessly disparaged\u00a0mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has\u00a0continued to sharply criticize\u00a0it during the current campaign But Trump\u2019s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would \u201conce and for all secure our elections\u201d as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, \u201cWe never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.\u201d\u00a0And he said, \u201cKeep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it\u2019s the only thing they do well.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims are nonsense \u2013 slightly vaguer versions of his\u00a0usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and\u00a0stolen\u00a0and\u00a0that Democrats\u00a0are serial election cheaters.\u00a0The\u00a02020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump\u2019s opponents excel. The Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said\u00a0in a post-election November 2020 statement: \u201cThe November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d \u00a0From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Pompeo\u2019s false claim about spy balloons Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday evening that under former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, \u201cnot a single Chinese spy balloon flew across\u201d the US. \u201cWe\u2019d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,\u201d Pompeo said. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false. Three suspected Chinese spy balloons\u00a0transited over the continental US\u00a0during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u00a0said in 2023\u00a0that a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d allowed the balloons to travel undetected. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Linda McMahon\u2019s misleading claim on tariffs Linda McMahon, who served in the Trump administration as the Small Business Administrator, suggested at the Republican National Convention Thursday that China paid the tariffs that the former president put on roughly $300 billion of Chinese-made goods. \u201cInstead of taxing American companies, Donald Trump put tariffs on China that raised billions of dollars and protected American industries,\u201d she said. Facts First: This characterization of Trump\u2019s tariffs is misleading.  It\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s tariffs on China raised billions of dollars for the US government, but the duties were paid by US companies \u2013 not China. Study after study, including one from the federal government\u2019s bipartisan US International Trade Commission (USITC), has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese products. Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods \u2013 whether that\u2019s a retailer or a consumer. Many economists agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers. \u201cA tariff is just a form of a tax,\u201d Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN earlier this year. Tariffs can benefit some companies by raising the prices of competing foreign-made goods, but the duties can hurt other companies by raising component parts they need to manufacture. For example, Trump\u2019s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector \u2013 but that industry lost jobs. Federal Reserve economists\u00a0found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That\u2019s mostly because goods became more expensive to US consumers. Plus,\u00a0retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad. From CNN\u2019s Katie Lobosco RNC video featuring Reagan\u2019s voice misleadingly twists magazine article A video played on the final night of the Republican National Convention tried to attack President Joe Biden by featuring quotes from then-candidate Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous rhetorical questions about the President Jimmy Carter era at a presidential debate against Carter in 1980. At one point, the video featured Reagan\u2019s voice asking if, compared to four years ago,\u00a0\u201cIs America as respected throughout the world as it was?\u201d On-screen text answered the question with the words \u201callies no longer trust the United States,\u201d attributing them to a September 2021 article in Foreign Affairs magazine. Facts First: This quote is misleading. The article in Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t actually declare that allies no longer trust the United States. Rather, the article noted that \u201ccritics of President Joe Biden\u201d make the \u201cclaim\u201d that allies no longer trust the US after Biden\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2013 but the article then went on to argue that \u201cthese concerns about credibility are overblown.\u201d The convention video also featured Reagan\u2019s voice asking, \u201cIs there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?\u201d But if you go back precisely four years from the most recent unemployment rate, the answer is: less unemployment. The current unemployment rate is 4.1% for June 2024; four years prior, in June 2020, the unemployment rate was 11.0% amid the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a reasonable basis for this part of the video, though, if you interpret \u201cfour years ago\u201d more broadly to refer to any time in 2020. Before the pandemic, in the first two months of 2020, the unemployment rates were 3.6% and 3.5%.

{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_joe-biden-candidacy-in-peril", "text": "President Joe Biden is more isolated than he has ever been, with many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials now privately believing that he must abandon his campaign for a second term \u2013 and soon. \u201cThe next 72 hours are big,\u201d one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on much longer.\u201d In interviews with CNN, more than two dozen sources familiar with the dynamics inside the West Wing and campaign said there is now widespread acceptance that Biden remaining in the 2024 race is wholly untenable. \u201cEveryone is saying it privately,\u201d one senior Democrat said. \u201cPeople see and feel the walls closing in.\u201d Another top Democrat close to the White House described Biden as having become \u201cexceptionally insulated and isolated\u201d since the CNN presidential debate on June 27.\u00a0Multiple sources said some of the most senior advisers to Biden \u2013 including adviser Anita Dunn, attorney Bob Bauer and campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon \u2013 faced the ire of the president\u2019s family in the aftermath of the debate. That has only had the effect of making Biden\u2019s inner circle of advisers with free access to the president \u2013 which had already been famously small and impenetrable \u2013 even tighter. Three weeks after his disastrous debate performance that shocked even his closest aides, friends and Democrats across the party, a stunningly small number of his most loyal aides \u2013 chief among them, his decadeslong advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti \u2013 and members of the Biden family appear dug in along with the president. That tight circle has alarmed many Democrats who are questioning whether Biden is receiving realistic data about the plight of his candidacy. Deputy White House chief of staff Annie Tomasini, a longtime aide to the Bidens, joins Donilon and Ricchetti in forming a protective bubble around the president. Anthony Bernal, chief of staff to Jill Biden, has grown even more powerful during the deepening crisis and has tamped down any signs of dissent, two sources say, reporting any naysayers to the first lady. One person close to the inner circle of advisers said Tomasini plays no role in deciding who the president sees and speaks to. Ricchetti is more clear-eyed about the challenges facing Biden, two people familiar with the dynamic inside the West Wing said, largely because he remains the point person for lawmakers trying to send a message to the president. Amid a fury of speculation about Biden\u2019s future, senior-most West Wing advisers to Biden told CNN Thursday night that they have had no discussions among themselves \u2013 or with Biden \u2013 about him dropping out of the presidential race. In response to questions about this story, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is \u201cproud of the well-rounded team he has built.\u201d \u201cHe has not made changes to the group of advisers he consults, who he trusts because they\u2019ve demonstrated the integrity to tell the truth and keep the wellbeing of the American people front of mind,\u201d Bates said. Campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said, \u201cHere in HQ, we\u2019re working really hard because on winning campaigns, you work really hard.\u00a0There\u2019s an immense sense of pride across our office, because we know how important and critical that work we are doing here is for the fate of our democracy.\u201d Multiple sources also told CNN that the president\u2019s recent response to bad polls has been to cast doubt on whether there is anybody else who would perform stronger than him. Meanwhile, meetings and phone calls with anyone that might come bearing bad news appear to have paused. \u201cThe phones just kind of stopped ringing,\u201d is how one senior Democrat put it. CNN previously reported that in a tense conversation between former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Biden within the last week or so where the two disagreed over polling, Pelosi asked for Donilon,\u00a0a former pollster,\u00a0to join the phone call to go over the data.\u00a0A Pelosi spokesperson said Thursday the \u201cfeeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the speaker may have had with the president.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to hear from anyone. He wants to hear from Mike Donilon and Steve,\u201d one top Democrat close to the White House said. One person close to Biden\u2019s inner circle insisted that Donilon and Ricchetti have been presenting a range of views to Biden and that the president himself has been speaking directly with numerous party officials to hear their feedback. And in a meeting with top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, Biden aggressively challenged the notion that Jeffries\u2019 colleagues wanted him to step aside, according to a source briefed on the discussion. Unlike on Capitol Hill, where Democratic lawmakers have slowly begun to publicly voice their concerns \u2013 so far, 20 House Democrats have come out to call on Biden to drop out \u2013 White House and campaign aides have had little choice but to continue doing their day jobs. As Biden and his campaign aides continue to publicly insist that the president is not going anywhere, the mood in many corners of the White House and campaign has been of deep despair. \u201cThere is a lot of people who tell themselves \u2013 it is my job to do this,\u201d one Democrat close to the White House said. \u201cBut privately, they feel differently.\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks\u00a0on Thursday said the campaign is \u201cnot working through any scenarios\u201d where\u00a0Biden\u00a0is not the presidential nominee. \u201cOur campaign is not working through any scenarios where President\u00a0Biden\u00a0is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee,\u201d he said during a DNC news conference in Milwaukee. Biden\u2019s stunningly halting debate performance \u2013 and the downward spiral of his candidacy since \u2013 has sparked serious discontent inside the White House, with plenty of fingers pointed at senior advisers. Officials in and out of the administration have quietly questioned the intentions of those in the president\u2019s inner circle \u2013\u00a0and whether their choice to stay-the-course-at-all-costs stems from a fear of acknowledging they misread the situation or a desire to preserve their proximity to power. \u201cThis decision is not just about Biden,\u201d a former aide who had worked with Biden for decades told CNN. \u201cThere are other senior advisers who are considering whether they played the right role in this.\u201d The frustration with the president\u2019s advisers has permeated all levels of the White House as staff wrestles with a lack of information and decisions about their own professional future. \u201cStaff in general are just over the leadership here,\u201d one White House official said. Multiple former administration officials have told CNN that there has been an uptick in resumes on their desks in recent weeks, as their former colleagues are starting to look for an exit plan in the private sector. As Biden spent Thursday out of sight, recovering from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware, he has been described by those who have spoken to him as being \u201creceptive\u201d to arguments to step away from his reelection bid, a senior Democratic adviser told CNN. Biden is in a \u201ccontemplative stage\u201d as he isolates in Rehoboth Beach. A source familiar with the president\u2019s mindset\u00a0said\u00a0that he is \u201cthinking things through\u201d and \u201cdeliberating\u201d about how to proceed\u00a0with his reelection campaign\u00a0while he\u2019s in isolation. He has privately acknowledged to others that there is a limited path, given the all the unfavorable data, the source said. This source said it\u2019s unlikely the president will make any sort of announcement before the weekend and cautioned that anyone who thinks they know what Biden will ultimately do doesn\u2019t actually know. That makes it an open question \u2013 frustratingly so, in the eyes of many Democrats \u2013 whether Biden has come to any new decisions about his future. But even if he does heed the calls to step aside, a cascading series of events would be set into motion that officials would need time for which to prepare. Inside the White House, senior administration officials are bracing for Republicans to call for Biden to resign the presidency if he doesn\u2019t seek reelection. These arguments are one of the many complicating factors surrounding Biden\u2019s decision. With Biden\u2019s political future on the brink, the White House is fielding a steady stream of letters, telephone calls and message from Americans, too, from Democratic voters like Terri and John\u00a0Hale. \u201cIt\u2019s with utmost respect that we offer this conclusion \u2013 you cannot win this race,\u201d the Hales, retirees from Ankeny, Iowa, wrote in a letter to the White House obtained by CNN. \u201cNot because you are not the better man, but because the public \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 now sees your age and perceived limitations as the main issue in the campaign.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/joe-biden-candidacy-in-peril/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters", "text": "Which one of these candidates is facing calls from members of their own party to step aside in the presidential race: \u25ba Is it the recently convicted felon, also indicted for election interference and mishandling classified documents, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation as well as lying about his net worth to get loans tied to his massive real estate portfolio? \u25ba Or is it the incumbent president with a recent record of accomplishment in a bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a dubiously named piece of legislation that nonetheless addressed many of his party\u2019s priorities, like climate change? Both men are well into retirement age. Both ramble through answers to questions when they bother to take them. Both mix up names. Neither took part in debates during a primary season in which they racked up wins. And yet one of the men, former President Donald Trump, 78, has been able to remake the Republican Party around his own divisive persona. The other, President Joe Biden, 81, has now spent weeks defiantly defending his fitness for the job, slowly emerging from a protective bubble at the White House after a disastrous debate and spotty subsequent interviews. The next week will offer a fresh look at what must feel like a cruel dichotomy to Biden supporters. The GOP is now built around Trump When the Republican National Convention gets underway Monday, it will show off a speaking schedule full of far right personalities and an official party platform rewritten and simplified around Trump\u2019s priorities. Trump, between now and then, will pick a vice president from a short list of people who have previously criticized him but are now all in. In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination with insults about the size of Trump\u2019s hands, calling him a con man and arguing he couldn\u2019t be trusted with nuclear codes. Now Rubio is a Trump convert. So is Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who went from never-Trumper to true believer. Some Democrats are moving in an opposite direction. Longtime supporters now want Biden out of the race for fear he can\u2019t beat Trump, which\u00a0is\u00a0the one and only goal of Democrats afraid of his return to the White House. In any event, Rubio and Vance, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who are also reportedly on Trump\u2019s vice presidential short list, should be wary. His previous vice president, Mike Pence, is among the many people who served in Trump\u2019s first White House who have not endorsed Trump\u2019s latest election bid after an angry mob, inspired by Trump, stormed the Capitol with chants of \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Republicans had the opportunity to go a different direction. A CNN poll released back in February, before Trump had sealed the Republican presidential nomination, suggested his top Republican rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would fare much better in a head-to-head contest with Biden. Republican primary voters doubled down, decisively, on Trump. One of Haley\u2019s major policy proposals was a test for for older candidates like Biden and Trump, a prescient idea since Biden is now facing calls that he take a cognitive test and Trump has bragged that he could easily pass one. Still trying to convince fellow Democrats While Trump eyes a convention to celebrate his dominance next week, Biden is fighting back the argument that Democratic convention delegates should pick a younger successor next month. The latest in a series of public tests of Biden\u2019s abilities will be another interview with a network news anchor, NBC this time, broadcast in prime time on Monday. It\u2019s late in the election cycle for Democrats to be having this conversation, since the primary season has ended, their convention takes place next month and Trump is currently thought to have an advantage in key states heading into the November election. There are some indications Biden is regaining some support among key Democrats. While over a dozen lawmakers have called on him to drop out, with the number continuing to rise Friday, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime ally, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that the conversation about Biden\u2019s fitness needs to end before it hurts the party. \u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 with Biden,\u201d Clyburn said. If Biden dropped out, Clyburn said he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Progressives lawmakers, people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent \u2013 not Biden\u2019s natural allies on the policy front \u2013 are also standing up for Biden, arguing the party should rally around him and mobilize for November. Biden, meanwhile, despite the majority of polling that suggests he trails Trump in key states likely to decide the election, said at a rare news conference Thursday that he hasn\u2019t been shown polling data that suggests he would lose in November. The fact that he said polling data could theoretically convince him to leave the race is an adjustment from last week, when he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d could sway him. A bridge no more Biden also said at the news conference that he had changed his mind about a 2020 pledge to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between his older generation of lawmakers and and a new generation of leaders. \u201cWhat I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom and know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\u201d he said. Convinced he can beat Trump Biden also clearly believes that he is still the best person to beat Trump \u2013 the motivating principle for any Democrat these days \u2013 and Biden has been shocked during his presidency at the staying power of Trump and the MAGA turn of the GOP. \u201cHe thought it would be in the rearview mirror by now,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a recent book about Biden\u2019s presidency, \u201cThe Fight of His Life,\u201d speaking to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was necessarily planning to be a two-term president, but now that Trump is the alternative, Joe Biden really believes in his bones that he\u2019s the guy to beat him,\u201d Whipple said. In an odd twist, then, the thing keeping Biden in the race may be the very thing that has caused other Democrats to call for him to drop out.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_allen-weisselberg-released", "text": "Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was released from jail after serving 100 days for lying during an investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s real estate business. Weisselberg, the former right-hand man to Trump, was released Friday, according to New York City\u2019s Department of Corrections website and confirmed by a person familiar with the matter. He pleaded guilty earlier this year to two counts of perjury for lying during the New York attorney general\u2019s investigation into the Trump Organization\u2019s finances. As part of a plea deal with the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office he received a sentence of five months, but with time off for good behavior he served 100 days at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail. It was the second guilty plea for Trump\u2019s long time money man, who never turned against the former president despite pressure from numerous criminal investigations. Weisselberg previously served 100 days after he pleaded guilty to engaging in a decade-long tax fraud scheme. He left the Trump Organization under a severance agreement after his first guilty plea.

{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_joe-biden-health-and-age-scrutiny", "text": "As President Joe Biden isolates at his Delaware beach home after testing positive for Covid-19, he is growing increasingly\u00a0isolated from many corners of his Democratic Party as he faces deepening questions about whether he should continue his reelection campaign. The announcement of Biden\u2019s positive test on Wednesday came as calls from his party for him to step aside in the 2024 race are growing louder.\u00a0CNN reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told the president that polling shows Biden cannot defeat former President Donald Trump in November and that continuing his run for the presidency could destroy Democrats\u2019 chance to take back the House. Following Biden\u2019s campaign-changing performance in last month\u2019s presidential debate, his age and health \u2014 which have long been his biggest political weakness, dating back to his third run for the presidency starting in 2019 \u2014 have been under the microscope. In the last week, multiple incidents have been held up as signs that Biden is not sharp enough to convince voters that he could defeat Trump, let alone serve another four years as commander-in-chief. An interview with BET that taped on Tuesday and aired in full late Wednesday night is the latest moment that\u2019s being scrutinized by nervous Democrats. In that interview, Biden said that only a \u201cmedical condition\u201d would convince him to leave the race \u2014 a statement made just one day before he tested positive for Covid. He stumbled while referring to Black members of his administration, describing Lloyd Austin as the secretary of defense rather than saying his name. \u201cFor example, look at the heat I\u2019m getting because I named a, uh \u2026 the \u2014 secretary of defense, a Black man. I named Ketanji Brown, because of the people I\u2019ve named,\u201d Biden said, also referring to Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, whom he appointed to the high court. The White House said Wednesday the president had \u201cupper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general malaise\u201d as a result of his Covid infection. Video of the president leaving Las Vegas showed him slowly walking up the steps to enter Air Force One, including pausing on the second step to gather himself before continuing into the plane. Biden on Thursday is experiencing \u201cmild upper respiratory symptoms\u201d and is continuing to receive Paxlovid, according to a note from his physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor. O\u2019Connor notes that Biden does not have a fever and his vitals remain \u201cnormal.\u201d Additional video shot by pool reporters who met Biden in Delaware late Wednesday also shows the president appearing to have difficulty getting situated in his SUV for the drive to his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home, where he is planning to isolate. The video shows Biden taking half a minute to get into the SUV and requiring the assistance of Secret Service agents to get situated in the car. The president was not wearing a face mask while he was interacting with the agents, despite having Covid.\u00a0He eventually did put on a mask. Earlier on Wednesday, while visiting a local restaurant, the president appeared to mistake Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford for the state\u2019s governor. While speaking to a guest, Biden pointed to Ford and asked, \u201cYou know the gov?\u201d Individuals nearby laughed at the statement, but it was unclear whether Biden was joking. CNN has reached out to the Biden campaign and White House for comment on the moment in Nevada and the president\u2019s arrival in Delaware. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks\u00a0on Thursday said the campaign is \u201cnot working through any scenarios\u201d where Biden is not the presidential nominee. \u201cThe vice president is a part of the Biden-Harris ticket. Our campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee,\u201d he said during a DNC news conference in Milwaukee when asked if the campaign was working on any plans should Vice President Kamala Harris take the lead. Asked if Biden\u2019s receptive to conversations about leaving the race, Fulks replied, \u201cThe president has said it several times, he\u2019s staying in this race.\u201d \u201cThe president is in this race. He\u2019s going to and we look forward to him accepting the delegates in Chicago and continuing with this race to talk about what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he added. Polling shows a problem As calls for Biden to reconsider his candidacy are poised to grow even louder on Thursday, some of the reasons why are coming into sharper focus: Not only is Biden falling short to Trump, but Democratic candidates are afraid voters could see their own defenses of Biden as dishonest. \u201cDefending Biden\u2019s fitness for office is an untenable position for down-ballot Democrats,\u201d\u00a0according to a memo a leading Democratic research firm released Wednesday. It details that voters are\u00a0\u201clikely to see other Democrats\u2019 defense of him as fit as dishonest\u201d\u00a0by a wide margin. CNN obtained a polling memo from Blue Rose Research, which is distributed daily to operatives and officials across the Democratic Party. Pelosi is among those who pore over the details and findings in documents like this that are rarely shared. The memo dated Wednesday shines a brighter light on the reasons behind the calls for Biden to step aside. \u201cConcerns about President Biden\u2019s fitness for office are pervasive,\u201d\u00a0the memo says, pointing to polling data that shows a remarkable low number of voters \u2014 even those who supported Biden in 2020 \u2014 who believe he is capable of serving a second term. While partisan polling does not meet CNN standards, the 16-page document has value because it offers a window into the panic and alarm across the Democratic Party. An AP-NORC poll released Wednesday found 14% of all Americans are extremely or very confident that Biden has the \u201cmental capacity to be an effective president.\u201d Among Democrats, that number is 27%. The internal polling data shows an expanding battleground in the presidential race, with New Hampshire, Minnesota, New Mexico, Virginia and Maine becoming highly competitive in the race between Biden and Trump, in addition to the seven current top battleground states. Worrying moments for Democrats The president has had several moments over the last week that have worried Democrats even more about whether he can effectively continue to campaign. On July 11, the president had back-to-back slip-ups on the\u00a0last day of the NATO summit\u00a0in Washington, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d before correcting himself at one event and then referring to Harris as \u201cVice President Trump\u201d in a press conference, a mistake he did not correct or acknowledge. In that same press conference, Biden also appeared to back away from his previous assertion that only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could convince him to leave the race, saying he would not leave the race \u201cunless they came back and said there\u2019s no way you can win.\u201d Several calls with key groups of lawmakers on Friday and Saturday also did not seem to convince skeptical lawmakers that Biden was able to win. CNN reported Wednesday night that a Democratic lawmaker told\u00a0CNN\u00a0that\u00a0Biden\u2019s full court press in recent days following Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt on Trump has only exacerbated the panic inside the party. \u201cGetting worse\u201d is how the member put it. Another House Democrat who watched\u00a0Biden\u2019s\u00a0interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt\u00a0on Monday described feeling \u201cprofound sadness watching an admirable man tread water instead of leading us through it.\u201d While the assassination attempt on Trump eased the political pressure on Biden for a few days,  that pressure has kicked up again over the last several days as CNN\u00a0and others reported that some\u00a0Biden\u00a0allies were making a quiet push for the Democratic National Committee to speed up\u00a0Biden\u2019s virtual nomination process \u2014 with the hope of beginning the roll call vote as soon as next week. Concerned Democrats bought themselves a little more time by convincing the DNC to not move up the timeline \u2014 voting will not begin before August 1,\u00a0CNN\u00a0reported. The delay stopped a draft letter circulating among House Democrats that, if made formal, would have exposed further cracks in the party.\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer both pushed the DNC to delay the process, multiple sources told\u00a0CNN. Behind the scenes, the president is not as defiant as he is in public,\u00a0multiple Democratic sources told CNN. \u201cThe private conversations with the Hill\u00a0are continuing,\u201d\u00a0a\u00a0senior Democratic\u00a0adviser told CNN, speaking on condition of\u00a0anonymity to\u00a0avoid\u00a0alienating the campaign\u00a0and the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s being receptive. Not\u00a0as defiant\u00a0as he is publicly.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala\u00a0can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win?\u2019\u201c the\u00a0adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019s going to land but seems to be listening.\u201d The Biden campaign, which is also facing a growing outcry from Democratic donors, dismissed the suggestion the president was rethinking his candidacy. \u201cIf the facts matter \u2014 and they should \u2014 here is one: President Biden is the Democratic nominee and he is going to win this November,\u201d Kevin Munoz, a Biden spokesman, told CNN. Biden on defense Biden has been growing increasingly defensive over his political standing in recent days. CNN has reported that calls over the weekend with groups of Democratic lawmakers did not go well when the president was confronted with polling data that lawmakers said showed his standing in the race had fallen dramatically. On Wednesday night, CNN reported Pelosi had told Biden within the last week that the polling data showed he could not win reelection. The president responded by pushing back, telling\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0he has seen polls that indicate he can win, one source said. Another one of the sources described Biden as getting defensive about the polls. None of the sources indicated whether\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0told Biden in this conversation that she believes the president should drop out of the 2024 race. When asked for comment, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates did not respond to the details of\u00a0CNN\u2019s reporting on the recent\u00a0Pelosi-Biden call. \u201cPresident Biden is the nominee of the party. He plans to win and looks forward to working with congressional Democrats to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families,\u201d Bates said.

The\u00a0call between the\u00a0two leaders, who have had\u00a0a\u00a0complicated relationship, marks\u00a0their first conversation since Trump left the White House\u00a0and comes the day after he formally accepted the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for president. It\u00a0also comes\u00a0amid\u00a0concerns in Europe\u00a0about what Trump\u2019s policy toward\u00a0the\u00a0Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win the presidential election in November. \u201cPresident Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I had a very good phone call earlier today. He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States,\u201d\u00a0Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\u00a0\u201cHe condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.\u201d Trump continued, \u201cI appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.\u201d In a post on X describing the call, Zelensky said he congratulated Trump on his nomination and condemned the \u201cshocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\u201d \u201cI wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation\u2019s freedom and independence.\u201d Zelensky concluded, \u201cWe agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the Ukraine war in a day, but it remains unclear how he would pursue peace. In\u00a0last month\u2019s CNN\u00a0presidential\u00a0debate, Trump said that Putin\u2019s terms for an agreement \u2013 which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia \u2013 are \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d But the former president and his allies have also criticized\u00a0sending\u00a0US military aid to Kyiv. But the former president and his allies have also criticized US military aid to Kyiv. Trump has long been\u00a0critical of NATO defense spending. In February, the former president said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO member country that doesn\u2019t meet spending guidelines on defense, alarming many leaders in Washington and\u00a0Europe. Trump and Zelensky also have their own history. Nearly five years ago,\u00a0Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter,\u00a0on a call\u00a0ahead of the 2020 election. That \u201cperfect phone call,\u201d in Trump\u2019s words, led to\u00a0his\u00a0first impeachment. European diplomats have been preparing\u00a0for Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House, CNN previously reported, working to set up guard rails for NATO and trying to ensure lasting support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Last week, when Zelensky was in the US, he said that\u00a0\u201ceveryone is waiting for November,\u201d including Putin.\u00a0He also said that Biden and Trump are \u201cvery different\u201d but both support democracy, which is why he claimed: \u201cI think Putin will hate both of them.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night three of the Republican National Convention included former President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and other speakers who made false and misleading claims throughout the night. Here is a list of fact checks from CNN\u2019s Facts First team. Vance\u2019s misleading claim about Trump and the invasion of Iraq Former President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for vice president, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, insinuated in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that Trump had opposed the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Vance said that \u201cwhen I was a senior in high school, that same Joe Biden supported the disastrous invasion of Iraq.\u201d After mentioning other past Biden positions as well, Vance said, \u201cSomehow, a real estate developer from New York City by the name of Donald J. Trump was right on all of these issues while Biden was wrong. President Trump knew, even then, that we needed leaders who would put America first.\u201d Facts First: Vance\u2019s claim is misleading. In reality, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq before it occurred. When radio host Howard Stern asked Trump in September 2002 whether he is \u201cfor invading Iraq,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d In his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump argued a military strike on Iraq might be necessary. And Trump did not express a firm opinion about the looming war in a Fox interview in January 2003, saying that \u201ceither you attack or don\u2019t attack\u201d and that then-President George W. Bush \u201chas either got to do something or not do something, perhaps.\u201d Trump began criticizing the war in 2003, after the invasion, and also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq.He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004, the year before Biden did. But Vance suggested Trump had been right on the invasion itself while Biden got it wrong, and there\u2019s no basis for the claim that they were on opposing sides of the issue. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Kimberly Guilfoyle claims that \u2018Trump handed Biden a booming economy\u2019 Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and former Fox News host, slammed Biden for his handling of the economy in her speech on the third night of the Republican National Convention. \u201cPresident Trump handed Biden a booming economy and a strong nation. All Joe had to do was leave it alone and take a nap,\u201d she said Wednesday. Facts First: Guilfoyle\u2019s comments are misleading. While the economy did well during the first three years of the Trump administration, it was upended by the Covid-19 pandemic. While it had recovered somewhat by the end of 2020, there were still multiple weak points heading into 2021, when Biden took office. The US economy grew at an annualized and seasonally adjusted rate of 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020. That would usually be a great rate, but it didn\u2019t make up for a weak first quarter and terrible second quarter spurred by the pandemic. For all of 2020, the GDP fell 3.5% from the prior year, the worst decline since 1946. Also, disposable incomes fell by 9.5% on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the unemployment rate was 6.7% in December of that year. The US economy shed 140,000 jobs that month \u2014 a far worse outcome than economists predicted at the time. Covid-19 infections had increased that month, prompting some states to take additional containment measures. Trump was the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered, largely because of the pandemic. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby RNC video makes outdated claim about US wages A video that played before Vance\u2019s speech\u00a0hit Biden over his handling of the economy. \u201cUnder Biden, wages are going down while prices skyrocket,\u201d the video said. Facts first: The claim in the video is outdated. While inflation outpaced wages during the first half of the Biden administration, that reversed in the middle of last year. Inflation rose sharply during the early years of the Biden administration but has since slowed to an annual rate of 3% in June. In fact, prices fell in June for the first time since the start of the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, real average hourly earnings \u2013 which takes inflation into account \u2013 began increasing in mid-2023. They rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis, from June 2023 to June 2024, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about the 2020 economy Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley said in his opening remarks at the party convention on Wednesday: \u201cOur economy is not nearly as strong as it was four years ago.\u201d Facts First: This is false.Four years ago, in mid-2020, the US economy was in dire straits because of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, the June 2020 unemployment rate was 11%, well over double the June 2024 rate of 4.1%. In late July 2020, the federal government announced that the US economy had just experienced its worst contraction on record \u2013 shrinking by an annual rate of 32.9% in the quarter running from April 2020 through June 2020. We give politicians wide latitude to express opinions, and many Trump supporters have argued that the pre-pandemic economy under former Trump, in 2019 and prior, was stronger than the current Biden-era economy. That\u2019s a matter of subjective debate. But it\u2019s plainly inaccurate that the mid-2020 economy was superior to the current economy. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Newt Gingrich on the war in Afghanistan under Trump Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich claimed that \u201cPresident Trump orchestrated an orderly end to the Afghanistan war with no American killed in nearly two years.\u201d Facts first: Both of these claims are false. Although Trump oversaw a deal with the Taliban aimed at the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the war did not end under his presidency. The last US troops left Afghanistan in August 2021 under the Biden administration. Moreover, there is no period of \u201cnearly two years\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency where no American service member was killed. During his four years in office, there were 45 US service member hostile deaths, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System. The longest stretch without combat deaths was at the end of his presidency, from March 2020 until he left office in January 2021 \u2013 less than a year. From CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler Former Trump intel chief misleadingly says \u2018Taliban is back\u2019 Richard Grenell, who served as the acting Director of National Intelligence in 2020, said Wednesday night that under President Joe Biden \u201cthe Taliban is back.\u201d \u201c[A]fter four years of Joe Biden, wars are back, the Taliban is back and members of ISIS have slipped through America\u2019s broken southern border,\u201d Grenell said. Facts first: The claim that the \u201cTaliban is back\u201d is misleading, as\u00a0it insinuates the Taliban ever left.  While it\u2019s true that the Taliban returned to power after the United States\u2019 2021 withdrawal, the Taliban remained present in Afghanistan throughout Trump\u2019s time in office. The US, under the Trump administration, and the Taliban signed a historic agreement in 2020 that set into motion the US\u2019 withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Officials within the Trump administration also met with Taliban representatives \u201crepeatedly\u201d in Doha for nearly a year, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said in a 2019 report. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Peter Navarro\u2019s false claims about his prosecution for contempt of Congress The same day he got out of prison after serving his sentence for contempt of Congress, former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol demanded he break the law. \u201cThey demanded that I break the law because they have no respect for it. I refused,\u201d Navarro told the audience at the Republic National Convention Wednesday, adding that the committee wanted him to betray Trump. Navarro also claimed that special counsel Jack Smith \u201cindicted and prosecuted me.\u201d Facts first: These assertions are both false. While Navarro has long claimed that the information subpoenaed by the committee was protected by executive privilege, the judge presiding over his case found evidence did not show that Trump had formally asserted the privilege. And Smith did not prosecute Navarro; the US attorney in Washington, DC, did. In a ruling last summer, prior to his trial where a jury convicted Navarro of being in contempt of Congress, US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Navarro could not argue that Trump asserted executive privilege to shield him from the congressional subpoena. Mehta concluded that either Trump himself or someone authorized to assert privilege or immunity on his behalf would have had to personally invoke the privilege for it to be validly asserted. The judge said Navarro had not put forward adequate evidence to show such an assertion when he was subpoenaed for testimony and documents by the House committee in February 2022. A jury in Washington, DC, found that Navarro broke the law in refusing to comply with Congress, not the other way around as the former adviser suggested. From CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand Florida Republican\u2019s false claim about electric tanks Florida Rep. Mike Waltz said Wednesday that Biden is \u201cfocused on building electric tanks.\u201d \u201cWhat do we have today with President Biden? What\u2019s he focused on? \u2026 here\u2019s my favorite, he\u2019s focused on building electric tanks. Has anyone seen any charging stations in the Middle East for Biden\u2019s electric tanks?\u201d Facts first: The claim that Biden is focused on building electric tanks is false.  The Army released a climate strategy in 2022 that called for a move toward various kinds of electric vehicles, including \u201cfully electric tactical vehicles by 2050,\u201d but that would not include tanks. And, regardless, a strategy is not a mandate. An engineer with the RAND Corporation told FactCheck.org of similar claims made by Trump regarding electric tanks in the military: \u201cWhile it may be true that an electric tank would have limited range, the Army is not planning on fielding or deploying an electric tank, though there have been prototypes of\u00a0hybrid tanks.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Florida lawmaker\u2019s claim about extremism training in the military Florida Rep. Brian Mast claimed at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday that the Biden administration has distracted the military \u201cwith millions of hours of so-called extremism training.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have once again weakened our armed forces and \u2026distracted our troops with millions of hours of so-called extremism training,\u201d Mast said. Facts first: The claim that the US military has \u201cmillions of hours\u201d of extremism training is false.  While there has been training in the military on extremism, it is not millions of hours\u2019 worth. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered units in 2021 to hold a one-day \u201cstand down\u201d to discuss extremism in the military. The undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness said in a 2022 memo that \u201cdiscussions about extremist activity\u201d would be included in \u201cperiodic training.\u201d But the Biden administration has also shown an unwillingness to require more training on extremism in the military. In 2021, the White House said that while the administration \u201cshares the goal of preventing prohibited extremist activities and holding offenders accountable,\u201d it would not support the establishment of an Office of Countering Extremism in the Pentagon \u201cbecause it would impose onerous and overly specific training.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Burgum claims Biden has waged a \u2018war on energy\u2019 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum claimed Wednesday night as he addressed the Republican National Convention that Biden has waged a \u201cwar on energy.\u201d Facts First: This claim needs context. Biden has stressed the importance of renewable energy during his administration, but the US under Biden is producing more crude oil than any country ever has. The world record was set by the US in 2023, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, averaging about 12.9 million barrels per day \u2013 exceeding the Trump-era record, an average of about 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019. US production of dry natural gas also hit a new high in 2023.\u00a0So did US crude oil exports. CNN\u2019s Matt Egan reported in December that the US was exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia were producing, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. None of this is to say that Biden is the reason that domestic oil production has increased; market factors are the key driver of companies\u2019 investment and production decisions, and the Energy Information Administration has credited technological improvements in fracking and horizontal drilling technology that have made oil wells more productive. Egan reported in August: \u201cThe American Petroleum Institute, an oil trade group that has been critical of the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory efforts, noted that approved federal permits and new federal acres leased have both fallen sharply under Biden.\u201d Still, despite Biden\u2019s often-critical rhetoric about fossil fuel companies, some policy moves to get tougher on those companies and his major investments in initiatives to fight climate change, he certainly has not come close to stopping fossil fuel production as Trump has claimed. Biden has also approved some significant and controversial fossil fuel projects, including the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Ronny Jackson\u2019s false claim of \u2018record-high inflation\u2019 Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas claimed in his Republican National Convention speech on Wednesday that there has been \u201crecord-high inflation\u201d under the Biden administration. Facts First: This is false. The record for US inflation, set in 1920, is 23.7%; the Biden-era peak was 9.1% in June 2022. Jackson could fairly say there was a four-decade high under Biden \u2013 that June 2022 figure was the highest since late 1981 \u2013 but there was nothing close to a new record. In addition, Jackson didn\u2019t mention that inflation has fallen sharply since the Biden-era peak two years ago. The current inflation rate, for June 2024, is 3%. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Mike Waltz\u2019s false claim about spy balloons Republican Rep. Mike Waltz said Wednesday that there were no spy balloon incidents during the Trump administration, like the Chinese spy balloon that transited over the continental US in 2023 before being shot down over the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cWe had a president who defeated ISIS, broke Iran, stood with Israel, always stood with our allies, made China pay. You didn\u2019t see any spy balloons under President Trump, did you?\u201d Waltz said. Facts first: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.  Three suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a \u201cdomain awareness gap\u201d allowed the balloons to travel undetected. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about Russia\u2019s nuclear missiles near Cuba Whatley claimed in his opening speech on Wednesday evening that Russia has \u201cparked a nuclear missile capable boat\u201d in Cuba. \u201cWhere are we today? Russia has invaded Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve parked a nuclear missile capable boat 90 miles off our shore in Havana, Cuba.\u201d Facts first: This claim about the status of a Russian boat is false. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left.  A group of four Russian Navy vessels arrived in Cuba on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, was the first of the vessels to leave Havana on June 17. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC video falsely claims there was peace in the Middle East under Trump A video played early in the Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday night claimed that the \u201cstrength\u201d of Trump kept \u201cthe Middle East at peace.\u201d Whatley had similarly claimed in his convention speech on Monday that the Middle East was \u201cat peace\u201d four years ago under Trump. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there was peace in the Middle East under Trump is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Miller called \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites right-wing think tank without mentioning it was doing so A video played at the beginning of Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday evening attacked Biden\u2019s handling of foreign policy \u2013 and featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Defense News reports today that the US military is in decline and threats from China are formidable.\u201d Facts First: This claim is misleading. Defense News, an independent publication covering national security, did not itself assert that the US military is in decline. Rather, the publication reported that the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank had made that assertion. A Defense News article in October 2022 was headlined, \u201cUS military in decline, threats from China \u2018formidable,\u2019 report says.\u201d\u00a0The article explained that these assertions came from \u201ca new\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that each year analyzes the strength of the armed forces and the threats to America.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Spencer Cox on Friday pledged his support to former President Donald Trump in a notable shift after telling CNN last week he would not vote for Trump in November and hadn\u2019t voted for him in 2016 or 2020. Cox told Trump in a letter he posted on X that God \u201chad a hand in saving you,\u201d after the attempt on the former president\u2019s life at his Pennsylvania rally last weekend. \u201cYour life was spared. Now, because of that miracle, you have the opportunity to do something that no other person on earth can do right now: unify and save our country,\u201d he wrote. Cox\u2019s vow to do his \u201cbest to help and support\u201d Trump comes the day after the former president formally accepted the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for a third consecutive election, further cementing his hold on and vision for the party. It marks a departure from his previous criticism of the former president. Cox told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins last week on \u201cThe Source\u201d that he would not vote\u00a0for either presidential candidate this year, noting Trump\u2019s role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol as a concern. He had not voted for the top of the GOP ticket since 2012, Cox told Collins. In his letter, Cox said he was impressed with the statements Trump and former first lady Melania Trump made following the assassination attempt, saying that \u201cthere was strength in those words, and also humility. It was a side of you most of us have not seen, and it gave so many of us tremendous hope for the future of our country.\u201d The governor noted differences between himself and his party\u2019s nominee, writing: \u201cMr. President, I know we have some differences and you probably don\u2019t like me much. And that\u2019s OK. I get it. I\u2019m not writing this letter looking for a position in your Cabinet or a role on your team. But I have loved so many of your policies and firmly believe that our country has suffered over the last four years due to a lack of leadership and is in desperate need of change.\u201d Trump, he wrote, has \u201ca chance to build a coalition of support that our country has not seen since Ronald Reagan.\u201d \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to compromise on a single conservative policy in order to do it. By treating President Biden with basic human dignity and respect and by emphasizing unity rather than hate, you will win this election by an historic margin and become one of our nation\u2019s most transformational leaders,\u201d Cox said. He continued, \u201cBy extending an olive branch to voters who are open to persuasion and ignoring the extremists, you can solidify a legacy as one of the most important presidents in our nation\u2019s 250-year history. You can make your success, in leading our country to a new era of peace, unity, and prosperity, the greatest way to silence your critics.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/utah-gov-spencer-cox-trump-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_politics_hunter-biden-aileen-cannon-donald-trump-special-counsel", "text": "Hunter Biden on Thursday asked judges to throw out his gun convictions and dismiss his pending tax charges, citing the\u00a0controversial recent ruling\u00a0from Judge Aileen Cannon that ended the classified documents case against Donald Trump and threw into question the validity of special counsels like the one prosecuting the president\u2019s son. Lawyers representing President Joe Biden\u2019s son filed the separate motions in federal courts in Delaware, where he was\u00a0convicted last month\u00a0of three felony gun offenses, and in California, where he\u2019s expected to go on trial this fall for nine\u00a0alleged tax crimes. This is the latest fallout from Cannon\u2019s shock ruling, which found that the Justice Department special counsel who prosecuted Trump was unconstitutionally appointed and unlawfully funded. That special counsel, Jack Smith, is\u00a0appealing the decision. A separate special counsel, David Weiss, has been investigating Hunter Biden since 2018 and brought the separate gun and tax indictments against him last year. Biden denies wrongdoing in both matters and\u00a0claims\u00a0he\u2019s being politically targeted. In court filings Thursday, Biden said Weiss was pursuing \u201can unauthorized prosecution\u201d and that his gun convictions were \u201ca miscarriage of justice.\u201d For the tax charges, he demanded the same treatment as Trump, whose case was dismissed. \u201cThe defect has been recognized and used to invalidate an indictment brought by the Special Counsel against former President Trump, the equivalent result should be available to Mr. Biden,\u201d Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote regarding his tax indictment. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed\u00a0Weiss\u00a0and\u00a0Smith\u00a0as special counsels under a process that has been repeatedly challenged in court and deemed proper by federal judges across the country, until Cannon\u2019s ruling Monday. In fact, Hunter Biden\u00a0tried but failed\u00a0to get the gun and tax cases thrown out based on similar arguments. Reviving those arguments, Hunter Biden cited momentum from Trump-appointee Cannon and conservative Supreme Court Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas. Ironically, while Hunter Biden champions their rulings, many of his father\u2019s allies have condemned them. \u201cThe Attorney General relied upon the exact same authority to appoint the Special Counsel in both the Trump and Biden matters, and both appointments are invalid for the same reason,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in court filings Thursday in the gun case. When the president\u2019s son previously raised similar arguments, Weiss\u2019 team said his theories were meritless and that their office was structured in legally sound fashion. A spokesperson for special counsel Smith said Monday that Cannon\u2019s decision \u201cdeviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue.\u201d Cannon\u2019s ruling was also quickly\u00a0picked up by Alexander Smirnov, an ex-FBI informant who was indicted by Weiss for allegedly peddling fabricated claims to the FBI about Ukrainian bribery schemes involving Joe and Hunter Biden. Smirnov\u2019s lawyers similarly cited Cannon as part of a new attempt to get his case tossed. He pleaded not guilty. At his gun trial, Hunter Biden was found guilty of buying and possessing a gun while\u00a0abusing illegal drugs. The\u00a0tax charges\u00a0are based on what Weiss called a \u201cfour-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million,\u201d from income from his foreign business deals.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/hunter-biden-aileen-cannon-donald-trump-special-counsel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_american-journalist-alsu-kurmasheva-held-russia", "text": "When Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was blocked from leaving Russia last June, her family never expected that she would still be in Russian detention more than a year later. \u201cWe were so confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets \u2026 in June or July \u2026 for August 2024,\u201d her husband, Pavel Butorin, told CNN. \u201cLittle did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.\u201d Kurmasheva, a longtime journalist for US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), had gone back to Russia to see her mother in May 2023. According to Butorin, when she attempted to leave Russia and return home to Prague in early June, she was briefly detained at the airport and her passports were taken. She was fined and placed under de facto \u2014 and then formal \u2014 house arrest for months. Then, in October 2023, while awaiting the return of her passports, Kurmasheva was arrested and charged by the Russian authorities, who claimed she was a foreign agent. They opened up another case against her in December, claiming that she had disseminated \u201cfake news\u201d about the Russian Army. Her family and her employer have denied these charges. Now, her family wants the US government to declare her wrongfully detained and treat her case with similar gravity to that of the other American journalist detained in Russia: Evan Gershkovich. A Russian court said Friday that Gershkovich, who has been declared wrongfully detained, was guilty of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison. The conviction and trial against Gershkovich were decried as a sham. Butorin, who spoke to CNN prior to Gershkovich\u2019s verdict, also denounced the Wall Street Journal reporter\u2019s detention and called for his immediate release. He expressed gratitude to the publication for raising the profile of Kurmasheva\u2019s case. However, he noted that there has been a \u201cdouble standard\u201d from the US in its wrongful detention designations. Gershkovich was given the designation, which empowers the government to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap, within two weeks of his arrest. Butorin said he has not heard a good answer from the government about why his wife has not also been given a designation, and instead regularly hears \u201ca set of talking points.\u201d \u201cIt was absolutely the right thing to do to designate Evan as wrongfully detained. He is wrongfully detained. I consider Alsu to be wrongfully detained,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, she was detained and now remains in detention because of her work for an American media organization and her American citizenship, and they made it clear to her in no uncertain terms back in October that this was the reason why she was being detained,\u201d Butorin said. \u201cEvery time a court considered extending her pre-trial detention, her American citizenship was cited and was the primary reason for not releasing her under house arrest, because they consider her a flight risk.\u201d On Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller urged Kurmasheva\u2019s \u201cswift release,\u201d but said he did not have \u201cany new information to provide about a wrongful detention determination.\u201d Another State Department spokesperson said they \u201care closely following the case of Alsu Kurmasheva, a dedicated journalist who is being targeted by Russian authorities for her uncompromising commitment to speaking the truth and her principled reporting.\u201d US officials have never been granted access to see\u00a0Kurmasheva, who is jailed in Kazan, a city in the Tatarstan region in southwest Russia. In late May, her pretrial detention was once again extended until early August. The family has also not been allowed phone calls to Kurmasheva. She has been able to see her mother a few times, Butorin said. He said that video of her in court shows that her imprisonment has taken a toll on her health. The ongoing separation has been incredibly hard for the family. Butorin and Kurmasheva have two daughters \u2014 Bibi, who just turned 16, and Miriam, who is 12. They say it has been \u201creally challenging\u201d being away from her. \u201cWe need our mom,\u201d Bibi told CNN. \u201cThese years of our lives are going by so quickly. It\u2019s crazy to know how much we\u2019ve grown up since she\u2019s been away.\u201d Butorin, Bibi, and Miriam described Kurmasheva as a kind and selfless person who was deeply involved in her community. \u201cShe really liked to spend time with us. She would always pick us up from school with snacks and we would play music in the car,\u201d like Swift and Olivia Rodrigo, Bibi said. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful that she\u2019s perceived as a criminal because that\u2019s not who she is at all,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/american-journalist-alsu-kurmasheva-held-russia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_inside-president-joe-bidens-campaign", "text": "Multiple leading Democrats tell CNN they feel caught in what one described as a \u201cdoom loop,\u201d with every move to keep\u00a0President Joe Biden in\u00a0or push him out further destroying their chances against Donald Trump. It\u2019s breaking the resolve of even staunch allies. It\u2019s feeding bad polls. It\u2019s turning off more donors. It\u2019s sustaining a media atmosphere where no matter what Biden does, he comes off looking like a failure. And for those who were hoping Biden would quit, the public and private pressure, several top Democrats worry, has been backfiring. \u201cHis last act will not be getting knocked down,\u201d said one longtime Biden 2020 campaign aide of the family and the inner circle. \u201cThey won\u2019t allow it.\u201d Even several Democrats who want Biden to go acknowledge they\u2019ve created a situation where he will never be able to satisfy the \u201ctests\u201d skeptics have said he must pass to stay their nominee.\u00a0They are buckling down harder,\u00a0especially when the\u00a0critiques are\u00a0more based on vibes, like when Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin suggested in a session between\u00a0top aides and Senate Democrats\u00a0last week to \u201cput him in a muscle shirt, like Reagan chopping wood,\u201d according to one person briefed on the discussion. CNN\u2019s conversations with two dozen Democratic officials, aides in the White House and the campaign reelection headquarters and supportive groups demonstrate just how dark and confused the situation has become\u00a0even with Trump\u2019s rambling and combative convention speech on Thursday night giving the Biden campaign glimmers of hope for the first time in weeks. Even among aides in the White House and Wilmington who for long after the debate were ready to stick with him, the weight has started to feel too much.\u00a0They loved saying in 2020 that Joe Biden won because the party decided, and not the pundits. Now it feels like the party has decided again, and the president is drawing out the pain,\u00a0damage to the party and embarrassment for himself with each hour. Some say they\u2019ll quit. Some have already \u201cquiet quit,\u201d going through the motions until Joe Biden gets to the end that\u00a0many of them now believe is inevitable. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a person who is off the record saying he should stay in,\u201d said one person who\u2019s been involved in several of the conversations. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense that it\u2019s game over,\u201d said a Biden aide. Faith in the Biden inner circle \u2013\u00a0smaller and tighter than ever despite\u00a0what they have been seeing on TV\u00a0or\u00a0hearing directly from top leaders in their own party \u2013 has been obliterated. Other senior political and government aides accuse them of delusion and catering to their own self-interest. Major donors are apoplectic. Many in the next rung of senior aides\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who might otherwise be spending time building out campaign operations\u00a0\u2013\u00a0have been emailing and texting to check in about how far down into despair they are day by day.\u00a0They\u2019re discussing\u00a0their refusal to put their own credibility on the line to make a case for\u00a0a\u00a0president that they can no longer see themselves. Crucially, they don\u2019t hear anyone making the case\u00a0to them. \u201cIt feels like if he could go to Chicago and get the delegates to vote for him now, he would. It feels like if he could go to Congress and make a rousing speech, he would,\u201d said one Democratic operative involved with the campaign. \u201cWhatever your job is, we\u2019re not getting the materials we need to be making the case we need to be making.\u201d Many tend to learn of existential information involving people who work just a few feet away by reading reporters\u2019 tweets. Trust is low. Calls from the outside are dodged. Multiple senior aides told CNN they worry about voicing the extent of their frustration or even asking questions lest they be tagged disloyal. Some tried to tap into that same righteous indignation that Biden is projecting at his own party.\u00a0Biden himself is holding firm \u2013\u00a0and\u00a0it\u2019s not just him. Top aides keep telling people they remain sure of his path to win, pointing out how close the election was in 2020, how similar they still believe the electorate will behave in rejecting Trump-style extremism and how those people who are suddenly panicking about his age or the polls were not being realistic about where they were pre-debate. \u201cHere in HQ, we\u2019re working really hard because on winning campaigns, you work really hard,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz. \u201cThere\u2019s an immense sense of pride across our office, because we know how important and critical that work we are doing here is for the fate of our democracy.\u201d Most leading Democrats agree that democracy is on the line, along with issues like mass deportation and ending climate protections \u2013 only intensifying the worry several Democratic officials said they had looking\u00a0at the Republican convention and see not just confidence, but happiness. They think forward to their own convention in Chicago in a month and dread a week that multiple high-level Biden supporters say right now feels like will be \u201ca funeral.\u201d Donors play their cards Fundraising\u00a0has\u00a0slowed significantly, though not as much as some have projected. Some involved believe the campaign could end the month millions short of its goal, with both grassroots online fundraising not where they expected it to be and big donors holding out, some of whom have been making a show of sending emails saying they are stopping checks to Biden and other Democrats unless he pulls out. Biden has never put much stock in donors, and that continues \u2013 especially because some of the most prominent names calling for a boycott, including Galaxy Digital LP founder Mike Novogratz and heiress Abigail Disney, had not given to Biden or the Democratic National Committee since 2020, and then only gave a total of $5,600 each. And if Biden doesn\u2019t drop out, several senior people on the campaign believe, many of the donors now saying they won\u2019t give will turn around if truly faced with the reality that the other option is rolling over to a Trump return. Two sources told CNN Thursday that furious donors are now telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside. \u201cYes, that card has been played,\u201d a senior House Democrat told CNN Thursday night. \u201cThey believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,\u201d said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to throw good money after bad.\u201d Democratic strategists are divided about how seriously to take that threat when Trump is the alternative, almost daring the rich donors to hold back if Biden stays with it. Still,\u00a0loyalist donors are swamped with emails from their counterparts, asking them to justify still backing the president. Unsure of what to say, with no guidance or talking points, some smaller groups have discussed brainstorming by shared documents on Google or group text chains. But multiple people in that smaller and smaller group are losing faith too. Sinking morale Morale has gotten bad enough that some are finger-pointing at each other.\u00a0In the White House, they look at the campaign and say that at least they are filling their time with official duties, like pushing ahead on policy and running the federal government. In Wilmington, they look at the West Wing and say that while aides there are bemoaning their lives in blind quotes for DC insider publications, they are busy in headquarters still trying to salvage the campaign. Still, what can come off like a groundswell\u00a0of calls for Biden to step aside\u00a0tends to be more haphazard in reality \u2013 and with Biden perceiving them differently than those outside do. While news of his blunt conversations with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only leaked in the last day, several people who know the president pointed out\u00a0that\u00a0Biden\u00a0was aware of what they said last week and barreled forward still. One House Democrat who thinks Biden should not run told CNN of days of phone calls that show congressional leaders more actively engaged, citing as proof the decision to push back the virtual roll call vote for Biden\u2019s nomination. People on the fence, the House Democrat said, \u201cQuestion their position and wonder what more can be done (without doing much themselves, of course\u2026.)\u201d Asked to describe the phone calls between members, the House Democrat said, \u201cIt\u2019s mostly talk and posturing and the meetings you\u2019ve heard about, from what I know.\u201d Biden campaign says the data is still there to claw back Even as more and more campaign aides acknowledge they could be days away from switching gears to working on the\u00a0Kamala Harris campaign,\u00a0some continue to make the case that this entire discussion remains overblown. They point to numbers like 1,455 people signing up for a single volunteer shift in Pennsylvania on one day in the last week, or 150% more volunteers in the week after the debate than the entire month of May. \u201cAll the quantitative and qualitative things you need to win a campaign, if the question is, \u2018Do we have it?\u2019 the answer is yes. I\u2019ve never seen such a disconnect between the numbers and the cable chatter,\u201d said Dan Kanninen, the campaign\u2019s battleground state director, in an interview on Thursday. Kanninen and campaign aides acknowledge that Biden\u2019s best path to victory is now just holding onto the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, but say they still believe that the backlash to Trump and aligned candidates for Senate and governor in Arizona and North Carolina makes those more in play than most outsiders are accounting for. They also believe that Biden\u2019s strength with some groups, including among seniors, will give him the ability to claw back from what they argue is likely to be Trump\u2019s high water mark post-convention \u2014 which still doesn\u2019t have him over 50% in nearly any poll of any battleground state. \u201cI feel strongly that based on the record, who he is, the broad coalition that he has assembled and kept makes him uniquely suited to win this election,\u201d Kanninen said. On many minds: how small the sliver of voters were that determined power in the last two elections. Despite Biden\u2019s 7 million vote win in the popular vote, just 44,000 votes between four states delivered him the Electoral College in 2020, and just 18,000 votes across races in 2022 were the difference between the current five-seat Republican majority and a five-seat Democratic majority in the House. To those still with Biden, that\u2019s an argument for not creating more chaos. To those who want him out and are imagining what a dirge over the next few months could do to voter enthusiasm, that\u2019s why he has to go. One House Democrat in a district that is not normally considered marginal described the level of worry about losing even that seat now as \u201cDEFCON 2.\u201d Aides insist that once they can get back to making the contrast against Trump, the polls will change, though several acknowledged that they don\u2019t know how that will possibly happen if Biden stays in the race. \u201cPeople are f**ing amped up about this election and they will vote for a dead guy over Donald Trump \u2013 that\u2019s how scared people are,\u201d said one top Democratic operative involved. In the meantime, Biden defenders argue that their party is full of people who are making a bad situation worse and worse. \u201cWhat comes to mind is my high school baseball coach constantly reminding us we\u2019re still in control of our own destiny. Keep your head in the game,\u201d said California Sen. Alex Padilla. \u201cAnybody who believes today that we\u2019re going to lose is absolutely wrong, but the only pathway for Democrats winning in November is for all of us to do our part.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/inside-president-joe-bidens-campaign/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_trump-haley-desantis-rnc-analysis", "text": "Once the leader was on his throne, the ritual capitulation could begin. Donald Trump looked on with an ethereal gaze Tuesday as a parade of Republican presidential candidates whose dreams he crushed staged a parade of the vanquished at the Republican National Convention. On another night awash in emotion after Trump escaped an assassination attempt just days before, speakers joined a choreographed attempt to soften his hardman image, portraying him as a caring and even benevolent, leader, boss and grandfather while smoothing the rougher edges of his populist and authoritarian worldview. The message on night two in Milwaukee was double-edged and impossible to miss: this is indisputably and irrevocably Trump\u2019s party now and the GOP is united in pursuit of victory. \u201cDonald Trump has my full endorsement, period,\u201d said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who warned during primary season that Trump would foment global and political chaos and who declared in February, \u201cI feel no need to kiss the ring.\u201d Her genuflection, which came shortly after Trump made another triumphant entrance into the arena, might have come through gritted teeth, but it closed off the unfinished business of an acrimonious primary race that saw the former UN ambassador win hundreds of thousands of votes long after her campaign ended. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis once billed himself as Trumpism without the pandemonium and as a potential president who could actually enact the MAGA agenda. But on Tuesday night, he implored the crowd, \u201cLet\u2019s make the 45th President of the United States the 47th President of the United States.\u201d DeSantis, whom Trump first saw as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and then a traitor, drew a rare guffaw from the ex-president at someone else\u2019s joke when he declared, \u201cAmerica cannot afford four more years of a \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 presidency,\u201d\u00a0referring to the 1989 dark comedy in which two employees pretend their dead boss is still alive. Many grassroots Republicans who backed Trump confided on this year\u2019s campaign trail that they saw the Florida governor as a potential successor \u2014 once the ex-president had moved on. But Trump watched Tuesday alongside his newly anointed MAGA heir apparent, vice presidential nominee JD Vance. The first, affectionate flush of their political infatuation was obvious and it laid bare the price DeSantis may pay for ignoring the maxim of Omar from \u201cThe Wire\u201d: \u201cYou come at the king, you best not miss.\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has spent years paying penance for his bitter 2016 primary fight with Trump, which has seen him swallow his fury at the ex-president\u2019s insults over his father and wife. He\u2019s long since dropped any hope that he can be a powerful political operator outside Trump\u2019s shadow. And he made sure many seconds did not elapse on Tuesday before roaring, \u201cGod Bless Donald J. Trump.\u201d The poetry of Trump\u2019s red-hatted followers In 2016, Trump obliterated Marco Rubio\u2019s hopes of a generational transformation of the Republican Party. The Florida senator was once a GOP hawk and orthodox conservative who backed comprehensive immigration reform in the mold of the GOP\u2019s spiritual leader before Trump, former President Ronald Reagan. But to remain politically viable, Rubio has undergone the reeducation in populist nationalism that anyone who wants a future in the GOP must endure. On Tuesday, he used his personal political heritage as a platform to lionize Trump for turning the GOP into a party for the working class, in a soaring speech that showcased the eloquence that once led pundits to put him on a fast track to the Oval Office.\u00a0Those ambitions clearly have not been fully sated \u2014 one possible reason why Trump passed him over for a spot as his vice presidential nominee. Rubio sought to imbue Trumpism and the millions of supporters who crowd into the ex-president\u2019s rallies with a kind of poetic nobility. \u201cFor those still wondering in the press and many watching at home, these, these are the Americans who wear the red hats and wait for hours under a blazing sun to hear Trump speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they want, what they ask for, it is not hateful or extreme.\u201d Rubio said these citizens just want the basics \u2013 good jobs, lower prices, secure borders and safety from criminals and terrorists. \u201cThere is absolutely nothing dangerous or anything divisive about putting Americans first.\u201d A mix of hero worship and personal ambition Tuesday\u2019s myth making came as no surprise. Trump has long cultivated a personality cult in the Republican Party. He demands total loyalty from subordinates and basks in public praise \u2014 as demonstrated in on-camera Cabinet meetings when officials lined up to laud him. His curated image of strength and bombast honed on the \u201cApprentice\u201d developed along lines that delighted his fans. But it horrifies many Americans since his grasps for unaccountable power often cross into demagoguery. His vows to use a second term to enact \u201cretribution\u201d could augur contentious days ahead, despite his pledge to forge national unity after narrowly avoiding death in a Pennsylvania park on Saturday afternoon. The idea of Trump as a superhuman leader has taken on a theocratic dimension since the attempt to kill him. Almost every speaker at the convention has argued that divine intervention spared the ex-president so he could be installed once again in the Oval Office on a mission of national salvation. As Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary and current governor of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, put it: \u201cNot even an assassin\u2019s bullet could stop him. God Almighty intervened because America is one nation under God and he\u2019s certainly not finished with President Trump.\u201d The idea that a greater force is at work is deeply felt by many delegates in Milwaukee amid an overwhelming sense that Trump has been divinely blessed. But as Trump sat alongside Vance overlooking the arena, it was also hard not to draw comparisons with the imagery of the Soviet Union, as a rotating MAGA politburo of officials and family members moved in and out of his balcony box and subordinates around him followed his every move \u2014 popping up out of their seats to join him in standing ovations and looking for cues as he pumped his fist. In bowing before Trump, his supplicants look to a distant future But Tuesday night was not exclusively about elevating Trump. His former foes had their self-interest at heart. Even Trump cannot go on forever. And on a distant day where the once and possibly future president has moved aside, there will be a GOP vacancy. Vance might have leapfrogged Trump\u2019s past rivals by snaring the vice-presidential nomination after an intense effort to impress his new ticket mate. But in any future contested fight for the Republican nomination, the approval of the Trump base will be paramount. By 2028, or whenever the next contested Republican race takes place, Rubio will be an elder statesman \u2014 far older than Vance, who\u2019s 39 and will be a heartbeat away from the presidency if the GOP ticket wins in November. Cruz may still have designs on the social and evangelical conservative sector of the GOP \u2014 which is critical to launching GOP presidential campaigns in Iowa. Huckabee Sanders could rival him for those voters. She\u2019s always been with Trump and figures to be a prominent female MAGA standard bearer in future presidential campaigns. Haley, who does well with the hawkish, internationalist wing of the party, will need to bolster her support with MAGA voters if she\u2019s to do better in a primary race in the coming years. After offering her endorsement of Trump, she effectively loaned Trump her voters \u2013 many of whom were repelled by the ex-president. \u201cThere are some Americans who don\u2019t agree with Donald Trump 100% of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to them is simple: You don\u2019t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him.\u201d Haley smartly stressed areas where she and traditional conservatives might agree with Trump \u2013 for instance, on a hardline policy that is pro-Israel and anti-Iran. But the most remarkable foreign policy content of her speech came when she sought to reframe the ex-president\u2019s frequent cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, is a devotee of the staunch US foreign policy creed of Reagan, whom Republicans once memorialized for winning the Cold War. But 40 years on, a Democrat, President Joe Biden, has assumed Reagan\u2019s\u00a0role of facing down Moscow\u2019s tyrant. So key GOP figures are whitewashing Trump\u2019s hero worship of Putin by suggesting that in office he wielded some kind of mystical inner strength that deterred the former KGB lieutenant colonel. \u201cPutin didn\u2019t attack Ukraine, because he knew Donald Trump was tough. A strong president doesn\u2019t start wars; a strong president prevents wars,\u201d Haley said. Her willingness to paper over her glaring foreign policy differences with Trump was another sign that the former South Carolina governor shares the reality of all the GOP presidential candidates Trump left in his wake. The only possible path to power in the future lies in homage to Trump now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/trump-haley-desantis-rnc-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_joe-biden-polling", "text": "Joe Biden just made a false statement about his current polling position. He told BET that \u201cpresidents who have won at this stage of the game, the last seven or eight presidents, five of them were losing at this time by significant margins.\u201d A look at history, however, shows no such thing. Instead, it reveals that Biden is in a weak position for an incumbent president, and incumbents who are trailing at this point in the campaign rarely come back to win. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether Biden was referring to sitting presidents (i.e., counting only races with incumbents) or future presidents (i.e., counting all presidential races). Either way, his statement doesn\u2019t hold water. Let\u2019s talk about incumbents first. I went back and looked at all available polling data from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research (from 1940 to 2020) and Gallup (for 1936). This includes 15 presidential races that featured incumbents. Just two incumbents (George W. Bush in 2004 and Harry Truman in 1948) were trailing by any margin at this point in the campaign and came back to win. That\u2019s a far cry from five of the last seven or eight presidents, as Biden put it to BET. Of the past eight incumbents who ran for reelection, five faced a deficit in the average of polls at this point. Four of them lost \u2014 Trump in 2020, George H.W. Bush in 1992, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Gerald Ford in 1976. Only George W. Bush was down at this stage in 2004 and went on to win. Incumbents such as Barack Obama in 2012, Bill Clinton in 1996 and Ronald Reagan in 1984 were all ahead by now. All would be reelected. Indeed, the track record for incumbents who were leading at this point in their campaigns is strong \u2014 and since 1936, all of them emerged victorious. Biden, though, may not just have been referring to incumbents. He may have been including future presidents too. Open races, in which the candidates are often less well known, tend to be more unpredictable. In this case, though, Biden\u2019s statement is still wrong. The candidate leading at this point in the campaign has won six of the past eight presidential elections. Trump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2004 were the exceptions. (Note: I\u2019m talking about winning the election, not the popular vote. Though if we\u2019re examining the popular vote, it would still remain six out of eight because while the 2016 polls at this point would have predicted the correct popular vote winner, the 2000 polls would not.) For the purposes of understanding the depth of Biden\u2019s problem, we can go back even further. Although Biden didn\u2019t say this himself, I was interested to see, going back to 1936, how often a candidate trailed by a significant margin just before the party conventions but went on to win. You can find others who were doing worse than Biden is right now and won. George H.W. Bush was losing in 1988 to Michael Dukakis. Richard Nixon was down to Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Add those to Trump in 2016 and Truman in 1948, and you get four examples of candidates who were trailing at this point by at least as much as Biden is currently and went on to win. Still, that\u2019s not the five Biden said, and we\u2019ve widened the sample size to more than double what he mentioned in his BET interview. You can get to five if you include George W. Bush, whose deficit in 2004 was not as bad as Biden\u2019s. Biden is behind by about 3 points or worse in the swing states, while Bush was down by 1 to 2 points nationally. A 5 out of 21 (23%) chance of victory isn\u2019t where an incumbent president wants to be right now. Lastly, I\u2019ll note that if we focus solely on races in which presidents were seeking reelection, we can see what Biden\u2019s real problem is. He\u2019s an incumbent with an approval rating south of 40% and a disapproval rating north of 50%. There have been other incumbents running for reelection with similarly bad numbers \u2014 Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992. Both lost, and not by small margins. Ironically, the best hope for Biden is the example of Trump, who was down at this point in 2020 by far more than Biden is now. Trump had an approval rating right at 40% (so not significantly better than Biden\u2019s current numbers) and a disapproval rating well above 50%. Trump ended up barely losing in the pivotal battleground states. Now this Trump example doesn\u2019t make Biden\u2019s remark about the polls to BET somehow true. No matter how you look at it, his statement is incorrect. Perhaps more worrisome is it\u2019s not the first time Biden has tried to diagnose his polling in public in a way that is at best misleading. He did so during his news conference last week, when he said, \u201cThere are at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now.\u201d While he seemed to give himself a little more wiggle room than he did in his BET interview, the idea he is trying to push \u2014 that plenty of people in his position have come back to win \u2014 is a constant theme. But it gives his supporters false hope. While I wouldn\u2019t consider his prospects dire \u2014 a Biden victory is possible \u2014 the president is in quite a bad place polling-wise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/joe-biden-polling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_trump-rnc-biden-2024-analysis", "text": "Thousands of supporters chanted \u201cfight, fight, fight\u201d and pumped their fists Thursday night as Donald Trump basked in the love of the new Republican Party he built and that hails him as a superhero touched by God. States away, Joe Biden sat isolated and sick in his Delaware beach house as the party he led to victory just four years ago turned on the 81-year-old president and the possibility grew that a humiliating final chapter may be opening in a storied political life. Trump and Biden have been locked in a bitter political clash ever since Biden vowed to launch a battle for the soul of the nation when White supremacists marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, seven years ago. Their fates diverged sharply Thursday. Trump accepted the nomination of a united party convinced it\u2019s cruising to victory in November, while Democrats splintered, with some fearing that their president could lead them to a landslide defeat after a cataclysmic debate performance sent his reelection campaign into freefall three weeks ago. Trump spoke on the last night of the Republican National Convention at the end of a week that he might not have lived to see after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt \u2013 the second stunning twist in three weeks in a suddenly transformed election campaign. \u201cJust a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended, we know that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd yet here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much, it\u2019s called America,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe live in a world of miracles.\u201d As the former president wistfully told the story of the horrific moment he came under attack in a Pennsylvania park on Saturday, he displayed rare vulnerability and reflection.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here tonight,\u201d Trump told the crowd, which broke into a spontaneous chant of \u201cyes you are, yes you are!\u201d The eyes of people high in the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 arena glistened with tears as Trump described how he heard a \u201cloud whizzing sound\u201d and felt something hit him \u201creally, really hard on (his) right ear.\u201d He survived, he said, because he had \u201cGod on (his) side.\u201d Trump\u2019s aides overpromised All week, Republicans have carved a narrative of an iron man of destiny who would drag a wounded America up off the dirt, just as he rose bloodied from his brush with death and held up a fist of defiance. But Trump\u2019s aides promised their candidate had also changed in the aftermath of a shooting that wounded him in the right ear \u2014 and would respond to his new lease on life with a message of national reconciliation and unity. And early in his remarks, Trump did reach for a vision of national renewal. \u201cThe discord and division in our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.\u201d But the new Trump lasted just a few minutes before the old version returned. Soon, the ex-president was ranting about weaponized justice, claiming falsely that foreign nations were sending people from their mental asylums over the US border and accusing Democrats of cheating in elections. The ex-president then tried to recreate the dystopian atmosphere of his searing 2016 convention speech \u2013 though the comparison with the intense night in Cleveland eight years ago served to underscore that Trump is eight years older and not quite the ferocious rhetorical force he once was. In the end, it was the same old speech full of untruths and rhetoric that alienates moderates that has left Trump deeply unpopular with half of America. The once and possibly future president painted a nostalgic and idealized vision of his term and accused Biden of driving into a ditch a country he himself left deeply divided and economically diminished. And he warned that perceived weakness abroad had created great danger. \u201cOur planet is teetering on the edge of World War III and this will be a war like no other,\u201d said Trump. Clashing political messages On a night dedicated to unity, the divisiveness of Trump\u2019s warm-up acts undercut the message, hinting at the hardline authoritarian undercurrent of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement that might characterize the second term of a former president who thinks he is entitled to unchecked power. Wrestler Hulk Hogan painted Trump in the light of a developing third-world dictator wielding unaccountable power. \u201cAll you criminals, all you low-lives, all you scumbags \u2026 what you gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you brother?\u201d Hogan roared. In an election that could be won by invigorating the Republican base \u2014 with the help of new MAGA favorite JD Vance as his vice presidential nominee \u2014 Trump\u2019s stark speech may serve its function. But it was hard to see how it would please swing voters and its tedious length, at 1 hour 32 minutes, stretched well past primetime. And for the Americans wondering how to pay for health care, how to afford a house or to send their kids to college, Trump offered no new details of what he\u2019d actually do in a second term. Trump\u2019s low-energy delivery in the vast arena was far less compelling that many of his campaign rallies, and it represented the most undisciplined, off-script moments of the entire convention. To be fair, he just survived an assassination attempt. But at times, in an election that is increasingly turning on the vulnerabilities of Biden\u2019s age, Trump looked every bit of his 78 years \u2013 and his rambling remarks could serve to embolden Democrats who believe that a more vigorous candidate on their side could thwart the ex-president\u2019s hopes of becoming only the second defeated one-term president to return to office. Still, in an age of social media and viral moments, it may not matter much that Trump went on so long. The most striking moments of the night \u2013 the ex-president\u2019s grand entrance against a huge backdrop of lights reading \u201cTrump,\u201d his scripted recollections of the assassination attempt and video of the ex-president huddled with his grandchildren in his box may be all that most Americans remember \u2013 and represented valuable imagery for a campaign that is already ahead. But there was also plenty for Democrats to fault and work with. And combined with Biden\u2019s troubles, the second half of the speech may have served best to illustrate one of the defining characteristics of the election: Americans are deeply unimpressed with either option. Biden\u2019s campaign tips into deepening crisis The speech followed a day of extraordinary developments in Biden\u2019s ailing reelection campaign, which has foundered since his faltering debate performance that validated the concerns of millions of voters who doubt he\u2019s fully fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Compounding his political woes, Biden this week has been forced to retreat to his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with a case of Covid-19, at a moment when many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials have come to believe the president must abandon his campaign for a second term. \u201cThe next 72 hours are big,\u201d one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on much longer.\u201d \u201cPeople see and feel the walls closing in,\u201d one senior Democrat said, CNN also reported. Another top Democrat close to the White House described Biden as having become \u201cexceptionally insulated and isolated\u201d since the\u00a0CNN debate in Atlanta on June 27. In a critical sign of the party\u2019s down-ballot concerns, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who faces the toughest reelection of any incumbent, became the latest senior Democrat to say Biden should step aside. \u201cI have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong. And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.\u201d Biden has argued that he\u2019s still the best Democratic hope to beat Trump \u2013 and, on the evidence of a keynote convention address on Thursday, the ex-president indeed looks beatable. But increasingly, events suggest that \ufeffthe mission may be entrusted to another, yet-to-be identified Democrat.

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee.

And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters", "text": "It was a remarkable moment Monday night at the Republican National Convention, surely creating some amount of confusion among longtime Republicans, when Sean O\u2019Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, delivered a stemwinder of a speech in prime time. He called former President Donald Trump a \u201ctough S.O.B.\u201d O\u2019Brien did not endorse Trump, but he leaned into the incongruity of speaking at the convention of a party that has long fought workers\u2019 ability to organize. The union could vote to endorse a candidate later this year. \u201cThe Teamsters are doing something correct if the extremes in both parties think I shouldn\u2019t be on this stage,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that the union has endorsed Republican presidents Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush in the past. This year, the Teamsters may not endorse any candidate, even though Biden has fashioned himself as the most pro-labor president in US history. Biden became the first president to join a picket line, when he appeared with striking auto workers in Michigan in 2023. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Teamsters are not interested if you have a \u201cD,\u201d \u201cR\u201d or an \u201cI\u201d next to your name. We want to know one thing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWhat are you doing to help American workers?\u201d Appearing Tuesday on \u201cInside Politics,\u201d O\u2019Brien told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash he would speak at both conventions, but has not yet been invited to the Democratic convention. \u201cThe partisanship is not working. We need bipartisan support, we need bipartisan cooperation,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding he would definitely speak at the Democratic convention. This after Biden bailed out a Teamster pension fund Biden must be particularly frustrated by O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech since as president in 2022, he OK\u2019d a $36 billion, one-time bailout of a Teamsters pension fund, warding off pension cuts for 350,000 workers and retirees. While Biden has the endorsement of key labor organizations like the AFL-CIO, there\u2019s growing concern among many labor leaders about his ability to win in November. Bash pointed out Trump\u2019s long history of opposing union rights, which O\u2019Brien did not dispute. \u201cIf we\u2019re not having the discussions, how can we change people\u2019s opinions?\u201d he asked. Republicans generally oppose organized labor, but JD Vance joined a picket line During his speech Monday night O\u2019Brien acknowledged the anti-union bent of much of the GOP and said it needs to change. That could take a while. Also Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, the anti-union Tesla boss who has endorsed Trump, would be showering a pro-Trump super PAC with $45 million per month in cash. But it is notable, as O\u2019Brien pointed out, that a handful of Republican senators, including Trump\u2019s new running mate Sen. JD Vance, have joined picket lines in recent years. Vance and other Republican senators, however, oppose the Democrats\u2019 proposal to pass a nationwide law, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, supported by labor unions including the Teamsters. Also, the selection of Vance, who also spent years as a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist, was praised by Musk. An anti-corporate message directed at workers, but an anti-union legacy for Trump If there was an overriding theme in speeches at the first night of the Republican convention, which were supposed to focus on Make America Wealthy Again, it was an anti-corporate and anti-elitist message, with frequent mentions of helping workers. That\u2019s in keeping with Trump\u2019s appeal to those who feel marginalized and left behind. Despite Trump\u2019s longtime pro-worker rhetoric, his record as president was decidedly anti-union, as CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore has written. The help Republicans were offering for workers at the RNC Monday, from a policy standpoint, is indirect. They\u2019re not endorsing raising the minimum wage, as Democrats have long supported. Trump is, on the other hand, pushing an idea to exempt tips from taxes. Many states allow employers to pay workers who get tips below that state\u2019s minimum wage. Trump and Vance\u2019s answer to helping auto workers is to end Democrats\u2019 emissions goals, which are meant to pivot the US toward more electric vehicles. The United Auto Workers is among the unions to endorse Biden. Marginal shifts are meaningful In an election that may yet be decided by marginal shifts in the electorate, any movement toward Trump among union households could spell disaster for Biden, who performed better in 2020 than Hillary Clinton in 2016 among union households both nationally and in key states. O\u2019Brien has a brash persona. He made headlines for nearly coming to fisticuffs with Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma who also happens to have been a professional mixed martial arts fighter. In a nod to that episode, O\u2019Brien namechecked Mullin and said he was paraphrasing the senator with this line: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s time for both sides of Congress to stand their butts up.\u2019 We need trade policies that put American workers first. It needs to be easier for companies to remain in America. We need legal protections that make it safer for workers to get a contract.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s worth going back to that original standoff between Mullin and O\u2019Brien, in which Mullin complained that a union had tried to infiltrate his plumbing business. That sounds a little more to type when you\u2019re considering traditional Republican views of unions. In Wisconsin, where the convention is taking place, the former Republican Gov. Scott Walker made a career out of busting government worker unions in his state until he lost a bid for reelection in 2018. Walker did enact so-called \u201cright to work\u201d legislation opposed by unions by making it easier for employees to work for companies without paying union dues even when there is a collective bargaining agreement. Multiple US states, most of them dominated by Republicans, have such legislation. There are many different types of unions and they each have different priorities. Police unions are going to see things differently than auto workers. Trump\u2019s promise to abolish taxes on tips seems tailored to gain some marginal support in Nevada, where he announced the proposal. Government worker unions are a strong part of the labor movement and unlikely to be getting any overtures from a new Trump administration, which has tried to paint the federal bureaucracy as an organized deep state opposed to him. But small movements among certain union members could have a huge impact in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Peters has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to 10 state charges \u2014 including three felony counts of attempting to influence a public servant; one felony account of criminal impersonation; two felony counts of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation; one felony count of identity theft; and misdemeanor counts for first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with requirements of the Colorado secretary of state \u2014 after an apparent security breach in Mesa County\u2019s elections office in May 2021. The criminal investigation into the clerk\u2019s office began after Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, accused Peters and her deputies of facilitating the 2021 security breach. The breach resulted in confidential voting machine logins and forensic images of their hard drives being published in a QAnon-affiliated Telegram channel in early August 2021. The Colorado breach was one of several incidents after 2020 where allies of former President Donald Trump tampered with election systems in hopes of proving his voter fraud claims. Loosely affiliated groups of Trump supporters orchestrated similar breaches in\u00a0Michigan,\u00a0Georgia and Pennsylvania, and others are facing charges. Peters\u2019 trial is set to begin on July 29. Two lower courts have rejected Peters\u2019 attempt to throw out the criminal case. Peters has argued that she was acting \u201cpursuant to an express federal order to preserve election records\u201d and is therefore immune from prosecution. \u201cNo serious argument, supported by any credible evidence, has been advanced that Ms. Peters\u2019 conduct was unreasonable or unnecessary to fulfill her federal duty to preserve election records,\u201d her attorneys told the Supreme Court, adding that the state indictment against her is a \u201ctransparently punitive move to criminalize her efforts to comply with federal law.\u201d Peters is asking the high court to pause the impending trial so they can file a more fulsome appeal to the justices. It\u2019s possible that the court will set a briefing schedule in the coming days as it considers her request to halt the state court proceedings.

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time", "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said that Iran\u2019s breakout time \u2013 the amount of time needed to produce enough weapons grade material for a nuclear weapon \u2013 \u201cis now probably one or two weeks\u201d as Tehran has continued to develop its nuclear program. The assessment marks the shortest breakout time that US officials have ever referenced and comes as Iran has taken steps in recent months to boost its production of fissile material. \u201cWhere we are now is not in a good place,\u201d the top US diplomat said at the Aspen Security Forum Friday. \u201cIran, because the nuclear agreement was thrown out, instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t produced a weapon itself, but that\u2019s something of course that we track very, very carefully,\u201d Blinken added. Blinken said the policy of the US is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that the administration would prefer to stop that from happening through diplomacy. Over a year ago a top US Defense Department official said that Iran could now produce \u201cone bomb\u2019s worth of fissile material\u201d in \u201cabout 12 days.\u201d The Biden administration engaged in more than a year of indirect negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, from which the US withdrew in 2018 under the Trump administration. Those efforts collapsed in late 2022, as the US accused Iran of making \u201cunreasonable\u201d demands related to a probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN nuclear watchdog, into unexplained traces of uranium found at undisclosed Iranian sites. In the months that followed, the administration maintained that the Iran nuclear deal was \u201cnot on the agenda.\u201d Iran\u2019s new president has suggested they are open to engagement with the West. However, a senior State Department official told CNN that they no longer believe that there can be a return to the nuclear deal because Iran has engaged in too many escalatory acts in the years since talks broke down. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very different world, a lot of time has elapsed, Iran has done a lot of things that make a return to JCPOA non-viable,\u201d the official said. The State Department also said that there is no anticipation that the recent election in Iran will change the country\u2019s behavior. \u201cWe have no expectations that this election will lead to a fundamental change in Iran\u2019s direction or its policies,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier this month. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not the president that has the ultimate say over the future of Iran\u2019s policy; it is the supreme leader, and of course we have seen the direction that he has chosen to take Iran in.\u00a0 Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we would welcome. But needless to say, we don\u2019t have any expectations that that\u2019s what\u2019s likely to ensue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_trump-rally-gunman-portrait-motive-invs", "text": "After conducting more than 200 interviews and combing through his phone and internet search history, federal investigators have pieced together an early portrait of the man who sought to assassinate former President Donald Trump: Thomas Matthew Crooks was an intelligent, unassuming loner, who expressed an interest in guns and was far from outspoken about politics. But the emerging profile of Crooks nearly a week after the shooting has left authorities puzzled about a motive for his assault and has had investigators speculating that his intentions may have been less politically motivated and more about\u00a0attacking\u00a0the highest-profile target near him. The investigation remains in its\u00a0early stages, officials caution. Still, in some ways, Crooks seems similar to the dozens of other young men who\u2019ve wreaked havoc across the US with high-powered assault-style rifles in recent years. He had few close friends, he would often go shooting at a local firing range, and he didn\u2019t seem to display strongly held views that would suggest a politically driven assassination, according to CNN interviews with law enforcement and a review of notes from a briefing to Congress. In addition to the former president, Crooks had searched online about President Joe Biden and had photos on his phone of other prominent figures from both parties. He searched for the location of Trump\u2019s rally as well as the upcoming Democratic National Convention, the briefing notes say, and discovered that Trump planned to appear just an hour\u2019s drive away from his home in the Pittsburgh suburbs. That suggests Crooks may have been looking to carry out a high-profile shooting, and the Trump event\u2019s proximity and timing offered the most accessible opportunity, federal officials have speculated. \u201cEven though he didn\u2019t get his primary target, the shooter was successful in a lot of ways because he got closer to doing something no one has done in decades,\u201d one federal official told CNN, referring to the assassination of a presidential candidate. It remains unclear if Crooks intended to carry out a much larger attack and started with Trump because that was the way to gain the most notoriety. Crooks had also\u00a0searched for information\u00a0on another recent mass shooter who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021. The web searches about that shooter, Ethan Crumbley, are consistent with what law enforcement officials have seen in other mass shooters who research people they wish to emulate, in part, as a way to form their own idea of how to do something bigger, the federal official said. But there are also significant differences between Crooks\u2019 behavior and that of a typical mass shooter. On the day of the attack, Crooks appeared to have been specifically targeting Trump \u2013 not aiming at the crowds in an attempt to kill as many people as possible. While he had an improvised explosive in the trunk of his car, it\u2019s not clear if he planned to set it off to kill people or as a distraction. Kathleen Puckett, a former FBI behavioral analyst who worked on the case of the \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski, said that Crooks also appeared to have less firepower than many mass shooters, who often carry multiple weapons and wear body armor. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look to me like he was ready for an assault,\u201d Puckett said, while noting the limits of publicly available information. \u201cIt looked to me like he was taking a window that he saw a vulnerability in where he felt that he was unobserved to the extent he could get off some critical shots.\u201d In addition, unlike other mass shooters who often leave behind writings to explain their attacks, authorities have thus far recovered few clues, in Crooks\u2019 bedroom or online. That is frustrating experts who are trying to piece together his mindset \u2013 and raising comparisons with Stephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 60 people in Las Vegas in 2017. Nearly seven years after America\u2019s deadliest mass shooting, investigators still do not know why Paddock pulled the trigger. Like the Las Vegas massacre, \u201cthis may be a situation where the more we know, the less we understand about the exact reason why,\u201d said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a CNN national security analyst. Crooks\u2019 family members told investigators he did not openly discuss politics, and evidence recovered at his home shed no further light on his political values or ideology, according to a readout shared with CNN that details a briefing that FBI and US Secret Service officials gave lawmakers Wednesday. Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole, a former FBI profiler, said that based on the evidence assembled so far, she thought that Trump\u2019s rally was \u201cvery appealing\u201d to Crooks in part because it \u201cfell in his backyard.\u201d \u201cThis gave him incredible attention and catapulted him to a point where I think that\u2019s why he chose this,\u201d she speculated. Still, Puckett called lone offenders \u2013 who largely remain invisible before attacks \u2013 \u201cone of the prickliest problems out there\u201d for law enforcement, and warned against a rush to find simple answers about Crooks\u2019 motive. \u201cWhatever his story turns out to be, it\u2019s not going to be simplistic, I don\u2019t think \u2013 it\u2019s going to be more complicated,\u201d Puckett said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the simplistic version. You want every detail you can find.\u201d CNN\u2019s Scott Glover, Allison Gordon and Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/trump-rally-gunman-portrait-motive-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_politics_us-sanctions-alleged-russian-hackers", "text": "The US Treasury Department on Friday sanctioned two alleged members of a Russian cybercriminal gang that has claimed responsibility for a slew of hacks against US critical infrastructure providers, including a cyberattack in January that caused a tank at a Texas water facility to overflow. Treasury posted photos of the two alleged hackers \u2014\u00a0Yuliya Vladimirovna Pankratova and\u00a0Denis Olegovich Degtyarenko\u00a0\u2014\u00a0unmasking them from the anonymous social media accounts that they tend to hide behind. Pankratova and Degtyarenko\u00a0are allegedly part of a politically motivated hacking group called\u00a0Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR) that has claimed credit for a series of cyberattacks against American and European organizations in support of Russia. The string of hacks alarmed US officials because of how easy they were to pull off. The hackers logged into sensitive industrial software system that is supposed to be separated from the public internet.\u00a0US national security adviser Jake Sullivan\u00a0appealed\u00a0to state officials and water authorities to shore up their cyber defenses. The hack in January in the small town of Muleshoe, in north Texas,\u00a0wasted tens of thousands of gallons of water, according to the Treasury Department. It\u00a0coincided with at least two other towns in north Texas\u00a0taking precautionary defensive measures. Sanctions against criminal hackers are increasingly common as the US government tries to deter both politically and financially motivated computer operatives. Among CARR\u2019s other claimed targets was a\u00a0wastewater treatment plant in Indiana. The hackers tend to blend their unsophisticated hacking efforts with psychological operations designed to drum up interests in the group and spread panic among targets. They have, for example, released videos of them purporting to infiltrate water systems set to dramatic music. \u201cRussia continues to provide a safe haven to cybercriminals and enable their malicious cyber activities against the United States and its allies and partners,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWhile CARR\u2019s lack of sophistication and victims\u2019 responses have thus far prevented any instances of major damage, unauthorized access to critical infrastructure systems poses an elevated risk of harm to the public and can result in devastating humanitarian consequences,\u201d Miller said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/us-sanctions-alleged-russian-hackers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "politics"}}
