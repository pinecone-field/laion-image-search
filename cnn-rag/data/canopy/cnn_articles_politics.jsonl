Trump had been holding the event at the Butler Farm Show Grounds on Saturday afternoon. The gunman fired multiple shots from an \u201celevated position\u201d outside the rally, according to the Secret Service. Law enforcement sources told CNN the shooter was\u00a0on a building rooftop\u00a0just outside the rally venue. Trump was injured in the shooting, which the\u00a0FBI says was an assassination attempt. A gunman and at least one audience member are dead, the Secret Service said. The gunman was killed by Secret Service personnel, according to the agency. In a news conference, Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office, said it was \u201csurprising\u201d the gunman was able to fire multiple shots during the rally for Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re still working through\u00a0the security apparatus that the\u00a0Secret Service had in place, what potentially happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a long\u00a0investigation into exactly what\u00a0took place and how the\u00a0individual was able to get access\u00a0to the location, what type of\u00a0weapon he had.

The interview was filmed on Friday, the day before the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump and was published on Monday. Biden also spoke extensively about the war in Gaza for the first time in weeks \u2013 with the bulk of his recent interviews being focused on the president\u2019s age and capabilities to run the country after his shaky CNN debate performance on June 27. Asked directly by the interviewer whether he is a Zionist, Biden said, \u201cyes.\u201d Biden has often described himself as such before and since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. Some progressives have pushed the president to show more public compassion for the plight of Palestinians in the face of months of Israelis bombardments that have killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, many of them using US munitions. Biden seemed to anticipate that some factions would take issue with his description of himself as a Zionist. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a Jew to be a\u00a0Zionist, and a\u00a0Zionist\u00a0is about whether or not Israel is a safe haven for Jews because of their history of how they\u2019ve been persecuted,\u201d Biden said \u201cNow, you\u2019ll be able to make a lot of that because different people don\u2019t know what a Zionist is,\u201d he added.

Blood could be seen on his face as he was carried away by Secret Service. Get live updates on the breaking news. Multiple presidents and former presidents and candidates for president have been attacked in US history, according to a CNN report from 2011 and a list of instances of political violence that includes attacks on senators, congressmen and governors compiled by CNN\u2019s research library. Multiple presidents, former presidents or candidates have survived assassination attempts In the pre-Civil War era, President Andrew Jackson was shot at while attending a funeral in the Capitol. The shooter fired twice, but the gun failed. Former President Theodore Roosevelt, like Trump, was trying to get his old job back during the 1912 campaign. He was shot on the way to a speech in Milwaukee by a saloon keeper. Roosevelt later said a folded-up copy of his 50-page speech slowed the bullet, which stayed in his body for the rest of his life. He gave the speech despite the shooting. Franklin D. Roosevelt was president-elect when a would-be assassin fired at him in Miami in 1933. The shooter, Guiseppe Zangara, missed Roosevelt but killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. He was put to death by electrocution. Harry Truman, who took over the presidency after Roosevelt died, was shot at across from the White House by Puerto Rican nationalists in 1950. Alabama Gov. George Wallace, a segregationist who was running for president for the third time in 1972, was shot after a campaign event outside Washington, DC. The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down, and he later rethought his politics. Gerald Ford faced two assassination attempts in quick succession in 1975. Lynette \u201cSqeaky\u201d Fromme, a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, was foiled before she could fire at Ford in Sacramento, California. Weeks later, a woman named Sara Jane Moore shot at Ford in San Francisco but missed because a bystander grabbed her. Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton in Washington, DC, after giving a speech. His press secretary, James Brady, was more seriously wounded than Reagan and later became an activist for gun control. Reagan\u2019s shooter, John Hinckley, spent decades in a mental institution. He was released from court supervision in 2022. All presidents face threats and all former presidents also get lifetime Secret Service protection. An Idaho man was charged with the attempted assassination of Barack Obama when he fired shots at the White House in 2011. A man was charged with trying to assassinate then-President Bill Clinton in 1994 after shooting at the White House, and a plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush in Kuwait was foiled in 1993, after he left office. His son, then-President George W. Bush, faced a failed assassination attempt by a man with a grenade while visiting the country Georgia in 2005. Four US presidents\u00a0who\u00a0were assassinated\u00a0were all\u00a0shot Abraham Lincoln was the first president to die by assassination. He was shot in the back of the head in 1865 during an appearance at Ford\u2019s Theater in Washington, DC, by John Wilkes Booth, an actor in the play that night and Southern sympathizer. Booth fled the scene and was shot when he was captured weeks later in Virginia. James Garfield was shot at a train station in Washington, DC, in July 1881. He died from his wounds months later, in September, in New Jersey. Garfield was shot by Charles Guiteau, a disaffected former supporter with mental illness who was angry at not getting a job in Garfield\u2019s administration. Guiteau was convicted and hanged within the year. William McKinley was shot in September 1901 in Buffalo, New York, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. McKinley was making an appearance at the Pan-American Exposition. He lingered for days in Buffalo before dying from his wounds. Czolgosz was later electrocuted. John F. Kennedy was killed by a sniper, Lee Harvey Oswald, in Dallas in November 1963 as he was driven down a parade route in an open-topped limousine. Oswald, a Soviet sympathizer, was arrested shortly after the assassination. Oswald was himself killed by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas police station. JFK\u2019s brother, Robert F. Kennedy, was a senator from New York when he was running for president in 1968. RFK was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles the night he won the California Democratic primary. His killer, Sirhan Sirhan, is still in jail in California and recently had a parole request denied. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an independent candidate for president this year.

{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_biden-political-challenge-2024", "text": "President Joe Biden was bracing for a week of political onslaught. More Democratic lawmakers were expected to publicly call on him to drop out of the 2024 race, a\u00a0grueling campaign schedule would put his stamina on display and a high-stakes TV interview was sure to once again spotlight questions about his age, health and fitness to serve a second term. When gunshots rang out at a Donald Trump political rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening, much of that appeared to change. At least for a brief moment, politics largely came to a halt.\u00a0As bipartisan calls condemning the horrific attack on Trump poured in from all corners of the country, the Biden campaign immediately paused TV ads and political communications, and the White House would also postpone the president\u2019s trip to Monday to Texas, where he had planned to attend a fundraiser. He also addressed the nation from the Oval Office, calling for a lowering of the political temperature. Something else largely came to a halt: The calls from within Biden\u2019s own party for him to abandon his campaign for a second term. Until that moment, those calls had been growing by the day since his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month. Even as the Biden campaign\u00a0is working to delicately navigate a moment\u00a0of national\u00a0trauma and shock, some allies of the president are privately hopeful that the assassination attempt on Trump may ultimately end up quelling the Democratic dissent\u00a0as\u00a0the party recognizes the importance of standing as a united front. Biden\u00a0returns to the campaign trail this\u00a0week when he visits Nevada, a critical swing state.\u00a0The trip\u00a0will mark\u00a0his\u00a0first public test of campaigning against his predecessor in front of the backdrop of a country reeling from the shocking images of Saturday.\u00a0Before he leaves for Las Vegas, Biden will sit down with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt at the White House \u2013 an interview that now holds a difference kind of significance in the aftermath of the fatal Trump rally. \u201cI think it should,\u201d one close Biden ally told CNN when asked if that may end up being a result of Saturday\u2019s attack. But, they added, \u201cit\u2019s too early to tell. The tone of the next few days, especially with the RNC convention, will have a big impact.\u201d Democratic operatives had viewed the days after Biden\u2019s press conference at the NATO summit late last week as a critical inflection point for his campaign amid a slow build of calls for the president to step aside. While allies acknowledged that the president\u2019s solo news conference was\u00a0far\u00a0stronger than his debate performance, concerns remained \u2013 including among donors who continued to hold back big-dollar donations. \u201cIt all comes down to this weekend,\u201d one strategist aware of Democratic lawmakers on the fence about abandoning the Biden effort had told CNN prior to the weekend. Following the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, those discussions were paused \u2013 but not stopped entirely, these sources said, as the political establishment assessed the repercussions and the need for the president to assume a leadership role. Biden spent the first 24 hours following the Trump rally trying to reassure the nation in three separate speeches \u2013 including the rare prime time Oval Office address \u2013 and promising in between briefings from the heads of various law enforcement agencies that his administration would answer for Saturday\u2019s massive security breach. Before the Trump rally in Pennsylvania got underway,\u00a0Biden had spent Saturday afternoon on a tense call with a moderate group of House Democrats known as the New Democrat Coalition. One of the toughest questions came from Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, who asked Biden whether concerns about his mental acuity would affect national security, two sources told CNN. Biden was animated, per sources, as he defended his record and pointed to the work he has done to strengthen NATO. Lawmakers also sought reassurances from Biden over the course of the call, but those sometimes fell flat,\u00a0and sources described the president\u2019s responses as defensive. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an answer to the question about what he\u2019s going to do to change the momentum of the campaign,\u201d Democratic Rep. Adam Smith told CNN following the call Saturday, adding that the president largely focused on his accomplishments in office. \u201cThe message we\u2019ve been getting from him and his team: Shut up, fall in line, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d said Smith, who has urged Biden to step aside. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d While that outreach campaign unfolded, some of the president\u2019s closest allies\u00a0were pushing\u00a0for unity. \u201cAll corners of the party need to be working in tandem if we are going to be successful,\u201d Rep. Jim Clyburn told Al Sharpton on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cPolitics Nation\u201d Saturday, prior to the Trump rally shooting. \u201cSo, what I want to see happen is for us to focus on the future for a little while, especially while the other side is in their convention.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also traveled to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, to meet with Biden over the weekend \u2013 an indication of the ongoing party angst. Schumer described the meeting as \u201cgood\u201d in a statement, but a person familiar with the conversation said it was as candid and frank as one Biden held with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries two nights earlier. Neither Schumer nor Jeffries, who both have expressed worry about damage to the Democratic ticket, implicitly announced after their respective meetings that they were fully supportive of Biden\u2019s decision to stay in the race. Biden advisers had also been bracing for the Sunday shows as a likely venue for potential high-profile defections. But those expected discussions were quickly eclipsed by the response to the assassination attempt on Biden\u2019s predecessor and political opponent. With the Biden campaign in full survival mode, advisers had hoped the president\u2019s speech in Detroit on Friday would help quell some of the concerns Democrats harbored about his candidacy, including his ability to effectively make the case against his GOP rival. Standing before a supportive Michigan crowd urging him not to leave the race, Biden delivered one of his most forceful rebukes of Trump of the election cycle and outlined in detail for the first time what the first 100 days of a second Biden term would entail. \u201cWe think that our voters are going to care about the issues and that is what\u2019s going to matter when they go to the ballot box,\u201d one campaign aide had said after the speech. \u201cOutside the Beltway, it feels different, it looks different and things that motivate people are different.\u201d Republicans are moving forward with their national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this week, rallying around Trump as images of the defiant former president pumping his fist in the air \u2013 the right side of his head bloodied \u2013 have become some of the most iconic in modern American history.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/biden-political-challenge-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_trump-vp-pick-jd-vance", "text": "Donald Trump has named US Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, further elevating the Ohio Republican who has adopted the former president\u2019s populist agenda after years of pointed criticism of Trump. \u201cAfter lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Trump\u2019s selection came on the first day of the Republican National Convention and just two days after he survived an assassination attempt at his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, over the weekend. On the floor of the convention, shortly after news of Vance\u2019s selection broke, delegates celebrating the party\u2019s ticket were writing Vance\u2019s name onto Trump signs using markers. Trump called Vance on Monday, to officially offer him the spot 20 minutes before the former president made the announcement on Truth Social,\u00a0a source familiar with the process told CNN. The two had met at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, before the rally at which Trump was shot in the ear. Ahead of Trump\u2019s selection of Vance, the Ohio senator\u2019s supporters, including Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and conservative media figure Tucker Carlson, had argued that Vance has the strongest relationship with Trump of a group of finalists that also included Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and would be the most loyal selection, multiple sources familiar with the discussions said. They made the case that Vance can appeal to working-class voters viewed as essential to winning the key battleground states in November, given his upbringing in a poor Rust Belt town in Ohio. They also pointed to his wife, Usha Chilukuri \u2014 the child of Indian immigrants \u2014 as being someone who could appeal to minority voters, the sources said. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, on the convention floor, described Trump\u2019s selection of Vance as \u201ca great day for Ohio.\u201d \u201cHe is consistent with Trump\u2019s appeal to working men and women,\u201d DeWine said, adding that he thought it was wise for Trump to pick someone younger. \u201cAlso, someone who shares his desire to expand the base of the Republican Party.\u201d A turnaround on Trump Vance, a venture capitalist and the author of the best-selling memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d was elected to the Senate in 2022 after receiving a boost from Trump in a contentious Republican primary. It was a reversal from just six years earlier. Vance was a key voice in the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement during the 2016 election and has a well-documented history of opposing the former president publicly. CNN previously reported that Vance liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in a Hillary Clinton administration. But he earned Trump\u2019s endorsement in the 2022 Ohio Republican Senate primary after a concerted yearlong effort by Vance to embrace a new image as a leading MAGA proponent, courting the former president at meetings in Mar-a-Lago and through appearances on Fox News. In a display of loyalty, Vance was one of several potential running mates and Republican lawmakers to stand by Trump\u2019s side at a New York courthouse during his criminal hush money trial. He\u2019s also made clear that his view of the constitutional limits on a vice president\u2019s role in certifying election results differs from that of former Vice President Mike Pence, who drew the ire of Trump in January 2021, when he opted not to interfere in the process of approving electoral votes for Joe Biden. Vance told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in May that he was \u201cextremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger,\u201d even though some members of the pro-Trump mob that broke into the US Capitol were calling for Pence to be hanged. In a separate May interview on CNN, Vance said he would commit to accepting the 2024 election results \u201cif it\u2019s a free and fair election.\u201d \u201cIf you think there were problems, you have to be willing to pursue those problems and try to prosecute your case. And certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I\u2019ll accept the results,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in the 2020 election. Vance\u2019s persona has endeared him to the right wing of the Republican Party, including Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., who has hosted the Ohio Republican on his podcast and praised him publicly. In Congress, Vance has been a vocal opponent of foreign aid, opposing legislation to send more aid from the US to Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s war. In addition to his MAGA credentials, Vance also brings ties to traditionally liberal-leaning Silicon Valley to the presidential ticket. He recently helped organize a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco hosted by prominent tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya. Democrats pounce on Trump\u2019s pick President Joe Biden, weighing in on Trump\u2019s running mate selection for the first time late Monday afternoon, described Vance as a \u201cclone\u201d of Trump on policy matters. \u201cHe\u2019s a clone of Trump on the issues,\u201d Biden said before boarding Air Force One. \u201cA clone of Trump on the issues, so I don\u2019t see any difference.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign cast\u00a0Vance as a Trump enabler in the moments after he was announced as the vice presidential pick. \u201cVance will do what Mike Pence wouldn\u2019t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the harm to the American people,\u201d Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement. She described Vance as \u201cone of the most far-right extremists in Washington,\u201d pointing to previous endorsements and his friendship with \u00a0firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia. Biden\u2019s campaign also invoked Vance\u2019s previous criticism of Trump in a fundraising appeal emailed to supporters Monday afternoon. \u201cHow does a guy who used to say that Donald Trump and his policies were \u2018reprehensible,\u2019 become Donald Trump\u2019s running mate? Through years of being a rubber-stamp for Donald Trump\u2019s extreme, MAGA agenda. You might even say he\u2019s the poster child for Project 2025,\u201d the appeal said. Democrats immediately signaled that they plan to highlight Vance\u2019s previous comments on abortion, which have gone farther than Trump in pushing for national restrictions. A day after Ohio voters approved a ballot measure to protect access to abortion last year, Vance urged Republicans to embrace a federal ban on abortion to more effectively make the case to voters about the GOP\u2019s position. In November 2023, Vance told CNN that Republicans need to focus on \u201cpersuasion\u201d to sway voters towards their position, while arguing the GOP needs to press for a national standard banning abortion \u2014 either at 15 or 20 weeks \u2014 with some exceptions. \u201cIt seems to suggest there needs to be some more interest in this building among Republicans in setting some sort of minimum national standard, whether that\u2019s it\u2019s 15 weeks or 20 weeks or the different ranges that are thrown out there,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Ted Barrett in the Capitol. \u201cWe keep giving into the idea that the federal Congress has no role in this matter. Because if it doesn\u2019t it, then the pro-life movement is basically not gonna exist, I think, for the next couple of years.\u201d While Vance said he expected most states to adopt their own bans, \u201cthere\u2019s some reason I think we should have some minimum national standard.\u201d Vance added: \u201cI think that a majority of Americans would support a 15-week pain capable ban, assuming you had the exceptions, but then you\u2019re still gonna have the gross majority of abortion policy banned at the state level. And I think that\u2019s probably the kind of compromise we need to think about.\u201d Abortion could be a key issue if Vance and Vice President Kamala Harris meet for a debate. Harris called Vance on Monday \u2014 but did not reach him and left a voicemail, a Biden campaign official said. She congratulated him on his selection, welcomed him to the race and express her hope that the two can meet in the vice-presidential debate proposed by CBS News. Vance didn\u2019t answer Harris\u2019 phone call because it came from an unknown number, and he was unable to call back. Staff for Vance\u2019s team was in touch with Harris\u2019 team and working on setting up a call Monday night, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_joe-biden-reaction-trump-shooting", "text": "President Joe Biden said he is grateful former President Donald Trump is safe after a shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania. Speaking from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, about two hours after the shooting, Biden said, \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sick,\u201d the president added. With the apparent shooting threatening to further inflame political rhetoric in the months ahead of November, Biden took the opportunity to call for the country to unite. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this,\u201d he said. Biden and Trump spoke late Saturday night, a White House official said. The shooting \u2013 which is being investigated as an attempted assassination, according to law enforcement officials \u2013 left Trump bleeding from the ear. A spokesperson said the former president was doing \u201cfine\u201d and being treated at a medical facility. The suspected shooter and at least one rally attendee were killed, Butler County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. Biden was attending mass at St. Edmond\u2019s Catholic\u00a0Church in Rehoboth Beach when the shooting occurred. The president is due to return to the White House late Saturday night, cutting short his planned weekend in Delaware. He\u2019ll receive an updated briefing from homeland security and law enforcement officials on Sunday, the White House official said.  The shooting marks a massive turning point not only for the country, but for Biden\u2019s role as president: he entered the church as a president fighting for his political future and exited in a familiar role - the nation\u2019s counsellor in chief now tasked with bringing the United States together during a serious crisis. The shooting at Trump\u2019s rally is a shocking turn in what has been a highly charged political season for both of the major-party candidates. Biden has pitched the race as the decision between the continuation and possible destruction of democracy in the United States. That rhetoric will now be closely examined in the aftermath of the apparent attack, including comments that the president made in a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. Biden said in a statement earlier Saturday that he was praying for Trump: \u201cJill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There\u2019s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.\u201d Inside Biden campaign\u2019s response Moments after the incident, Biden campaign officials huddled and decided to pull down all TV ads and limit their public campaign messaging. Bidens campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez and chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon sent a note to campaign staff Saturday evening in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, urging staff to \u201crefrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re also asking everyone to pause any proactive campaign communication across all platforms and in all circumstances until we know more,\u201d they wrote in a note, which was obtained by CNN. Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez and O\u2019Malley Dillon began the note by saying that as more information comes in, they are \u201cgrateful to the members of law enforcement who immediately jumped into action and wishing Trump a quick and full recovery.\u201d Mood inside the White House is \u2018shock\u2019 The mood inside the White House is \u201cshock\u201d as officials responded to the shooting, according to a senior administration official, and who added that officials wanted \u201cto be responsive and serious.\u201d Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, sent a brief note to White House staff Saturday evening, saying that the president was \u201cclosely\u201d tracking the situation and would continue to provide updates, according to the note obtained by CNN. Biden told his staff that he wanted to address the nation as soon as he was briefed, according to a source familiar with the matter. \u201cIt is just really horrible,\u201d the senior administration official said, responding to how the reaction has been within the White House following the incident. \u201cIt should never happen. It\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d a senior White House official told CNN. This story has been updated with additional developments.

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this. You know what I mean?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/wisconsin-voters-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_rally-shooting-aftermath-trump-god", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has responded to the assassination attempt against him in a manner unfamiliar to some of those around him: with a calm and seemingly methodic resolve. Since being pulled off a Butler, Pennsylvania, stage bloodied and defiant by Secret Service agents, Trump has spent the\u00a0past\u00a0two days sharing his harrowing experience with close allies and advisers. In conversations both public and private, Trump has said he is lucky to be alive after Saturday\u2019s rally. To some, Trump has even suggested divine intervention spared his life. \u201cIt was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening,\u201d\u202fTrump wrote in a Truth Social post in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. \u201cWe will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness.\u201d That sentiment is one Trump has truly internalized, according to some of those who have spoken to him in recent days, and one Trump, who is not an especially religious or spiritual man, has reiterated during the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s traumatic event. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here, I\u2019m supposed to be dead,\u201d\u202fTrump\u202fsaid during an interview with the New York Post Sunday. \u201cBy luck or by God, many people are saying it\u2019s by God,\u00a0I\u2019m still here.\u201d It\u2019s a conviction\u00a0that will certainly reinforce the messianic imagery of Trump long promoted by his most ardent supporters and the evangelical communities that have stood by him for years. Indeed, outside the venue Saturday, as rallygoers were evacuated,\u00a0they passed a truck emblazoned with images of Trump seated in front of\u00a0Jesus, whose hands rested on the former president\u2019s shoulders. \u201cGod Bless President Trump,\u201d the billboard said. Trump, who has long believed he could be a target of political violence, has responded to Saturday\u2019s harrowing events by calling for the country to come together. In a series of interviews on Sunday with conservative media, Trump said he threw out the searing speech he intended to deliver when he accepts the Republican Party\u2019s nomination at the convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThe speech I was going to give was a real humdinger,\u201d Trump told the Washington Examiner. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s going to be a whole different speech now.\u201d On Sunday, Trump wrote \u201cUnite America!\u201d on his Truth Social as he looked ahead to the convention. By Monday, though, Trump had expanded his definition of harmony to include dropping all of the legal cases against him. \u201cThe Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, ME,\u201d Trump posted to Truth Social shortly after Judge Aileen Cannon\u00a0dismissed the federal case over Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents. The events of the weekend rattled Trump\u2019s family and close advisers, some of whom have spent most days with the former president since he announced his campaign for reelection in late 2022. In conversations with more than a dozen aides, allies and advisers, they described a campaign that remains resolved to march ahead, taking cues from their boss, who popped up after being injured in the rally shooting to thrust a fist in the air and yell, \u201cFight.\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s just feeling very grateful and very relieved that, whether it\u2019s divine intervention or luck, or whatever it is, just super grateful,\u201d one senior adviser said. \u201cI mean, it could have turned out really, really bad.\u201d A person close to Trump said the family is feeling \u201cspiritual, in a way\u201d as they take stock of nearly losing their patriarch.\u00a0In a Sunday Instagram, Eric Trump shared a picture of his mother and Trump\u2019s ex-wife Ivana shaking hands with Ronald Reagan, who had also survived an assassination attempt while president in 1981. \u201cTwo years ago today, we lost this incredible woman!\u201d Eric Trump wrote. \u201cI have no doubt she was watching down on my father last night \u2013 it was nothing short of divine intervention\u2026\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s children have made similar remarks in private tying the anniversary of their mother\u2019s death to Trump avoiding disaster, the person said. Saturday was not the first time Trump averted disaster since entering presidential politics a decade ago. In 2016, Secret Service agents sprinted to surround then-candidate Trump when a protester rushed the stage. At the end of that campaign, Trump was again whisked away by his secret service detail when authorities suspected someone in his audience was armed. In his final year as president, Trump also battled a Covid-19 case that marked the most serious known health threat to a sitting American president in decades. Then, a visibly diminished Trump nevertheless defiantly said upon leaving Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life,\u201d even as he struggled to recover from a virus had killed tens of thousands of Americans, including his friend, Herman Cain. None of those run-ins with disaster, though, elicited quite a response like the one from Trump in the past 48 hours.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_jd-vance-trump-vp-what-to-know", "text": "With Donald Trump\u2019s choice to make JD Vance his running mate, he adds to the ticket an author and senator once known as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the former president\u2019s voter base. The onetime \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance, 39, shot to fame over his 2016 memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d and would eventually win over Trump ahead of his run for Senate. The former lawyer and venture capitalist has since become a loyal follower of Trump and heir-apparent to his particular brand of Republican populist politics. Family and background\n                   Vance was born in Middletown, Ohio, on August 2, 1984, and spent some of his childhood in Kentucky. He served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 before attending the Ohio State University and Yale Law School. Vance later worked as a venture capitalist before running for office. Vance\u2019s wife, Usha, is a\u00a0litigator\u00a0and fellow Yale Law School alum who previously clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Judge Brett Kavanaugh, then of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\u00a0They have three children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. \u2018Hillbilly Elegy\u2019 In 2016, Vance released his bestselling book, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d which chronicled his childhood in a poor Rust Belt town in eastern Ohio and captured the struggles of America\u2019s White working class. His understanding of the population that turned out to support Trump\u2019s first presidential run made him a frequent guest on cable news programs during Trump\u2019s run and presidency. He was a CNN contributor from 2017 to 2018. The book was turned into a 2020 Netflix movie starring Amy Adams and Glenn Close. Once a Trump critic CNN\u2019s KFile reported last month that Vance liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one post speculating that Vance could serve in 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 something Vance now defends Trump over. KFile also previously reported that Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance in February 2016\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler,\u201d\u00a0and a few months later\u00a0wrote in The Atlantic\u00a0that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also\u00a0said he\u00a0even contemplated voting for Clinton in 2016, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin. Senate\n                   The freshman senator from Ohio won his election in 2022 after receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement out of a pack of better-polling rivals. He was also funded heavily by pro-Trump tech mogul Peter Thiel. Vance has been a vocal opponent of foreign aid in Congress, opposing legislation to send more aid from the US to Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s war. A day after Ohio voters approved a 2023 ballot measure to protect access to abortion, Vance urged Republicans to embrace a federal ban on the procedure to more effectively make the case to voters about the GOP\u2019s position \u2014 breaking from Trump\u2019s stance that the issue should be left up to states. Recent Trump support Since receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement for Senate, Vance has become a strong ally of the former president. Ahead of his Senate campaign, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told\u00a0CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. Recently, Vance stood by Trump\u2019s side at a New York courthouse during the former president\u2019s criminal hush money trial. He has also made clear that his view of the constitutional limits on a vice president\u2019s role in certifying election results differs from that of former Vice President Mike Pence, who drew Trump\u2019s ire in January 2021 when he opted not to interfere in the process of approving electoral votes for Joe Biden. Vance earlier this year told ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d that he would not have certified the 2020 election results until states submitted pro-Trump electors. The Ohio senator committed to accepting the 2024 election results in May during an interview with CNN, provided it\u2019s a \u201cfree and fair election\u201d and despite the winner. He emphasized then that Republicans and Democrats should have the opportunity to pursue any issues in the elections, as they have in the past, pointing to 2000 and 2020. No evidence of widespread fraud was found in the 2020 election. Following Saturday\u2019s attempted assassination of Trump, Vance posted on social media in part blaming Biden\u2019s campaign: \u201cToday is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kit Maher, Em Steck,\u00a0Andrew Kaczynski,\u00a0Allison Gordon, Alayna Treene, Rashard Rose, and reporter Dan Merica contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/jd-vance-trump-vp-what-to-know/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim", "text": "Friends and neighbors are remembering firefighter Corey Comperatore \u2013 the man shot and killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump \u2013 as a family man who served his community and was quick to help friends in need. Comperatore was one of the thousands of people who attended the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection effort. He died trying to protect his family, according to Gov. Josh Shapiro. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed his identity on Sunday. Authorities have\u00a0identified the gunman\u00a0in Saturday\u2019s\u00a0attack\u00a0as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI is investigating the attack as an assassination attempt, the agency said. Shapiro, who directed flags to be flown at half-staff in Comperatore\u2019s memory, said he spoke to Comperatore\u2019s wife and two daughters Sunday. An avid Trump supporter who was excited to be at the rally, Comperatore dove on his family to protect them from the gunfire, Shapiro said. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family,\u201d said Shapiro. In an interview with the New York Post on Monday, Helen Comperatore, the widow of Corey Comperatore, shared her husband\u2019s last words, spoken as he shielded his family from bullets that ultimately took his life. \u201cHe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Helen Comperatore said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Get down!\u2019 That was the last thing he said.\u201d Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for years, told the Associated Press he counts Comperatore as a hero and intends to vote in the upcoming election in his memory. \u201cAs soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,\u201d Morehouse told the AP. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever voted and I think it will be in his memory.\u201d In addition to Comperatore, two people were critically injured in the incident, according to Pennsylvania State Police. David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania, are in stable condition, state police said Sunday in a news release. Dutch and Copenhaver are recovering at Allegheny General Hospital, according to hospital officials. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc. identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization\u2019s location in Westmoreland County. Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook Dutch underwent two surgeries after being \u201cshot in the liver and chest.\u201d \u201cThese victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\u201d said state police commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. \u201cThe Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\u201d The former president was shot in his right ear, he said on social media, leaving his face covered in blood. A GoFundMe campaign for the victims\u2019 families, verified by the fundraising platform, had raised more than $4.5 million by Monday evening, more than triple its initial goal. More than 59,000 donations have poured in, according to the website. A separate GoFundMe campaign for Comperatore\u2019s family, also verified by the platform, collected more than $1 million by Monday evening. That campaign, organized by a man who described himself as a neighbor and friend, had an initial goal of $7,000. Helen Comperatore told the New York Post she and Corey were childhood sweethearts and about to celebrate their 29th\u00a0wedding anniversary when the family headed to the rally to support Trump. \u201cMe and the kids were all there as a family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.\u201d Describing her late husband to the newspaper as a \u201csimple man,\u201d Helen Comperatore said he put \u201chis wife and kids first all the time.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t lift a finger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did everything.\u201d She also told the New York Post President Joe Biden did try to call, but she doesn\u2019t want to speak to him. \u201cMy husband was a devout Republican, and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.\u201d However, Helen Comperatore added she does not hold the current president responsible for what happened to her family. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ill-will towards Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump, that\u2019s who I\u2019m voting for, but I don\u2019t have ill-will towards Biden.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did,\u201d she continued. The family has not heard from the former president, she added. Speaking Sunday afternoon, Biden expressed his condolences to Comperatore\u2019s family. \u201cWe also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a father; he was protecting his family from the bullets being fired when he lost his life. God love him. We are also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured.\u201d A community in mourning The Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company hung Comperatore\u2019s uniform outside the fire station Sunday in a memorial to his life. \u201cOur company is dealing with a tragic loss that not only is affecting our members, but this community and Corey\u2019s family and friends,\u201d the fire company said on Facebook, also calling Comperatore \u201ca brother, son, husband, father and friend.\u201d Matthew Achilles, who lived near Comperatore, told CNN affiliate WTAE, \u201cHe was a real good guy. He really was. You hear stories all the time that it\u2019s always the good ones that end up getting taken out, and unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d \u201cHe helped us out when I was real sick a couple years ago. I was in the hospital and almost died. Corey was one of the first people to message me and say \u2018Hey, how can I help you,\u2019\u201d Achilles said. Bishop David Zubik of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh said in a statement, \u201cComperatore\u2019s selfless act in the face of danger speaks to his strength of character, deep faith, and dedication to serving others.\u201d \u201cLet us also take this moment to pray for unity and an end to violence and inflammatory rhetoric in our community and across our nation,\u201d he said. In the outpouring of sympathy, many have highlighted Comperatore\u2019s dedication to the community he served. \u201cCorey Comperatore died a hero, the way he lived, shielding his family from gunfire. He was a former\u00a0fire\u00a0chief, a proud father and loving husband.\u00a0We will pray for his family.\u00a0May he rest in peace,\u201d Robert\u00a0Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Fire Fighters Association, told CNN in a statement Sunday. The Buffalo Township Board of Supervisors condemned political violence in a statement to CNN Sunday. \u201cCorey was a dedicated husband, father, friend, and volunteer to the community, and will be sorely missed,\u201d the statement said. Shots fired, then \u2018a bloody scene\u2019 Witnesses have described a wave of chaos and terror that unfolded after the shooter, perched on a rooftop just outside the venue, fired several shots from an AR-style weapon. As shots rang out and the former president ducked below the podium, swarmed by Secret Service agents, attendees screamed and crouched toward the ground, video from the scene shows. \u201cIt was just the scariest thing, there was not a lot of places you could hide there,\u201d witness Amber DiFrischia told CNN. DiFrischia and her husband, Mike captured video of the moment the shooter fired his gun. The video shows the gunman laying on the rooftop with his weapon drawn, and eventually shows the gunman deceased. When the couple realized he had a gun, Amber said she immediately began yelling at officers and pointing to where he was located. The couple said many of the officers were too close to the building to see the gunman on the roof. Mike saw one officer attempt to climb onto the roof, but the officer eventually fell back to the ground. GOP Congressman Dan Meuser told CNN he was sitting in the front row of the rally with Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick and Republican Rep. Mike Kelly. He saw a man fatally shot \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them, he said. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from Grove City, Pennsylvania, told CNN he helped carry a man\u2019s body out of the stadium. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. He was to the far right of the podium, filming Trump\u2019s speech, when he heard the gunshots. \u201cJust as I was panning back, I heard seven gunshots in rapid succession, in under two or three seconds. I am familiar with guns, I knew immediately it was gunfire,\u201d Meyn told CNN. \u201cI saw him get hit.\u201d Meyn said he looked back in the direction the gunshots had come from. \u201cI saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head \u2026 there was a woman who was hit in the hand and forearm, a noncritical wound.\u201d He said he went over to see if he could render any aid, but another doctor was already tending to the woman who\u2019d been shot. \u201cI helped carry the body of the man out of the stands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers.\u201d Dr. Jim Sweetland,\u00a0a retired emergency room doctor, attempted to administer CPR on Comperatore. Sweetland told CNN he heard shots ring out and then \u201ca woman\u2019s voice cry out \u2018he\u2019s been shot. He\u2019s down.\u2019\u201d After performing CPR with the help of some bystanders, Sweetland looked up to see Comperatore\u2019s family and said the look on their faces \u201cis something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Sweetland said he wants to tell Comperatore\u2019s family, \u201cYour father died a hero.\u201d As he was leaving the rally, a combat vet stopped Sweetland and said, \u201cBrother, there\u2019s blood on your face, here\u2019s some water, you can wash your face off with it,\u201d the doctor recalled. \u201cThat was another American reaching out to help me after I tried to help Corey and to me that\u2019s what America is all about,\u201d he said. Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas said his nephew was also injured in the shooting. In an interview with Fox News, Jackson said his nephew \u201cwas grazed in the neck, a bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding.\u201d The congressman called it a \u201chorrific, horrific experience.\u201d Another attendee who witnessed the shooting described an atmosphere of \u201ccomplete shock.\u201d \u201cIt was too close for comfort,\u201d Donna Hutz told CNN. She and her son were just a few rows in front of the attendees who were shot. She looked up and saw the injured attendees with lots of blood covering the bleachers, she said. The shooting created shockwaves around the world, with international leaders including Biden, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Vatican condemning the attack and political violence more broadly. Authorities are still investigating both the shooter\u2019s possible motives and how he was able to access the area with a weapon. \u201cIt is surprising, but all the details of that will come out in the investigation,\u201d FBI Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said in a news conference when asked how the shooter was able to fire several shots. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_2024-campaign-transformed-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump will reemerge after an attempted assassination as an even greater mythical hero of his MAGA movement with the Republican National Convention opening Monday after an extraordinary two weeks that have transformed the 2024 campaign. More than 24 hours on, the horror of Saturday\u2019s shooting is only beginning to distill into a shocking new national trauma. But both the former president and President Joe Biden are gaming out how to navigate the political aftershocks. And there was another stunning development on Monday morning, when a district judge in Florida threw out special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s case regarding Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The shock move swept away one of the four criminal cases hanging over the ex-president in a huge victory for his campaign as the convention opens. It cements the notion that, apart from his hush money conviction in New York, he will not face legal accountability before November\u2019s election. The latest twist in Trump\u2019s legal dramas came as the country was still processing the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s horrific events. An assassination attempt against a presidential candidate, with all the historical allusions it evokes, raises fears that bloodshed will beget more bloodshed as the toxic politics of the last decade threaten to take an even more ominous turn. \u201cA former president was shot, an American citizen killed while simply exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot \u2014 must not \u2014 go down this road in America,\u201d Biden said, calling for calm and for a polarized nation to unite in an address from the Oval Office on Sunday night. The president mourned Corey Comperatore, a firefighter and father, who died at the Trump rally shielding his family and joined the haunting roll of Americans lost to political violence. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, joined calls for restraint, telling CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s a dark time in the history of the country. This is a dangerous time. And we\u2019ve been suggesting that all elected officials, from the president on down, really try to draw the country together. We need a unified message. We need to turn the temperature down.\u201d In his first interview since the attempt on his life, the former president pledged that his RNC keynote address Thursday \u2014 which had been expected to be an update on his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address in 2017 \u2014 would be a \u201clot different.\u201d \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,\u201d Trump told Salena Zito of the Washington Examiner. An earth-shaking two weeks since the CNN presidential debate has rescripted a race that had, for all its quirks, been a relatively stable grind between two unpopular candidates, neither of whom the public really wanted. Trump will show up to a convention in front of many followers who already saw him in almost a divine, superhuman light, having escaped a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet, to claim his third straight GOP nomination. The weekend\u2019s terrible events will only reinforce his control over his party. And pollsters\u00a0will be\u00a0watching to see whether sympathy over what happened swells his already broadening lead in swing states. Biden, meanwhile, spent the last two weeks fighting to save his own nomination, after his debate debacle in Atlanta exposed the 81-year-old\u2019s struggles with age and unleashed panic among Democrats that he\u2019ll hand Trump the White House and the GOP a monopoly on Washington power. The uproar over the Trump assassination attempt may pause\u00a0the intraparty\u00a0rebellion against Biden for now, especially as he assumes his role as the leader of a nation\u00a0in sudden crisis. Only the oldest Americans lived through the political assassinations of the 1960s, and those who remember the attempt to kill President Ronald Reagan in 1981 are now middle-aged. So, millions of people, who have already endured political paroxysms of recent years, are now experiencing the consequent and frightening sense of a nation off its axis for the first time. But despite the shock of the last few days, politics will always fill a vacuum \u2014 especially after a political tragedy. Indeed, Trump\u2019s defiance \u2014 he was pictured with blood streaking his face and clenching his fist while Secret Service rushed him offstage Saturday \u2014 was a gesture that is likely to define his career and his life. \u201cA lot of people say it\u2019s the most iconic photo they\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump told The New York Post on Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re right, and I didn\u2019t die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture.\u201d It is too early to say how voters will respond to the deeply disturbing events at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, or the sitting president\u2019s pledge that he\u2019s fit to serve until January 2029 despite his performance at the debate. But the decisions that each man makes in the coming days and the tone they seek to strike will be critical to how the campaign evolves. One thing about the election likely won\u2019t change. In a nation that was already deeply divided, the core vote for both Trump and Biden was probably locked in. Tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states probably still hold the fate of the White House \u2014 and the nation\u2019s future in their hands. Trump\u2019s tactical choices The convention, taking place in the home arena of the Milwaukee Bucks in the critical battleground state of Wisconsin, will formally nominate Trump in the fabled roll call of the states. And the GOP is on alert for him to name his vice presidential pick, after a reality show-style process in which he\u2019s teased out potential ticket mates, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The ex-president told supporters on Truth Social on Sunday that he\u2019d been planning to delay his trip to Wisconsin by two days, \u201cbut have just decided that I cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.\u201d Trump has conducted his attempt to regain the White House as a campaign of personal and political vengeance amid his claims that his legal cases, including his conviction in a hush money trial in New York and two pending trials over his attempt to thwart the will of voters in 2020, are proof of political persecution. There can be no justification for an assassination attempt on a candidate \u2014 an assault on democracy. But if the attack on Saturday sprung from a fetid political culture, Trump has been an enthusiastic participant with rhetoric that often seemed to incite violence and that coarsened the public square. This included his racist conspiracy theories about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama and apparent mockery of the injuries suffered by Paul Pelosi, the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was attacked with a hammer inside his home. The ex-president\u2019s summoning of protesters to Washington on January 6, 2021, and his call for them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d preceded the assault on the US Capitol and the beating of police officers by his supporters. Trump faces a choice. He could interpret the assassination attempt as a catalyst for less poisoned rhetoric. This could be a politically astute move at a time when many Americans are feeling frightened. His past conduct, however, would mean many voters would struggle to believe him. The alternative course would be to fit the assassination attempt into his claims of personal persecution by an amorphous \u201cleft\u201d that is seeking to crush his political ambitions, end his freedom through the courts and even take his life. (The motivation of the lone gunman who took aim at Trump is so far unclear as the investigations continues.) If Trump reacts to the assault on his life by vowing vengeance, the current political crisis and moment of national upheaval could worsen considerably. Many Republican politicians issued calls for calm and an easing of political rhetoric after the shooting \u2014 as did Democrats. But some GOP lawmakers also seemed to be using their comments to try to shut down criticism of a former president who sought to overturn the 2020 election and who has vowed to seek \u201cretribution\u201d in a second term. Vance, for instance, wrote on X that \u201cthe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.\u201d He added: \u201cthat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d \u00a0The choice of Vance for Trump\u2019s running mate would therefore send an unmistakable message. And Johnson accompanied his calls for calm by implying that Democrats\u00a0\u2014 in advancing their arguments against Trump \u2014 had somehow abetted the assassination attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s objective truth that Donald Trump is probably the most persecuted and attacked political figure in history, certainly among presidents, maybe at least since Abraham Lincoln, Civil War era,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cThat takes a toll, \u2026 When my colleagues go out and say, \u2018Democracy will end, the republic will be in an emergency stage if Donald Trump wins for president,\u2019 it\u2019s just not true.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen they say that kind of rhetoric and they heat it up like that, there are people out there that take these things to heart and act upon them.\u201d Biden\u2019s new political challenge \u2014 and opening Biden now faces one of the most intricate tests of presidential dexterity for years. He is embracing his duty to protect political discourse \u2014 even that of an opponent \u2014 and has called for an investigation of apparent Secret Service failings in the attack. At the same time, he\u2019s trying to revive his own political fortunes by looking presidential, while still taking on Trump. Biden\u2019s flexing of the symbolic power of the office \u2014 and the spotlight on the Republican National Convention this week \u2014 may serve to blunt attention on Democratic anxieties about his prospects, although all it would take to revive public concerns would be more alarmingly shaky public performances. His Oval Office address, while moving, was marked by several of the verbal flubs that Trump has mercilessly mocked and that after the debate disaster have turned every public event into an excruciating examination of his capacity. Biden now faces the difficult decision about when to return to the offensive against Trump \u2014 one that may be conditioned by the tone his rival adopts. But he subtly signaled during his Oval Office address that he will not water down his warnings that his predecessor and possible successor represents a threat to democratic freedoms that define the soul of America. He did so by citing several events in which Trump, his supporters or far-right groups were involved \u2014 mentioning \u201cmembers of Congress of both parties being targeted and shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or \u2026 intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor (Michigan Democrat Gretchen Whitmer) or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever,\u201d Biden said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_private-efforts-biden-step-aside", "text": "The public calls from Democrats asking President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race have quieted in recent days, but private efforts to nudge the president and his top aides continue, several Democratic sources told CNN. Among the efforts, these sources say, are repeated memos from a seasoned and respected Democratic pollster, Stanley Greenberg, sharing his take that Biden is on track to lose the election \u2013 and in a way that does deep damage to other Democratic candidates. \u201cLose everything,\u201d is how one Democrat described a polling memo Greenberg sent to Biden\u2019s inner circle in recent days. \u201cDevastating,\u201d was the one word answer of a second Democrat close to the White House who is familiar with the Greenberg memos. These sources said Greenberg has sent several memos over the past two weeks since the president\u2019s devastating debate performance, analyzing internal polling he asserts shows the president\u2019s position continues to deteriorate because Americans overwhelmingly do not see him as up to serving four more years. Greenberg has been a leading Democratic pollster for decades and his work includes advising Bill Clinton\u2019s two winning presidential campaigns. He declined to comment when contacted Monday evening. Several Democratic members of Congress also have continued to lobby privately, these sources said, urging top Biden advisers to consider the damage to Biden\u2019s legacy if the president not only loses the White House but Republicans hold the House and capture the Senate majority. One Democratic lawmaker told CNN some top Biden aides get \u201cthe depth of this\u201d but believe it can be turned around and in any event describe the president as adamant in the belief he can win. In his NBC News interview Monday, for example, the president again made clear he has no intention of stepping aside. The lawmaker\u2019s view was that it was counterproductive to make additional public calls for Biden to step aside right now, because of the imperative of a unified party response to this week\u2019s Republican convention and because of the president\u2019s repeated public statements about staying in the race. But this Democrat predicted that approach would change if the polling and other data after the GOP convention showed the president\u2019s standing deteriorating more.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/private-efforts-biden-step-aside/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_what-to-watch-rnc", "text": "After surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump will be at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week to accept his third consecutive GOP presidential nomination. A gathering already marked by one kind of uncertainty, with Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick still a mystery, will now take place under the shadow of one of the most shocking acts of political violence in modern American history. It\u2019s unclear what effect the bloodshed will have on what had been expected to be a week of pomp and prime-time speeches designed to make the GOP\u2019s best case for Trump and a Republican majority on Capitol Hill. Trump, though, has already promised the show will go on \u2013 at the Fiserv Forum and Wisconsin Center District, Milwaukee\u2019s convention center campus \u2013 and that he is \u201clook(ing) forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin.\u201d Here are six things to watch: What will change because of Saturday\u2019s shooting? Many of the questions that predated Saturday evening\u2019s assassination attempt have largely faded into the background as Trump, President Joe Biden and their respective allies rush to adapt their campaigns to the new landscape. It\u2019s not yet clear how this contest has been altered, but what begins on Monday with the delegate roll call and concludes Thursday night with the former president\u2019s nomination acceptance speech, clearly marks the start of something new and fraught. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s going to be a whole different speech now,\u201d Trump told the Washington Examiner of his convention speech following the assassination attempt. \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would\u2019ve been two days ago,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s return to the stage, which could come earlier in the week, and his rhetoric at the podium will set the tone both for the final months of the presidential campaign and the near-term future of American politics. The former president has, so far, been restrained in his response to the attempt on his life. Other members of his party have not, with some immediately suggesting \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the alleged gunman was driven to act by heated campaign rhetoric. Trump\u2019s campaign leadership has also said, in a Sunday memo, that it will not tolerate violent rhetoric. How the presumptive GOP nominee decides to translate his feelings could spark an already crackling tinderbox \u2013 or, if he seeks to turn down the temperature, further add to the conundrum for his rivals, who are unsure of how \u2013 and when \u2013 to resume their campaign against Trump. For now, though, the ball is very much in the former president\u2019s court. What the hosts are saying Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming told reporters on Sunday that, as of now, there are no major changes on tap for the convention or its schedule. \u201cIf they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don\u2019t see any reason for it right now,\u201d Schimming said. Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick is still slated to speak on Wednesday, followed by Trump on Thursday. The slate of speakers is unchanged. Schimming said he spoke to RNC Chairman Michael Whatley earlier in the day and \u201ceverything for the\u00a0convention\u00a0is going on as planned.\u201d \u201cWe have dozens and dozens of speakers that will be speaking not only to the folks here, but to people across the nation and across the world about what Donald Trump\u2019s gonna bring to this country,\u201d Schimming continued. \u201cWe want to make America great again, and the way to do it is to have a unified\u00a0convention\u00a0here in Milwaukee.\u201d VP: Who\u2019s it gonna be? The decision has been made, Trump recently said, \u201cin my mind.\u201d But for just about everyone else, it remains a mystery. CNN\u00a0previously\u00a0reported that the Trump campaign viewed Monday, July 15, as its deadline for naming a running mate. That is, of course, the first day of the convention. The potential for a made-for-TV unveiling is there \u2013 and it\u2019s likely down to three people: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The timeline, though, could be thrown off by the shocking attempt on Trump\u2019s life this weekend in Pennsylvania. The former president, before the Butler County rally, was using the announcement as a tool for drawing out small-dollar donors and media attention. Both are now keenly attuned, no matter whom Trump picks for the ticket, possibly changing his calculus. The Trump campaign previously said its \u201ctop criteria in selecting a vice president is a strong leader who will make a great president for eight years after his next four-year term concludes.\u201d Does that rule out Burgum, the only senior citizen in the trio of favorites? Rubio and Vance are younger, but the job description might be different today than it was yesterday. One piece of evidence the pick was, at the very least, nearing? According to copies of the invitations, the Trump team has scheduled two large donor events during RNC week in Milwaukee featuring his as-yet-unknown running mate. Will MAGA make a case to the moderates? The better question here might be: Do Trump and his MAGA crew want to win over fence-sitting Republicans who, as an example, voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primaries? They want the votes, of course, but what\u2019s less clear is whether the former president and current GOP leadership are willing tone down their message in an effort to bring in moderate, suburban voters. To that end, Haley has indeed been invited to speak. How the party, more broadly, addresses hot-button issues like abortion is more of a question mark. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a social conservative, has already expressed concern over too soft a stance. Democrats will, for all the other issues at play, be hoping for some fire and brimstone from conservatives like North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson. A handful of 2024 rivals-turned-supporters are scheduled to speak. Among them: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose campaign fizzled after a second-place showing in Iowa. Other 2024 contenders, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Burgum, who have aligned themselves closely with Trump and are on the list of potential vice presidential picks, are also likely to be on hand. Presidential conventions are generally geared toward reaching \u2013 via television \u2013 the broadest possible spectrum of potential voters. Trump, though, is more inclined to tweak his political rivals than offer them an olive branch. For almost 10 years now, since he entered the presidential arena in 2015, political strategists and pundits have been asking if Trump \u2013 first as a candidate, then as president, and now, again, as a candidate \u2013 might saw off the roughest edges of his persona in a bid to attract swing voters. He\u2019s done so, on occasion, for brief periods of time. That\u2019s been his tone since the assassination attempt. Which path he\u2019ll choose for this convention \u2013 and whether he and his allies can maintain it for a full week \u2013 is harder to predict. Family reunion The family is very much back in focus. Back in 2016, Trump\u2019s children all spoke to the convention and were, in large part, viewed as bright-eyed validators for his candidacy. Four years later, they mostly took a more aggressive tone. This time around is more difficult to peg. Their words will take on greater meaning, too, as Republicans look to Trump\u2019s innermost circle for guidance about how to react to the shooting in Pennsylvania. The public view of Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Boulos (n\u00e9e Trump) has changed over the past eight years. Trump\u2019s eldest sons have emerged as vocal supporters of his right-wing politics. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is now the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Though Ivanka, who worked in Trump\u2019s White House, and Tiffany have been quieter, both are expected to be in Milwaukee. As will former first lady Melania Trump, though it is unclear whether she will speak. She released a lengthy statement following the Pennsylvania rally asking Americans to \u201cascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.\u201d The former first lady has maintained a low profile throughout her husband\u2019s latest campaign, having attended just two public appearances since Trump launched his third presidential bid \u2014 the kickoff of his campaign in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home and a brief appearance in March when she accompanied Trump to vote in the Florida presidential primary. More recently, she announced that their son, 18-year-old Barron Trump, will not be a delegate to the convention despite his being voted into the role in Florida. The \u2018Project 2025\u2019 tap dance Trump has publicly distanced himself from Project 2025, a far-reaching, 900-page conservative blueprint for the next Republican president to purge and remake the federal government and\u00a0implement new restrictions. However, that blueprint has become the focal point of Democratic attacks on what a second Trump term could look like \u2014 and for good reason: CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno found that at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d the project\u2019s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. Whether Trump and his allies address Project 2025 or its most politically incendiary proposals, which are certain to feature in Democratic advertisements this fall, could offer a preview of much of the rest of the campaign. Trump has attracted a devoted following from his party\u2019s most conservative members \u2014 and handed them a victory they\u2019d sought for decades when the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority, with three Trump-appointed justices, overturned Roe v. Wade\u2019s national abortion protections. But he has sought to distance himself from those figures and put their policy beliefs at arm\u2019s length as he approaches a general election in which he\u2019ll need to win over moderate suburban voters with little appetite for conservative culture wars. Another example: The panel charged with crafting and producing a platform for the Republican National Committee adopted a scaled-back document that softened language on abortion and same-sex marriage. That document will be taken up at this week\u2019s convention. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_fact-check-joe-biden-nato-press-conference", "text": "President Joe Biden\u00a0held a solo news conference\u00a0on Thursday after a NATO summit in Washington, seeking to reassure voters concerned about his ability to serve and Democratic officials concerned about his ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Biden\u2019s comments included some false and misleading claims. Here is a fact check. Biden\u2019s Putin-Zelensky gaffe moment Biden played down a gaffe he made at an event earlier on Thursday in which he had mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d before correcting himself\u00a0moments later. Biden said at the press conference: \u201cI said, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, Zelensky.\u2019 And then I added five other names.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s last claim was false. He didn\u2019t utter \u201cfive other names\u201d after he corrected the Putin-Zelensky mix-up. In fact,\u00a0after Biden corrected himself, Zelensky said he is \u201cbetter\u201d than Putin, Biden agreed, and then Zelensky delivered remarks as Biden stood silently beside him. Biden\u2019s travels Biden spoke of a need to \u201cpace\u201d himself in his activities. He said, \u201cThe next debate, I\u2019m not going to be traveling 15 time zones a week before. Anyway. That\u2019s what it was about.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading. Biden did not travel abroad \u201ca week before\u201d the June 27\u00a0CNN presidential\u00a0debate in which he performed poorly. In fact, he returned to the US from Europe\u00a012 days before that debate, on June 15. Biden\u00a0attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles on June 15, returned to the White House on June 16\u00a0and\u00a0went to Camp David on June 20\u00a0for intensive debate preparations. He stayed at Camp David until the day of the CNN\u00a0presidential\u00a0debate against Trump, which was held in Atlanta. What Trump said about NATO Biden, criticizing Trump\u2019s position on the NATO military alliance, said, \u201cI think he said at one of his rallies, don\u2019t hold me to this, recently, where, \u2018NATO \u2013 I just learned about NATO,\u2019 or something to that effect. Foreign policy\u2019s never been his strong point.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s comment was indeed inaccurate. Trump did not say at a recent rally that \u201cI just learned about NATO.\u201d Rather, Trump said at the rally that he had not known what NATO was, \u201ctoo much,\u201d prior\u00a0to attending his first alliance summit as president in 2017.\u00a0 Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at his Tuesday rally in Florida: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be obnoxious because I felt, you know, it was the first time I\u2019d ever done this. I went; I didn\u2019t even know what the hell NATO was too much before, but it didn\u2019t take me long to figure it out. Like about two minutes. And the first thing I figured out was they weren\u2019t paying.\u201d (Trump\u00a0continued\u00a0by making his\u00a0usual false claims\u00a0about NATO\u2019s funding structure.) Biden is entitled to criticize Trump for this profession of prior ignorance about NATO or for his continued inaccuracy about NATO, but Biden\u2019s comments made it sound like Trump had acknowledged he had just learned about NATO\u00a0now\u00a0rather than seven years ago. Hamas and the West Bank Talking about the war between Israel and Hamas, Biden said Thursday, \u201cThere is a growing dissatisfaction in, on the West Bank, from the Palestinians, about Hamas. Hamas is not popular now.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0The limited available public opinion polling suggests the claim that \u201cHamas is not popular now\u201d in the West Bank is not true \u2013 and that Hamas\u2019 popularity has\u00a0increased there\u00a0since its attack on Israel last October.\u00a0 A\u00a0poll taken in late May and early June by a well-known pollster based in the West Bank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, found that 73% of respondents in the West Bank supported the October attack by Hamas, that 82% of respondents in the West Bank\u00a0were satisfied with Hamas\u2019 performance in the current war with Israel and that 71% of respondents in the West Bank\u00a0preferred Hamas to control the Gaza Strip after the war. Hamas scored better on all of those questions among the respondents in the West Bank than it did among the respondents in Gaza. In addition, Hamas had the support of\u00a0about half the West Bank respondents\u00a0who said they would vote\u00a0in hypothetical parliamentary elections \u2013 double its support level in a poll nine months prior and more than double West Bank respondents\u2019 support in the latest poll for more moderate rival Fatah. Biden\u2019s endorsement from the United Auto Workers When a reporter told Biden that Reuters had reported Thursday that the leadership of the United Auto Workers union was concerned about Biden\u2019s ability to win the election, Biden responded, \u201cUAW just endorsed me, but go ahead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that the UAW \u201cjust\u201d endorsed him is misleading at best. The UAW actually\u00a0announced its endorsement of Biden on January 24, more than five months ago. In other words, Biden attempted to dismiss the\u00a0reported post-debate concerns of UAW president Shawn Fain\u00a0by insinuating that Fain\u2019s union had made a recent decision to back Biden. But the endorsement actually came long before the debate and the resulting crisis of confidence among some of Biden\u2019s pre-debate backers. The war in Afghanistan Biden spoke of how he had encouraged Israeli leaders not to \u201coccupy anywhere\u201d and instead target the Hamas terrorists who attacked their country, avoiding the mistakes the US made after it was attacked on September 11, 2001. Biden said, \u201cYou may recall, I still get criticized for it, but I was totally opposed to the occupation and trying to unite Afghanistan. Once we got bin Laden,\u201d in 2011, \u201cwe should\u2019ve moved on, because it was not in our \u2013 no one\u2019s ever going to unite that country.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that he was \u201ctotally opposed to the occupation\u201d of Afghanistan is misleading at best. In the early years of the war, Biden, then a US senator for Delaware, was a vocal public supporter of the US having a sustained military presence in Afghanistan and engaging in extensive \u201cnation-building\u201d there \u2013 and he explicitly rejected the idea of a narrow military mission targeting terrorists. Biden did eventually change his mind,\u00a0becoming\u00a0a\u00a0sharp internal critic\u00a0of the war as President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president beginning in 2009; he\u00a0opposed\u00a0Obama\u2019s\u00a0\u201csurge\u201d of additional troops\u00a0into the country. But Biden\u00a0has\u00a0repeatedly suggested\u00a0he always opposed the idea of a US military presence and nation-building\u00a0efforts\u00a0in Afghanistan, and that\u2019s incorrect. In an\u00a0October 2001 speech in the Senate, Biden outlined a broad agenda for a \u201clong-term solution\u201d in Afghanistan, which he said would involve everything from \u201cthe restoration of women\u2019s rights\u201d to \u201cbuilding basic infrastructure\u201d to the \u201ccreation of secular schools\u201d to the establishment of a \u201ccrop substitution program for narcotics\u201d \u2013 and said that it would be unwise to simply go after terrorists. He said, \u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. If we think only in the short term, only of getting bin Laden and the Taliban \u2013 which we must do, but that is not all we must do \u2013 we are just begging for greater trouble down the line.\u201d In a speech in February 2002, after the Taliban regime was ousted, Biden\u00a0said, \u201cLike it or not, our leadership role must include soldiers on the ground, in my view. If others step forward and we are not needed on the ground, fine. But whatever it takes, we are going to have to be sure that there is a robust security force not only in Kabul but in every major municipal center in that country if there\u2019s any prospect of transitioning to a government that is stable two years down the road, has a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of succeeding, and is able to transition into a military and a police force that is a basic necessity for governance there.\u201d He continued: \u201cHistory is going to judge us very harshly, I believe, if we allow the hope of a liberated Afghanistan to evaporate because we are fearful of the phrase \u2018nation-building\u2019 or we do not stay the course.\u201d And in\u00a0comments\u00a0on Afghanistan at a February 2003\u00a0meeting of the Senate\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Relations\u00a0Committee, Biden said, \u201cIn some parts of this [President George W. Bush] administration, \u2018nation-building\u2019 is a dirty phrase. But the alternative to nation-building is chaos \u2013 a chaos that churns out bloodthirsty warlords, drug traffickers, and terrorists. We\u2019ve seen it happen in Afghanistan before, and we\u2019re watching it happen in Afghanistan today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/fact-check-joe-biden-nato-press-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_political-violence-analysis", "text": "The motivations of the gunman who opened fire at former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania on Saturday are not known, but the incident comes at a time of political anger and anxiety in a country split down the middle and bursting at the seams. Violence has targeted Republicans, Democrats, conservatives and liberals, and seems to be happening with agonizing frequency. \u25ba A plot to assassinate conservative Supreme Court justices was foiled in 2022 by the FBI. \u25ba The husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attacked by a hammer-wielding intruder at their San Francisco home in 2022. \u25ba A violent mob stormed the US Capitol in January of 2021 to interrupt the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win. \u25ba Would-be kidnappers hatched a plot to snatch Michigan\u2019s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 and were sentenced on terrorism charges. \u25ba A GOP congressional baseball team practice was attacked by a gunman in Alexandria, Virginia, in 2017. The then-House GOP Whip, Steve Scalise, was nearly killed. Those incidents range from organized plots to the irrational actions of lone attackers, but they all feed off a desperate and intractable polarization in which apocalyptic language is used to demonize both sides of the political aisle. A major question will be how Trump reacts The Republican National Convention is set to get underway Monday in Milwaukee. Will Trump use the shooting to further feed the idea among his supporters that the country needs to be taken back, or will the former president, who doesn\u2019t believe he lost the last election, call for calm? Americans need to treat this assassination attempt like 9/11 and unify, according to Ian Bremmer, the president of the political risk firm the Eurasia Group. But there is another direction that is more frightening. \u201cI fear it\u2019s going to be a lot\u00a0more like January 6, where there\u00a0will be a large number of\u00a0people that will weaponize what\u00a0just happened. And that we will\u00a0continue to tribalize as a\u00a0country and people won\u2019t accept\u00a0that the people on the other\u00a0side of the aisle are\u00a0American,\u201d Bremmer told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria. In the shocking chaos of the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Trump was encouraging supporters to \u201cfight.\u201d Trump yelled to supporters, pumping his fist, as blood dripped from his head when the Secret Service rushed him from the rally stage. Later, on his social media platform, the presumptive GOP nominee called for national unity. \u201cIn this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,\u201d he said. As the gravity of the situation sank in Saturday night, over-the-top rhetoric was on hold, replaced by bipartisan condemnation of political violence and calls to cool things down. In a statement, Biden condemned political violence and called the attack on Trump \u201csick,\u201d while his advisers halted television advertising and put active campaigning on hold. Blaming anti-Trump rhetoric Scalise, now the House majority leader, issued a statement blaming anti-Trump rhetoric, which he said is \u201cfueling ludicrous hysteria that Donald Trump winning re-election would be the end of democracy in America.\u201d \u201cClearly we\u2019ve seen far left lunatics act on violent rhetoric in the past. This incendiary rhetoric must stop,\u201d he added. One of Trump\u2019s potential running mates, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, issued a statement Saturday night, before the identity of the suspected shooter had been released or his motivation was known, blaming political opposition to Trump, and the Biden campaign\u2019s rhetoric specifically, for the shooting. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance said on X. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Trump\u2019s election would not break the country. \u201cYou know, if he wins, democracy is not going to end. He\u2019s not a fascist.\u00a0He represents a point of view that millions share,\u201d Graham said. Calls to calm down Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday that \u201cthe greatest threat to America is that we\u2019re horribly divided.\u201d He said Americans need to spend less time on social media, where divisions grow, and more time out in their communities focused on the things that unite them. Sen. John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania Democrat, noted on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Tree of Life Synagogue was attacked in 2018 in nearby Pittsburgh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in that place. It\u2019s the same kind of shock,\u201d Fetterman said. Cycles of political violence \u2018bred in the bone\u2019 The presidential historian Tim Naftali said on CNN that there have been other cycles of violence against presidential candidates in US politics \u2014 frequently at times of social change, including 1968, when Robert F. Kennedy and Marin Luther King, Jr., were shot. He said political violence is \u201cbred in the bone\u201d of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s something we ought to\u00a0remember \u2014 we are capable of this\u00a0as a nation,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe people who do\u00a0it, of course, are outliers,\u00a0but they are a product of the\u00a0extremism and the anger and the\u00a0hatred that sometime pulses\u00a0through our elections.\u201d The gunman, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had apparently been a registered Republican, and would only this year have been old enough to vote in a presidential election. His name is also associated with a $15 donation to a progressive political action committee. The FBI has been warning about the terror threat posed by domestic violent extremists in recent years. Last December, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned of the threat of lone actors as a top domestic threat to the homeland. Not all attacks on politicians are politically motivated John Hinckley was mentally unstable, seeking fame and to impress a Hollywood actress, when he tried to kill President Ronald Reagan in 1981. But the recent string of violent incidents falls into a definite period of division and anger. The Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson said on CNN that Americans across the board are angry and frustrated. \u201cI look at data all\u00a0the time that says Americans\u00a0are getting angrier and angrier\u00a0about what\u2019s going on in this\u00a0country, that they are getting\u00a0more and more frustrated that\u00a0they think traditional ways of\u00a0solving problems are no longer\u00a0working,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/political-violence-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_joe-biden-trump-campaign", "text": "President Joe Biden and his campaign are facing an abrupt pivot point: After spending the last two weeks trying to salvage the president\u2019s reelection bid, they are now grappling with a delicate national moment following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign and Democrats across the party scrambled Sunday to determine how to adjust their plans to counter messaging at the Republican National Convention, which had been in the works for some time. \u201cThe big issue is how to campaign against him or attack him,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN. \u201cCan we even do that this week?\u201d The adviser said discussions were underway to calibrate jabs and criticism aimed at Trump to focus on policy differences, rather than personal attacks. Plans that had been underway for weeks to respond to the GOP convention are being reviewed and potentially adjusted. In the hours following the attempted assassination, which killed one spectator and injured two others, both Biden and Trump called for unity. In a rare Oval Office address Sunday night, Biden called on the country to \u201clower the temperature in our politics.\u201d \u201cWhile we disagree,\u201d Biden said, \u201cwe are not enemies. We\u2019re neighbors.\u201d Hours before the shooting at the Trump rally, Biden had been trying to assuage concerns among members of his own party by participating in calls with key groups of lawmakers \u2013 some of whom were still unconvinced about his viability as a candidate. But the campaign\u2019s focus took a sudden turn as news of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, took hold. Stunned Biden campaign officials huddled\u00a0and decided to pause all outbound\u00a0communications and pull\u00a0down TV\u00a0ads. The campaign urged\u00a0staff in a memo to\u00a0\u201crefrain from issuing any comments on social media or in public.\u201d Sources described the mood within the White House and the Biden campaign as \u201cshock\u201d as they put their response into motion. The president was attending mass in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware \u2013 where he has a residence \u2013 at the time the shots rang out. He briefly addressed the nation hours after \u2013 a choice he made shortly after being briefed on the incident, according to a source familiar with the matter. \u201cWe cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this,\u201d he said. Biden then returned to the White House late Saturday, ditching plans to remain in Rehoboth for the weekend. The Biden campaign has yet to decide when to resume its advertising campaign against Trump after pulling the ads on Saturday. But that, a separate Democratic strategist said, was the easy decision. A harder question is how and when to resume, with 114 days until the election. Chief among the difficulties for the Biden camp will be recalibrating a message that\u2019s appropriate for the moment after a month when the team directed more forceful rhetoric against Biden\u2019s predecessor, especially on his criminal conviction. Sen. Chris\u00a0Coons, a close Biden ally and co-chair of the Biden reelection campaign, called for a lowering of the political temperature. \u201cWe have to reduce the rhetoric and the tone. I\u2019d urge folks to turn off their phones and get off of social media today. And take some time with your family and reflect on who we are as a nation and who we want to be,\u201d the Delaware senator said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The president briefly addressed reporters Sunday afternoon, his second time appearing in front of cameras since the shooting, and announced he would be speaking a third time later in the evening from the Oval Office. The president urged people not to make assumptions and to \u201clet the FBI do their job,\u201d stressing that the shooter\u2019s motivations were still being investigated. He emphasized that Trump \u201calready received a heightened level of security\u201d in his capacity as both a former president and the presumptive Republican Party nominee, and noted that he has \u201cbeen consistent in my direction to the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability, protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety.\u201d Biden added that he has ordered the Secret Service to review its plans for the Republican National Convention that begins on Monday. He\u2019s also ordered an independent review of the security at Saturday\u2019s rally to discover how the attempted assassination was able to take place. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence or any violence for that matter. An assassination attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation,\u201d Biden said, sending his condolences to the family of the man who was killed at the rally and his well wishes to Trump. \u201cUnity is the most elusive goal of all, but nothing is important as that right now. We\u2019ll debate and we\u2019ll disagree. That\u2019s not going to change. But it\u2019s going \u2013 we\u2019re not going to lose sight of the fact who we are as Americans.\u201d In the Oval Office later Sunday, Biden reiterated his belief that the stakes in the upcoming election \u201care incredibly high.\u201d But the president added: \u201cPolitics must never be a literal battlefield, and God forbid, a killing field.\u201d The attempted assassination of Biden\u2019s opponent also challenges two central\u00a0goals\u00a0of his presidency and candidacy:\u00a0To heal a politically fraught nation and to restore faith in America\u2019s democracy. Around the world,\u00a0condemnation of the shooting came from Canada to China to the Kremlin, as allies and adversaries alike watched the US\u2019 deep divisions on display. Biden has pitched the race as the decision between the continuation and possible destruction of democracy in the United States. That rhetoric will now be closely examined in the aftermath of the attack, including comments that the president made in a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. While public calls for Biden to step aside following his poor debate performance two weeks ago have cooled in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the concerns voiced directly to the president in calls on Saturday have hardly gone away. A White House official said Sunday the president would continue his outreach to lawmakers and supporters but would turn his immediate focus to his presidential duties of directing the government\u2019s response to the first assassination attempt of a former president or presidential candidate in more than four decades. Over the course of Sunday morning, the president and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by senior homeland security and local law enforcement officials, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. As Biden\u2019s top advisers briefed him in the Situation Room on the shooting, the president\u2019s political team was grappling with whether planned travel to Nevada should proceed, according to an official. The White House announced Biden was postponing a planned trip to Texas on Monday. Biden is also set to be interviewed by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt for a primetime special airing Monday evening. Harris has already postponed a planned trip to Florida in response to the assassination attempt, according to a Biden-Harris campaign official. She originally planned on traveling to Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday for a moderated conversation alongside Republican women to discuss Trump\u2019s stance on women\u2019s reproductive rights. After being briefed on the incident on Saturday, the vice president denounced the \u201csenseless\u201d shooting and said she is relieved Trump was not seriously injured.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_kim-cheatle-secret-service-trump-assassination-attempt", "text": "In her first public statement since the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday said the agency will \u201cparticipate fully\u201d in an independent review ordered by President Joe Biden and also said the agency will work with Congress on \u201cany oversight action.\u201d Cheatle, who was appointed by Biden in 2022, expressed confidence in the agency\u2019s security plan for this week\u2019s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and said changes have been made to Trump\u2019s security detail since Saturday. \u201cThe Secret Service is tasked with the tremendous responsibility of protecting the current and former leaders of our democracy,\u201d Cheatle said. \u201cIt is a responsibility that I take incredibly seriously, and I am committed to fulfilling that mission.\u201d Questions have swirled about the agency\u2019s preparations in the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s shooting, which wounded the former president, killed an attendee and left two people critically injured. The shooter, identified by authorities as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, also was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene. Among the concerns and questions is how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president\u2019s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Notably, the shooter\u2019s location was outside the security perimeter, raising questions about both the size of the perimeter and efforts to sweep and secure the American Glass Research building, and how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access. A spokesman for the United States Secret Service told CNN the agency did not sweep the building where Crooks shot at Trump but instead leaned on local law enforcement to conduct security at that location. The spokesman added that there was supposed to be local law enforcement posted in that area, but it is not clear where that post was supposed to be located.\u00a0A source not directly involved but with knowledge of Secret Service operations described possible roaming posts, for example, as part of some operational plans. The Secret Service regularly works with local law enforcement agencies to assist with securing events, as is the case in Milwaukee. Further, the Secret Service utilized two local counter-sniper teams during Trump\u2019s rally, in addition to two Secret Service counter-sniper teams. The spokesman did not know at the time of CNN\u2019s inquiry which local agency should have been responsible for the building. A source familiar with the investigation says one of the two local counter-sniper teams was supposed to cover the building where the gunman was perched, noting that it was a designated post in the operational plan. Meanwhile, additional details about the shooting continued to emerge Monday morning, with a senior law enforcement official saying the shooter purchased\u00a050\u00a0rounds\u00a0of ammunition at a local gun store just hours before carrying out his attack. Biden said Sunday he has directed Cheatle to review all security measures for the RNC as well as an independent review into Saturday\u2019s rally shooting \u201cto assess exactly what happened. He pledged to publicly release the results of that inquiry. Law enforcement sources\u00a0say that part of the aftermath will include a review of\u00a0whether the Secret Service had enough assets to protect Trump days ahead of\u00a0officially becoming the Republican presidential nominee\u00a0and whether procedures were followed to conduct security sweeps of the building that offered a vantage point for the alleged shooter. Congress demands answers Republican and Democratic lawmakers are already demanding answers from the agency on the security posture and hearings on the incident. The Senate Homeland Security Committee is opening a bipartisan investigation into the shooting, chairman Gary Peters said Monday, and it hopes to \u201cexpedite\u201d the process and hold hearings before the Senate leaves for August recess. The Michigan Democrat said the committee will use its investigation into the security failures at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201ctemplate\u201d for this new effort. In the House, Speaker Mike\u00a0Johnson\u00a0vowed a \u201cfull investigation\u201d of the shooting, featuring testimony from USSS, DHS and the FBI, and two Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee have also called for an investigation. Rep. Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, on Sunday called for an independent commission, in the style of the one that investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, \u201cto give a non-partisan examination into the\u00a0how\u00a0and\u00a0why\u00a0aspects of this security posture.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, appearing on CNN Monday morning, acknowledged that Saturday\u2019s incident was a security \u201cfailure.\u201d \u201cWe are going to analyze through\u00a0an independent review how that occurred, why it occurred and make recommendations and findings to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_senate-seat-ohio-jd-vance", "text": "The Senate is narrowly divided and Democrats hold a slim majority. But there\u2019s no need for Ohio Sen. JD Vance, whom former President Donald Trump selected as his running mate Monday, to leave the chamber during the campaign. It makes sense to look to a senator as vice president: The role\u2019s main official duty is to serve as president of the US Senate, although recent vice presidents don\u2019t tend to spend too much time on Capitol Hill. In fact, there is a long history of presidential candidates selecting senators as running mates. President Joe Biden was at the end of a long career as a US senator from Delaware when he was tapped as then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008.\u00a0Biden and Obama both continued to serve in the Senate during the campaign, as did Sen. John McCain, the Arizonan who was Republicans\u2019 pick that year. Biden picked then-Sen. Kamala Harris as his own running mate in 2020. In 2016, Hillary Clinton picked Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate. Kaine never gave up his seat and went back to serving as a senator after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump.\u00a0In 2004, then-Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat, picked then-Sen. John Edwards as his running mate. So what does that mean for the seat? Usually, when a senator is elected as either president or vice president, they will resign from their Senate seat in early January after the election. Biden, however, is an outlier in this. He kept his Senate seat longer than most in early 2009, perhaps so that he could\u00a0edge past some other former senators\u00a0in the all-time Senate tenure list.\u00a0Biden sits\u00a0at No. 19. Vance\u00a0won his seat\u00a0in the Senate in 2022 and won\u2019t be up for reelection as a senator until 2028. If he and Trump win in November, Vance would need to resign before taking the oath of office on January 20. It would then fall to Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, himself a former senator, to appoint a replacement until the\u00a0next regular state election, when there would be a special election to fill the rest of the term. This can be a fraught process. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich went to federal prison for essentially trying to trade away the appointment to fill out Obama\u2019s term. For Biden, longtime aide and friend Ted Kaufman was appointed in 2009 to succeed him in the Senate. Kaufman did not run for the seat in his own right. California Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Sen. Alex Padilla to succeed Harris in the Senate, and Padilla has since been elected to the seat.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/senate-seat-ohio-jd-vance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_what-happened-trump-assassination-attempt", "text": "Former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s rally speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday evening began just as it had at dozens of rallies previously \u2013 his attendees chanted \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and Trump clapped and pointed to faces in the crowd before taking the lectern. About 150 yards to the north of the former president, a gunman was climbing onto the roof of a building\u00a0outside the rally security perimeter. He had an AR-style weapon with him. Six minutes into the former president\u2019s speech, the gunman took aim at Trump and squeezed the trigger. What happened next was as miraculous as it was historic. The gunman, later identified by the FBI as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired multiple shots, including one that Trump said skimmed his ear. Trump ducked to the ground. Five Secret Service agents rushed to the stage and covered the former president, as the pop-pop from another two additional bursts of gunfire rang out across the Butler Farm Show grounds. Forty-three seconds after the first shot was fired, a Secret Service agent said the shooter was down. Trump, his ear and face bloodied, was brought to his feet. He raised his fist in a defiant and iconic pose to his supporters to let them know he was OK before agents took him off the stage and into his SUV. At least three rally attendees were shot, one of whom was killed. The incident is being investigated as an assassination attempt. It is the first time since 1981, when John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan,\u00a0that a current or former president has been shot at. It\u2019s still too soon to determine what security failures may have occurred, such as how the shooter was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump. Attendees have helped to fill in some details, including chaos in the immediate aftermath of the gunfire and suspicions about the gunman before he scaled the roof of the building just outside the rally site \u2013 transforming an ordinary political event into both an extraordinary moment in American politics and a deadly crime scene. \u2018Security seemed tight\u2019 Large crowds had flocked to the show grounds in the small city of Butler, some 30 miles north of Pittsburgh, to glimpse the former president at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention begins\u00a0on Monday. For weeks, the nation had been fixated on Trump\u2019s opponent, and whether President Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0could withstand\u00a0the defections by members of his own party after a poor showing at the CNN presidential debate in June. But by the time Trump arrived in Butler, attention was turning toward\u00a0the convention in Milwaukee. Interest was high in his imminent announcement of a running mate, and he was less than a week from accepting his party\u2019s nomination for president for the third consecutive election cycle. Trump\u2019s fans and voters in Butler \u2013 many of them donning\u00a0the familiar red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats \u2013 were looking forward to hearing from the man himself, braving the mid-July sun to wait for hours on a day with highs around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Two and a half hours before Trump took the stage, the rally attendees watched a typical rally pre-show: There was a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, and the national anthem, sung by a 16-year-old teenager. Then a raft of the former president\u2019s supporters \u2013 including two congressmen and a Senate candidate \u2013\u00a0spoke to warm up the crowd ahead of the rally headliner. \u201cHe was very upbeat and excited about the rally because it was such a great turnout,\u201d said Dave McCormick, the Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania who saw Trump\u00a0before the shooting. McCormick was whisked\u00a0into the venue through a private entrance manned by members of the Secret Service. There, someone waved a security wand around him to ensure he was not carrying a weapon. \u201cSecurity,\u201d\u00a0he said Sunday, \u201cseemed tight.\u201d Other attendees had to go through magnetometers, or walk-through metal detectors, to get into the rally. It was there that one person caught the attention of authorities: Crooks was spotted by local law enforcement, who thought he\u00a0was\u00a0acting suspiciously near the magnetometers, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to the Secret Service as well, according to the source. Indeed, a local officer\u00a0spotted Crooks before he began shooting\u00a0but could not engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told CNN. The officer was searching the area after Butler Township officers received calls about a suspicious person outside the rally perimeter, Slupe said. Officers eventually discovered Crook was on the roof, and one local officer hoisted another up to peer over the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer and pointed his gun at him, Slupe said. The officer let go to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. \u2018This is a big, big, beautiful crowd\u2019 Trump was initially scheduled to go on stage about 5 p.m.\u00a0ET, but he was running late. It wasn\u2019t until 6:02 p.m.\u00a0that Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d began blaring on the venue\u2019s speakers and the former president walked up the short staircase on the left side of the makeshift rally stage. Trump was wearing a white shirt without a tie, a dark navy suit and his signature red \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d hat. As Greenwood\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an American\u201d chorus played in the background, Trump circled the stage, clapping to the audience and pointing at various attendees seated both in front of him as well as in the grandstands behind him. Trump\u2019s supporters waved \u201cTrump 2024\u201d signs that read \u201cCrooked Joe You\u2019re Fired!\u201d on the back. At 6:05 p.m., the song finished and Trump took to the lectern at the center of the stage. \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d the attendees chanted. \u201cThis is a big crowd\u00a0\u2014 this is a big, big, beautiful crowd,\u201d Trump said at the start of his speech. As he did at every rally, Trump quickly began\u00a0by\u00a0criticizing Biden, warning about immigrants coming across US borders, and vowing to win Pennsylvania and \u201ctake back our country.\u201d He noted McCormick, the GOP Pennsylvania Senate candidate, seated in front of him. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get a good senator,\u201d Trump told the crowd, pointing to McCormick and saying he would bring him up on stage a little bit\u00a0later. Trump continued with his speech. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I go off teleprompter, do you?\u201d he asked the crowd to cheers at 6:10 p.m., exactly 60 seconds before the shots began. The former president turned his attention to a chart with border statistics displayed on a massive screen over his right shoulder offstage. \u201cTake a look at that chart,\u201d Trump said and pointed to his right \u2013 turning in the direction of the building north of him, where Crooks was preparing to take aim at the former president. Crooks had climbed onto\u00a0the flat rooftop of a light beige, single-story commercial building roughly 150 yards to the north of the rally stage. The open grass area where the rally was being held was encircled with a low chain-link fence. The building was just outside that fenced perimeter. An eyewitness described\u00a0being\u00a0on a fence line and seeing a gunman moving \u201cfrom roof to roof\u201d just before the shooting. There were several buildings in the complex. The witness, Ben Macer, told\u00a0CNN affiliate KDKA\u00a0that he went to tell an officer just moments before the shooting began. \u201cWhen I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that,\u201d Macer said. \u2018Get down, get down, get down!\u2019 At 6:11 p.m., Trump was six minutes into his speech, looking to his right and looking at the jumbotron displaying immigration statistics.\u00a0\u201cYou know that\u2019s a little bit old \u2014\u00a0that chart, that chart\u2019s a couple of months old,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cAnd if you want to really see something this sad,\u201d Trump continued, \u201ctake a look at what happened\u2026\u201d \u201cPop pop. Pop pop. Pop pop.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t finish his sentence. The sounds of several rounds of gunfire rang out across the rally site. Trump grabbed his ear and took a step backward before ducking to the ground. \u201cGet down! Get down! Get down!\u201d a male agent yelled at the former president. Five agents swarmed the stage and surrounded Trump on the floor. \u201cPop, pop, pop, pop.\u201d\u00a0 There was another round of gunshots, this time in staccato-like succession, five seconds after the first. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing, what\u2019re we doing?\u201d a female agent said, in audio that was picked up by Trump\u2019s microphone. Twelve seconds later, a third round of gunshots echoed through the show grounds. \u201cReady.\u201d \u201cMove!\u201d \u201cUp!\u201d \u201cGo, go, go.\u201d Several agents shouted short commands in succession while they remained on top of Trump. Agents in combat gear with long rifles walked onto the stage. Forty-three seconds after the first shots were fired, the agents said the shooter was down. \u201cShooter\u2019s down. Shooter\u2019s down. Are we good to move?\u201d several agents said. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d asked a female agent. \u201cWe\u2019re clear, we\u2019re clear, we\u2019re clear,\u201d agents said. \u201cLet\u2019s move, let\u2019s move,\u201d said a male agent. \u2018Wait, wait, wait\u2019 Trump was then lifted to his feet by the agents around him. \u201cLet me get my shoes on,\u201d Trump said once he was standing. \u201cHold on, your head is bloody,\u201d one of the agents told him. \u201cSir, we\u2019ve got to move to the car, sir,\u201d another agent said. \u201cLet me get my shoes,\u201d Trump said again. The agents prepared to move Trump offstage when he stopped them once more. \u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d the former president told them. Trump lifted his head above the agents surrounding him and raised his fist in the air. \u201cFight!\u201d Trump mouthed to the crowd three times, sparking loud cheers from attendees as they rose to their feet upon seeing that Trump was OK. Trump and\u00a0the\u00a0five agents surrounding him\u00a0walked in unison to the stairs at the left of the stage. Trump stopped once more to raise his fist, pumping it three times before he was carried down the stairs and into his SUV several feet away. Trump raised his fist one last time as he got into the backseat of the vehicle. \u2018It was all of a sudden just chaos\u2019 As the first gunshots echoed across the show grounds, rallygoers cried out. Members of the crowd in the bleachers behind Trump ducked, mirroring the former president, their faces a mix of confusion and fear. When one final gunshot rang out, a loud scream pierced the air. \u201cIt was all of a sudden just chaos,\u201d said McCormick, an Army combat veteran, describing the moment the Secret Service converged on the former president, shielding Trump with their own bodies. Behind him, people were gathered around \u00a0a victim, trying to administer first aid until medical assistance could make its way through the dense crowd. Adding to the chaos and confusion, a tractor parked on the other side of the stage let out a massive cloud of steam, apparently having been hit by a stray bullet. Joseph Meyn, a surgeon from nearby Grove City, was filming Trump\u2019s speech on his phone \u2014 it was his first Trump rally, he said \u2014 when he heard the gunshots and saw the former president get hit. He said that when he looked to see where the gunshots originated, he saw a man who had been shot in the head. Meyn was sure the sound was gunfire, but many other attendees thought they were hearing fireworks. \u201cHalf the crowd was in shock, and the other half thought it was some type of weird joke,\u201d Meyn said. Rico Elmore,\u00a0a former Pennsylvania legislative candidate\u00a0who had spoken at the rally earlier, vaulted over a barrier to reach a wounded attendee, he later told CNN. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired, and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d he said, visibly shaken, his own white button-down shirt by that time stained with blood. Elmore didn\u2019t know the man. \u201cJust a stranger,\u201d he said. Meyn said he \u201chelped carry the body of the man out of the stands.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey took the body to the tent behind the bleachers,\u201d he said later, while waiting to provide a witness statement to the FBI. Investigators wanted access to data on his phone, he said. One rally attendee was killed by the shots, and another two were critically injured, law enforcement\u00a0said\u00a0later that evening. The victim was identified on Sunday as Corey Comperatore. Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Comperatore was an \u201cavid supporter of the former president\u201d and was excited to be there with him in the community. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Cory loved his community. Most especially, Cory loved his family,\u201d Shapiro said. \u2018I was shot with a bullet\u2019 Trump was taken to a local hospital from the rally site, with the world watching on to learn whether he had been seriously hurt. Thirty minutes after he was shot, the Secret Service communications chief posted on X that Trump was \u201csafe,\u201d and that the incident was under investigation. Soon after, Trump\u2019s spokesman released a statement that the former president was \u201cfine\u201d and being checked out at a local medical facility. As he so often does, Trump would fill in more details about what happened through his own social media. \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social at 8:42 p.m., thanking law enforcement for their quick response and expressing condolences for the attendee\u00a0who was killed. Biden was attending church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, when the shooting occurred. After leaving church, the president was briefed on the\u00a0attack on his predecessor. Biden then made an unscheduled stop at\u00a0the local Rehoboth police department, where he denounced the \u201csick\u201d shooting and said there was \u201cno place in America for this kind of violence.\u201d \u201cI have tried to get ahold of Donald,\u201d Biden said.\u202f\u201cHe\u2019s with his doctors.\u202f\u00a0They \u2014 apparently, he\u2019s doing well.\u202fI plan on talking to him shortly, I hope, when I get back to the telephone.\u201d Biden and Trump did speak by phone later that evening.\u00a0\u202fA source briefed on the call said it was \u201cgood\u201d and\u202f\u201cshort and respectful.\u201d Before Saturday\u2019s call, the two men hadn\u2019t spoken to each other directly in years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/what-happened-trump-assassination-attempt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_biden-say-trump-shooting-bullseye", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said President Joe Biden should be \u201ccalled out\u201d for political attacks on former President Donald Trump that have contributed to what he described as a \u201cheated political environment.\u201d He urged political leaders\u00a0on both sides of the aisle\u00a0to \u201cturn the rhetoric down\u201d the morning after Trump was injured onstage in a shooting\u00a0during\u00a0a Pennsylvania campaign rally. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to turn the temperature down in this country,\u201d Johnson said on\u00a0NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cWe need leaders of all parties, on both sides, to call that out and make sure that happens so that we can go forward and maintain our free society that we all are blessed to have.\u201d He then pointed to Democratic criticism of Trump less than four months from this year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cWhen the message goes out constantly that the election of Donald Trump would be a threat to democracy and that the republic would end, I mean it heats up the environment,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said on NBC. \u201cWe cannot do that. It\u2019s simply not true. Everyone needs to turn the rhetoric down.\u201d The House speaker\u2019s comments echoed those of many other Republicans, including Trump\u2019s campaign, some of his top allies on Capitol Hill and at least one top contender for his vice presidential nomination as the party prepares to gather in Milwaukee this week for its nominating convention. One rally attendee was killed and two were critically injured, in addition to Trump, in the shooting. The FBI described the shooting as an assassination attempt and identified the gunman, who was shot and killed on the scene, as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Crooks was a registered Republican who had previously made a small contribution to a Democratic-aligned group in 2021, according to public records. So far investigators haven\u2019t found any initial signs or social media or other writings that help provide a motive, law enforcement officials say. In the moments after the failed assassination attempt at Trump\u2019s rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, Republicans \u2014 energized by a bloody Trump\u2019s defiant fist pump as Secret Service agents escorted him off stage \u2014 erupted in anger over what they described as years of Democratic persecution of Trump and his supporters. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a potential Trump vice presidential pick, said on X shortly after the shooting that Biden\u2019s rhetoric was to blame. \u201cToday is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, another potential VP pick and top Trump ally, said on X: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: This was an assassination attempt aided and abetted by the radical Left and corporate media incessantly calling Trump a threat to democracy, fascists, or worse.\u201d Trump campaign manager\u00a0Chris LaCivita\u00a0said on X that Biden, Democratic donors and leftist activists for years have made \u201cdisgusting\u201d comments targeting Trump and should be held accountable \u2014 \u201cthe best way is through the ballot box,\u201d he wrote. Johnson, LaCivita and others pointed to language Biden used in a recent private call with donors during which he urged Democrats to drop their ongoing conversations about whether the 81-year-old president should exit the race in the wake of his poor performance in his June presidential debate with Trump, and shift their focus back to defeating Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re done talking about the debate. It\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d Biden said on that call, a recording of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cPresident Biden himself said in recent days, \u2018It\u2019s time to put a bullseye on Trump.\u2019 I know he didn\u2019t mean what is being implied there, but that kind of language on either side should be called out,\u201d Johnson said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show on Sunday. \u201cWe have to make clear that this is part of our system we can have vigorous debate but it needs to end there.\u201d Some remarks from congressional Republicans were more incendiary. \u201cEvery American should be outraged at Joe Biden for inciting violence against Donald J. Trump,\u201d Texas Rep. Keith Self said on X, highlighting Biden\u2019s \u201cbullseye\u201d remark. Trump has often used violent imagery himself, including warning that the country faces a \u201cbloodbath\u201d if Biden wins in November. His supporters attacked police officers and broke doors and windows as they stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn the 2020 election results amid Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread fraud. The former president has also mocked the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was attacked by an assailant with a hammer at their San Francisco home in 2022. The former president also has often said Biden is the real threat to democracy, and claims the president would dissolve US borders. In the June debate, repeating a claim that is a staple of Trump\u2019s rallies and speeches, he said if Biden wins in November, \u201cwe probably won\u2019t have a country left anymore, that\u2019s how bad it is.\u201d Biden spoke from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Saturday evening, saying he had been \u201cthoroughly briefed\u201d on the shooting. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d Biden spoke to Trump by phone Saturday night. A source briefed on the call described it as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cshort and respectful.\u201d A senior White House official also briefed on the call similarly described it as \u201cbrief and respectful.\u201d The official said Biden repeated his assertion there was no place or tolerance for political violence and assured him he was directing agencies for a full investigation. The shooting had at least momentarily halted Democrats\u2019 political attacks on Trump, as Biden\u2019s campaign paused all television advertising and communications efforts on Saturday night. Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her trip to Florida in response to the shooting, according to a campaign official. She had originally planned on traveling to Palm Beach on Tuesday for a moderated conversation alongside Republican women to discuss Trump\u2019s stance on women\u2019s reproductive rights. The Biden campaign and Democrats across the party were scrambling Sunday to determine how to adjust their counter-messaging plans for the Republican National Convention in the wake of the assassination attempt. \u201cThe big issue is how to campaign against him or attack him,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN. \u201cCan we even do that this week?\u201d The adviser said discussions are underway to calibrate attacks and criticism aimed at Trump to focus on policy differences, rather than personal attacks. Plans that had been underway for weeks to respond to the GOP convention are being reviewed and potentially adjusted. The Biden campaign has yet to decide when to resume its advertising campaign against Trump, which was suspended Saturday night after the shooting. But that, a separate Democratic strategist said, was the easy decision. A harder question is how and when to resume, with 114 days until the election. While public calls for Biden to step aside have cooled in the aftermath of the attack, the concerns voiced directly to the president in calls on Saturday have hardly gone away. A White House official said Sunday the president would continue his outreach to lawmakers and supporters, but would turn his immediate focus to his presidential duties of directing the government\u2019s response to the first assassination attempt of a former president and presidential candidate in more than four decades. Other Democratic leaders similarly condemned the shooting. \u201cPolitical violence has no place in our country,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries similarly said in a statement that political violence is \u201cnever acceptable.\u201d GOP South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d he was supposed to play golf with Trump on Sunday and plans to see the former president later in the day. \u201cI wish I could say I was surprised, but I\u2019ve been worried about this for a very, very long time. You know, if he wins democracy is not going to end. He\u2019s not a fascist. He represents a point of view that millions share. The rhetoric is way too hot, but I was just grateful that he made it,\u201d he said. Graham praised his Democratic colleagues for their responses, saying \u201cit\u2019s good to see.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes,\u00a0Jeff Zeleny,\u00a0Hannah Rabinowitz, Evan Perez\u00a0and Danya Gainor contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/biden-say-trump-shooting-bullseye/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick Ohio Sen. JD Vance was once a fervent critic of the former president. In private messages, he wondered ahead of Trump\u2019s election whether he was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and in 2017 said the then-president\u00a0was a\u00a0\u201cmoral disaster.\u201d In public, he agreed Trump was a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d who didn\u2019t care about regular people and called him \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler,\u201d Vance wrote in a message to a friend\u00a0in 2016. \u201cHow\u2019s that for discouraging?\u201d In 2016 and 2017, Vance, then best-known for penning the best-selling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d said Trump was \u201ccultural heroin\u201d and \u201cjust another opioid\u201d\u00a0for Middle America. He told CNN ahead of the 2016 election that he was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d voting for Trump and he also contemplated voting for Hillary Clinton (he ultimately said he planned to vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin.) \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us,\u201d\u00a0he tweeted\u00a0after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape was published in 2016. Vance also\u00a0liked tweets\u00a0that said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a deleted-tweet. Trump\u2019s vice president announcement on Monday caps a dramatic reversal on Vance\u2019s part. He made his most critical remarks when he was promoting his memoir\u00a0\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0which was published in 2016. The book had catapulted him to fame as a \u201cTrump whisperer,\u201d capable of explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to the White working class. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna vote for Trump\u00a0because I think that he\u2019s projecting very complex problems onto simple villains,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper ahead of the 2016 election. But by 2020, Vance fully embraced Trump, telling podcaster Megyn Kelly after the election he voted for him. A year\u00a0later,\u00a0Vance announced he was running for Senate in Ohio and vied for Trump\u2019s endorsement, which he ultimately received. But at the beginning of that campaign, Vance was\u00a0forced to apologize\u00a0after CNN resurfaced old tweets from the 2016 campaign and early in 2017 in Trump\u2019s administration that he had deleted. \u201cI did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance told Fox News\u00a0in 2021.\u00a0 In a\u00a0statement to CNN last month, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d for changing his mind on\u00a0the former president. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Vance won his Senate race in 2022 by\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0\u2013 less than the\u00a08.1 percentage points Trump\u00a0won the state\u00a0by\u00a0in 2020. Vance\u2019s remarkable political evolution underscores the broader trend of realignment in the country and the GOP as the party becomes one of\u00a0working-class\u00a0White\u00a0voters. \u2018I\u00a0don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks\u2019 In comments promoting his book, Vance often said Trump played\u00a0to\u00a0or exploited\u00a0White\u00a0working-class\u00a0voters\u2019 fears and prejudices. \u201cAnd I cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud,\u201d\u00a0one radio host said\u00a0to Vance when promoting his book in 2016. \u201cI think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people.\u201d \u201cI do too. And it\u2019s like you, like you said, I, I agree with you on Trump because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored.\u201d In\u00a0September 2016, Vance argued Trump\u2019s immigration policies like the \u201cgreat Mexican Wall,\u201d were overly simplistic and aimed to give folks something to latch on to. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Vance also argued in 2016 that if White working-class people attended church, they would not be as attracted to Trump. \u201cI think Trump provides that sense of community that many in the White working class would have, if they actually went to church,\u201d Vance\u00a0told\u00a0New York public radio. \u201cI think if folks went to church a little bit more, they may not be as excited or as attracted to the sort of social experience that Trump provides.\u201d Vance once said racism played a role in Trump support Vance also said that racism and xenophobia played a role in Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cThere is definitely an element of Donald Trump\u2019s support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia, but a lot of these folks are just really hardworking people who are struggling in really important ways,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in a September 2016\u00a0\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d\u00a0Interview. \u201cDefinitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in an interview at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. Speaking with CNN in October 2016, Vance criticized Trump for\u00a0\u201cactively antagonizing\u201d\u00a0Black voters, claiming this tactic was a long-standing Republican strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak to issues of special concern of minority voters or Black voters, it\u2019s that he seems to like actively antagonizing a lot of the Black voters,\u201d Vance\u00a0said during a panel discussion. In a July 2016 interview with American Conservative, a right-leaning publication, he added Trump was making the problem of racial resentment \u201cworse\u201d by talking about \u201crapist immigrants and banning all Muslims\u201d as part of his message. To that end \u2013 Vance once tweeted he found Trump reprehensible. \u201cTrump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\u201d\u00a0he wrote in October 2016.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_aileen-cannon-handling-trump-classified-documents-case-mar-a-lago", "text": "After a year of court hearings examining far-fetched theories about presidential classification\u00a0power, flimsy accusations of prosecutorial misconduct and heated debates about redacting court filings, Judge Aileen Cannon ended Jack Smith\u2019s classified documents prosecution of former President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump on Monday for a more foundational \u2013 but nonetheless astonishing \u2013 reason. She said Smith was unconstitutionally appointed as special counsel and that the funding of his office also violated the law. Her dismissal of the case on that rationale is at odds with several other court rulings from judges across the country that have upheld the Justice Department\u2019s use of special counsels to spearhead politically sensitive investigations. Cannon\u2019s ruling is the climax of what was a frustrating run for the Smith team in front of the Trump-appointed trial judge in Fort Pierce, Florida. Her behavior in that case \u2013 as well as in a lawsuit brought by Trump to attack the documents investigation before he was charged \u2013\u00a0has been scrutinized by legal experts across the political spectrum. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that this is an extreme argument about the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, it\u2019s that it\u2019s one that exactly one Supreme Court justice has endorsed and lots of precedent refutes,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University of Law. However, Trump\u2019s arguments got a boost earlier this month with a concurrence from Justice Clarence Thomas, in the Supreme Court case examining what immunity the former president has in Smith\u2019s election subversion prosecution. That concurrence\u00a0was cited repeatedly in Cannon\u2019s 93-page opinion Monday. In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office, said that the Justice Department has approved plans to appeal. \u201cThe dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the Attorney General is statutorily authorized to appoint a Special Counsel,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe Justice Department has authorized the Special Counsel to appeal the court\u2019s order.\u201d Politically, the timing of Cannon\u2019s dismissal of the case could not have been better for Trump, even as her opinion did not exonerate him or weigh in on the merits of Smith\u2019s allegations against Trump. The ruling came down on the first day of the Republican National Convention, which will coronate Trump as the GOP\u2019s White House nominee, and after a failed assassination attempt on Saturday rallied the party behind him. Before Monday\u2019s ruling, it was highly unlikely Smith\u2019s case \u2014 which accused Trump of mishandling sensitive documents taken from his White House and then obstructing the investigation into them \u2014 would go to trial before the election. But the time it will take to appeal of Cannon\u2019s ruling makes that an impossibility, and her opinion is likely to encourage his attorneys to bring the same arguments in the election subversion case in Washington, DC. \u201cThe stakes are high, because the special counsel\u2019s office has been a good tool,\u201d CNN legal analyst Michael Moore said on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s now brought all that into question with this order.\u201d \u201cWe go from little courthouse down in South Florida, and now this is like shooting a missile to the courthouse in Washington, DC,\u201d added Moore, a former US attorney in the Obama administration. An unlikely Trump argument gets an assist from Clarence Thomas Just last week, Smith\u2019s office argued to Cannon in court filings that she should not factor in Thomas\u2019 writing in the Supreme Court immunity dispute when deciding whether the appointment was valid. The prosecutors noted that the appointment issue had not been presented to the justices and that no one else on the court joined Thomas in the concurrence. In the immunity case, the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority decided that Trump had some immunity in the January 6, 2021, election subversion prosecution. Trump\u2019s lawyers had not challenged the legality of Smith\u2019s appointment in that case, and only Thomas raised the issue to say that the attorney general lacked the statutory power to appoint Smith, creating a separation-of-powers problem. Thomas\u2019 criticisms of how Smith had been appointed previewed the arguments that Cannon would ultimately adopt. She concluded that his prosecution violated the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause, because Congress had not passed legislation that explicitly gave the attorney general power to outsource the investigation to an outside prosecutor. Her ruling cut against several other cases where judges rejected challenges to the appointments of other special counsels, including in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe and in special counsel David Weiss\u2019 prosecution of Hunter Biden.\u00a0In other special counsel cases, defendants have not even bothered to bring the long-shot claims. \u201cI don\u2019t think that, before Justice Thomas wrote his concurrence, this argument had a snowball\u2019s chance,\u201d said Mark Schnapp, a criminal defense attorney in South Florida who has been a close watcher of the classified document case. Cannon additionally said that how Smith\u2019s office was funded also violated the Constitution, an argument that was\u00a0not addressed by Thomas. She held detailed-oriented hearing on both claims last month. While it\u2019s not known how far along Cannon was in considering her ruling when Thomas penned his concurrence in the immunity case, outside legal experts were skeptical that Thomas\u2019 move to opine on the question \u2013 which was not teed up in the Trump January 6 case before the justices \u2013 was a coincidence. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Justice Thomas wrote his concurrence, which addressed an issue that was not before the Supreme Court, with no awareness that it would be used this way,\u201d Vladeck said. In concurrence opinion, Thomas called on lower courts to \u201canswer these essential questions\u201d about Smith\u2019s appointment before proceeding with the prosecutions against Trump, given the historical nature of the cases against the former president. All eyes on expected appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling was a shock\u00a0but fits with the\u00a0eyebrow-raising way she had presided over both the criminal case, brought in June 2023, and over a lawsuit Trump brought the year prior challenging FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago. In that lawsuit, a conservative appeals court repeatedly overturned rulings by her that blocked investigators from accessing the documents they had seized and that ordered a third party-review of the materials. In a scathing opinion, the 11th\u00a0US Circuit Court of Appeals said\u00a0she was giving Trump undue special treatment because he was a former president. While\u00a0Cannon\u00a0has attracted criticisms\u00a0before Monday with her actions in the case, she had not issued the kind of substantive ruling that would give Smith the opportunity to ask for the 11th Circuit to intervene. Many outside observers have called for her removal from the case, but higher courts\u00a0typically do not take trial judges off of proceedings\u00a0absent a clear and lengthy record of egregiously wrong rulings \u2013 and it\u2019s unclear whether Smith would make such a request based on Monday\u2019s dismissal decision alone. Yet even if it is appealed and heard on an expedited basis, the issue is all but guaranteed not to be resolved in time for the case to go to trial before the election. Trump is expected to make the prosecution go away if voters return him to the White House. \u201cThe odds are that if the Supreme Court ever considers this question, it will agree with the special counsel, and not Cannon \u2013 but that won\u2019t happen any time soon,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cLike the January 6 prosecution the future of this case now almost certainly hinges the election results this November.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/aileen-cannon-handling-trump-classified-documents-case-mar-a-lago/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

He had a gun,\u201d Mike DiFrischia said of the shooter. \u201cAnd then when he said that, I moved over a couple of feet, and I was able to get a perfect, I was able to see him perfectly,\u201d he continued. Then he began to record. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement \u2014 was trying to tell them, you know, where he was, but they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building. So it just got very hectic, very fast,\u201d DiFrischia said. Law enforcement officials asked the DiFrischias, \u201cWhere\u2019s he at?\u201d and they pointed toward the shooter\u2019s location, they told Burnett. Shortly after attempting to alert authorities to the shooter\u2019s position, Amber DiFrischia said people began to run. And then they began to hear gunshots. \u201cIt was just chaotic. It was so fast. First thing is, find coverage. And it was just the scariest thing, you know, there\u2019s not a lot of places you can hide there,\u201d she said, adding they tried \u201cto hide behind two trees just to make sure we weren\u2019t going to be, you know, hit by the bullets.\u201d Mike DiFrischia described how he watched one officer try to climb the building but not make it to the shooter\u2019s location, explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t know if the guy startled him, or what exactly happened.\u201d Though the DiFrischias could not immediately identify that officer, CNN has reported a local officer saw the gunman and was hoisted by another to get up to the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop. Trump, who says he was shot in the ear, was rushed offstage with blood on his face. As CNN has reported, widespread concerns and questions have surfaced about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president\u2019s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Sources have described the shooting as coming from the \u201cthree o\u2019clock\u201d position of Trump\u2019s\u00a0podium location,\u00a0with shots coming from his right side.\u00a0Seconds after gunfire rang out, Secret Service counter-assault snipers began shooting the suspect, who was found deceased on top of the roof. Mike DiFrischia, who said his recording also captured the gunman lifeless atop the building, recounted how he first thought the shooter was facing the crowd and had told people around him to get down. \u201cWhen I first seen him looking our way, I thought that he was actually, you know, maybe gonna start shooting this way. I did not realize he had already been shot,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_joe-biden-nbc-interview", "text": "President Joe Biden defended himself against criticisms over his rhetoric, which has been put in the spotlight in the aftermath of the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump \u2013 but said it was a mistake to say it was \u201ctime to put Trump in a bullseye.\u201d Biden made those comments during a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put Trump in the bullseye,\u201d according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign. \u201cIt was a mistake to use the word,\u201d Biden said in an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt on Monday. \u201cI meant focus on him. Focus on what he\u2019s doing. Focus on his policies, focus on the number of lies he told at the debate,\u201d he said. Biden sought to turn the conversation back to Trump\u2019s own words: \u201cI\u2019m not the guy that said, \u2018I want to be a dictator on day one.\u2019 I\u2019m not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I\u2019m not the guy who said he won\u2019t accept the outcome of this election automatically. You can\u2019t only love your country when you win. And so the focus was on what he\u2019s saying.\u201d The comments come a day after Biden used a rare Oval Office address to urge Americans to cool the political rhetoric on both sides of the aisle. \u201cThe political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It\u2019s time to cool it down. We all have a responsibility to do that,\u201d he said on Sunday night. The White House and campaign have followed suit. White House press secretary Karine\u00a0Jean-Pierre was repeatedly pressed Monday on recent comments from Biden prior to Saturday\u2019s events, including saying in Detroit Friday that Trump would be president \u201cover my dead body\u201d and that \u201canother four years of Donald Trump is deadly serious.\u201d She did not disavow the president\u2019s language. \u201cWhat I would refer you to \u2026 is the last three days and what the president has said. You heard directly from him what he\u2019s laid out, how he sees the future, how it\u2019s important to be able to speak to different agendas. It is important to speak to someone\u2019s record, someone\u2019s character. Violence has no place in America. Political violence is not OK. It is not. It is just not,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s\u00a0reelection campaign is also treading carefully around an extraordinarily delicate moment in American politics. The widely understood internal directive at the moment, as one senior adviser put it to CNN, is to be careful on all matters related to Trump \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d That has put Biden\u2019s past language under the microscope. Pressed by Holt on whether he has used inciting language, Biden suggested that it was necessary to characterize Trump as a \u201cthreat to democracy.\u201d \u201cHow do you talk about the threat to democracy \u2013 which is real \u2013 when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything \u2013 because it may incite somebody?\u201d he questioned. He again turned the focus back on Trump\u2019s own words, adding, \u201cI am not engaged in that rhetoric. Now my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric: He talks about it\u2019ll be a bloodbath if he loses, talking about how he\u2019s going to forgive all the actions, I guess suspend the sentences of all those who were arrested and sentenced to go to jail because of what happened in the Capitol. I\u2019m not out there making fun of like when remember the picture of Donald Trump when Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband was hit with a hammer going \u2013 talking \u2013 joking about it?\u201d Asked by Holt about his conversation with Trump following Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt, Biden said the call was \u201cvery cordial.\u201d \u201cI told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing,\u201d Biden said. Trump, he continued, \u201csounded good. He said he was fine. And he thanked me for calling him. I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me and his whole family was weathering this.\u201d Biden won\u2019t speculate on future of 2024 race The president declined to speculate on what the attempt on Trump\u2019s life means for the trajectory of the 2024 campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Biden said. But he suggested he was focused on Trump\u2019s health and the safety of all candidates, including Sen. JD Vance, who Trump announced as his running mate Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve thought less about the trajectory of the case than two things: One, what his health is, that he\u2019s secure, number one. And number two, what happens from here on in terms of the kind of coverage that the president and vice president and former president and new vice president get,\u201d the president said. He went on to lament high tensions and heated political rhetoric, pointing to inflammatory signage he\u2019s seen on the road as \u201ca very different thing than saying I really disagree with Trump, the way he takes care of taxes.\u201d Biden said he wasn\u2019t surprised that Vance was Trump\u2019s choice as running mate. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual. He\u2019s going to surround himself with people who agree completely with him,\u201d Biden said in the interview. He also nodded toward some of Vance\u2019s pointed criticisms about Trump before he ran for Senate: \u201cEven though, if you go back and listen to some of the things JD Vance said about Trump,\u201d Biden said, laughing as he trailed off.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_local-officer-tried-stop-gunman-trump", "text": "A local police officer saw the gunman on the rooftop during former President Donald Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania rally on Saturday but was unable to engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Sunday. Slupe said that Butler Township officers received calls about a suspicious person outside the perimeter of the rally and went looking to find that person. The initial calls did not indicate the suspicious person had a gun, he said. During the search for the suspicious person, officers with township police discovered that the gunman was on the roof, and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his own life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop. Trump, who says he was shot in the ear, was rushed offstage with blood on his face. When asked if the overall security lapse that led to a gunman having a direct line of sight to Trump was a failure, Slupe said it \u201cobviously\u201d was. \u201cThis is being investigated and obviously at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to learn something from it,\u201d Slupe said. He went on to say the agencies were not made aware of intel or red flags ahead of the rally in Butler, which the Trump campaign announced on July 3. About a week before the rally, Slupe said there was a big meeting at which the US Secret Service, state police, township police, bomb squads and other law enforcement entities discussed roles and responsibilities. \u201cEveryone who had a potential role was in that meeting,\u201d Slupe told CNN. There were other meetings for security preparations, but this was the only one Slupe was aware of involving all law enforcement entities. Slupe, who was positioned inside the perimeter near the firing line during the rally, said he didn\u2019t think there was actual gunfire when he first heard the popping noises. He described turning around to see where the noise was coming from and seeing that a rally attendee had been shot. Had he known there were any threats of a gunman, Slupe said, he would have done \u201ceverything to stop him (Trump) from coming out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/local-officer-tried-stop-gunman-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters", "text": "Which one of these candidates is facing calls from members of their own party to step aside in the presidential race: \u25ba Is it the recently convicted felon, also indicted for election interference and mishandling classified documents, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation as well as lying about his net worth to get loans tied to his massive real estate portfolio? \u25ba Or is it the incumbent president with a recent record of accomplishment in a bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a dubiously named piece of legislation that nonetheless addressed many of his party\u2019s priorities, like climate change? Both men are well into retirement age. Both ramble through answers to questions when they bother to take them. Both mix up names. Neither took part in debates during a primary season in which they racked up wins. And yet one of the men, former President Donald Trump, 78, has been able to remake the Republican Party around his own divisive persona. The other, President Joe Biden, 81, has now spent weeks defiantly defending his fitness for the job, slowly emerging from a protective bubble at the White House after a disastrous debate and spotty subsequent interviews. The next week will offer a fresh look at what must feel like a cruel dichotomy to Biden supporters. The GOP is now built around Trump When the Republican National Convention gets underway Monday, it will show off a speaking schedule full of far right personalities and an official party platform rewritten and simplified around Trump\u2019s priorities. Trump, between now and then, will pick a vice president from a short list of people who have previously criticized him but are now all in. In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination with insults about the size of Trump\u2019s hands, calling him a con man and arguing he couldn\u2019t be trusted with nuclear codes. Now Rubio is a Trump convert. So is Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who went from never-Trumper to true believer. Some Democrats are moving in an opposite direction. Longtime supporters now want Biden out of the race for fear he can\u2019t beat Trump, which\u00a0is\u00a0the one and only goal of Democrats afraid of his return to the White House. In any event, Rubio and Vance, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who are also reportedly on Trump\u2019s vice presidential short list, should be wary. His previous vice president, Mike Pence, is among the many people who served in Trump\u2019s first White House who have not endorsed Trump\u2019s latest election bid after an angry mob, inspired by Trump, stormed the Capitol with chants of \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Republicans had the opportunity to go a different direction. A CNN poll released back in February, before Trump had sealed the Republican presidential nomination, suggested his top Republican rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would fare much better in a head-to-head contest with Biden. Republican primary voters doubled down, decisively, on Trump. One of Haley\u2019s major policy proposals was a test for for older candidates like Biden and Trump, a prescient idea since Biden is now facing calls that he take a cognitive test and Trump has bragged that he could easily pass one. Still trying to convince fellow Democrats While Trump eyes a convention to celebrate his dominance next week, Biden is fighting back the argument that Democratic convention delegates should pick a younger successor next month. The latest in a series of public tests of Biden\u2019s abilities will be another interview with a network news anchor, NBC this time, broadcast in prime time on Monday. It\u2019s late in the election cycle for Democrats to be having this conversation, since the primary season has ended, their convention takes place next month and Trump is currently thought to have an advantage in key states heading into the November election. There are some indications Biden is regaining some support among key Democrats. While over a dozen lawmakers have called on him to drop out, with the number continuing to rise Friday, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime ally, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that the conversation about Biden\u2019s fitness needs to end before it hurts the party. \u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 with Biden,\u201d Clyburn said. If Biden dropped out, Clyburn said he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Progressives lawmakers, people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent \u2013 not Biden\u2019s natural allies on the policy front \u2013 are also standing up for Biden, arguing the party should rally around him and mobilize for November. Biden, meanwhile, despite the majority of polling that suggests he trails Trump in key states likely to decide the election, said at a rare news conference Thursday that he hasn\u2019t been shown polling data that suggests he would lose in November. The fact that he said polling data could theoretically convince him to leave the race is an adjustment from last week, when he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d could sway him. A bridge no more Biden also said at the news conference that he had changed his mind about a 2020 pledge to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between his older generation of lawmakers and and a new generation of leaders. \u201cWhat I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom and know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\u201d he said. Convinced he can beat Trump Biden also clearly believes that he is still the best person to beat Trump \u2013 the motivating principle for any Democrat these days \u2013 and Biden has been shocked during his presidency at the staying power of Trump and the MAGA turn of the GOP. \u201cHe thought it would be in the rearview mirror by now,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a recent book about Biden\u2019s presidency, \u201cThe Fight of His Life,\u201d speaking to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was necessarily planning to be a two-term president, but now that Trump is the alternative, Joe Biden really believes in his bones that he\u2019s the guy to beat him,\u201d Whipple said. In an odd twist, then, the thing keeping Biden in the race may be the very thing that has caused other Democrats to call for him to drop out.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_classified-documents-case-trump-dismissed-aileen-cannon", "text": "A federal judge on Monday dismissed the classified documents case against Donald Trump, a shock ruling that clears away one of the major legal challenges facing the former president. In a 93-page ruling, District Judge Aileen Cannon said the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution. She did not rule on whether Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper or not. \u201cIn the end, it seems the Executive\u2019s growing comfort in appointing \u2018regulatory\u2019 special counsels in the more recent era has followed an ad hoc pattern with little judicial scrutiny,\u201d Cannon wrote. The ruling by Cannon, a judge Trump appointed in 2020, comes on the first day of the Republican National Convention and as the nation reels from the failed attempt on Trump\u2019s life over the weekend. Even though a trial before the presidential election was considered highly unlikely, many legal experts had viewed the classified documents case as the strongest one of the four cases that were pending against the former president. Trump on Truth Social said the dismissal \u201cshould be just the first step\u201d as he called for the other cases facing him also to be dismissed, claiming that the charges were \u201cpolitical attacks.\u201d In a statement Monday evening, Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office, said that the Justice Department has approved plans to appeal. \u201cThe dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the Attorney General is statutorily authorized to appoint a Special Counsel,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe Justice Department has authorized the Special Counsel to appeal the court\u2019s order.\u201d The White House referred requests for comment to the Justice Department. Smith had charged Trump last year with taking classified documents from the White House and resisting the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. He pleaded not guilty. In a separate criminal case brought by Smith against Trump in Washington, DC, the special counsel was pursuing federal charges stemming from Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump also faces a state-level election subversion case in Georgia and he was convicted of state crimes in New York earlier this year for his role in a hush money payment scheme before the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s efforts to dismiss the case under the appointments clause was seen as a long shot, as several special counsels \u2013 even during his own presidential administration \u2013 were run the same way. But the fringe argument gained steam when Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas threw his support behind the theory, writing in a footnote in the high court\u2019s presidential immunity decision that there are \u201cserious questions whether the Attorney General has violated that structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law. Those questions must be answered before this prosecution can proceed.\u201d Still, Cannon held a hearing on the issue several weeks ago, pushing attorneys to explain exactly how Smith\u2019s investigation into Trump was being funded. The judge\u2019s questions were so pointed that special counsel attorney James Pearce argued that, even if Cannon were to throw out the case due to an appointments clause issue, the Justice Department was \u201cprepared\u201d to fund Smith\u2019s cases through trial if necessary. Cannon said in her order that the special counsel\u2019s position \u201ceffectively usurps\u201d Congress\u2019 \u201cimportant legislative authority\u201d by giving it to the head of a department \u2013 DOJ, in this case \u2013 to appoint such an official. \u201cIf the political branches wish to grant the Attorney General power to appoint Special Counsel Smith to investigate and prosecute this action with the full powers of a United States Attorney, there is a valid means by which to do so,\u201d she wrote. Could case be revived? Cannon said in her ruling Monday that the Justice Department \u201ccould reallocate funds to finance the continued operation of Special Counsel Smith\u2019s office,\u201d but said it\u2019s not yet clear whether a newly-brought case would pass legal muster. \u201cFor more than 18 months, Special Counsel Smith\u2019s investigation and prosecution has been financed by substantial funds drawn from the Treasury without statutory authorization, and to try to rewrite history at this point seems near impossible,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cThe Court has difficulty seeing how a remedy short of dismissal would cure this substantial separation-of-powers violation, but the answers are not entirely self-evident, and the caselaw is not well developed.\u201d She noted in her ruling that Smith\u2019s team \u201csuggested\u201d at a court hearing on the matter that they could restructure the office\u2019s funding to satisfy her concerns. This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/classified-documents-case-trump-dismissed-aileen-cannon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_bash-americas-deadliest-election-louisiana", "text": "On May 7, 1873, Louisiana Gov. William Pitt Kellogg made his way to his carriage following a meeting in New Orleans, when a man named Charles R. Railey confronted him. \u201cI wanted to tell you that you were a cowardly and usurping scoundrel and that if you have any courage you will stand like a man and I will treat you as the scoundrel you have shown yourself to be,\u201d Railey told Kellogg, who replied somewhat huffily, \u201cI am not acquainted with you, and I don\u2019t know that I have done anything to offend you, sir.\u201d As Kellogg\u2019s carriage rounded the corner one shot rang out.\u00a0He raised his hand to his neck as his driver raced them away, and though early reports said Kellogg had been shot in his neck and gravely wounded, it turned out that the bullet had just missed him. He later explained, \u201cI heard a shot and simultaneously felt the passage of a shot by my neck.\u201d It\u2019s one of the many often forgotten events in US history that I learned about while working on an upcoming book \u201cAmerica\u2019s Deadliest Election, A Cautionary Tale of the Most Violent Election in American History,\u201d with my coauthor David Fisher. Since the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, many have rightly pointed to the sad, bloody history of violence against American political leaders \u2013 the murders of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy, and the attempted assassinations of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. But what happened in Louisiana between 1872 and 1877 should stand as a warning about the way that violence can disrupt the American electoral process. By 1873, Kellogg was embroiled in an unprecedented standoff because of a bitterly contested election. He was a Republican who backed Reconstructionist policies to help integrate newly freed Black Americans. He claimed that he had won the 1872 gubernatorial contest. But Democrat John D. McEnery, whose campaign was rooted in White nationalism, also claimed to have won. For months following, Kellogg and McEnery each claimed to be Louisiana governor, having both been sworn in, and dueling legislatures worked simultaneously, each claiming it was duly elected and therefore in charge of passing laws and going about the state\u2019s business. McEnery\u2019s supporters took to the streets and after raucous chants of \u201cHang him! Hang him!\u201d they tried to overthrow the legally recognized legislature. What prompted this bedlam was election results that were impossible to properly count.\u00a0The reason? The Civil War was over, and Black men were legally allowed to vote and helped Republicans win in 1870. Two years later, Louisiana Democrats were determined to take back the state by preventing Black men from voting through intimidation and voter suppression.\u00a0Republicans provided affidavits from Blacks who were not able to vote. What ensued wasn\u2019t just political strife, but deadly violence.\u00a0Less than a month before the assassination attempt on Kellogg was the infamous Colfax massacre, where\u00a0Black men in favor of the Reconstruction policies giving them new rights occupied the Colfax courthouse in Grant Parish, Louisiana. On Easter Sunday morning, White supremacists stormed the building and went on a killing spree, brutally murdering some 150 Black men. Another disputed election, more political violence As for the gubernatorial election dispute in 1872, it happened again in 1876.\u00a0As did another assassination attempt. Republicans claimed that their candidate, Stephen Packard, won. Democrats said Francis T. Nicholls was victorious. In January, two months after the election, once again both men were sworn into the role.\u00a0Nicholls had the backing of The White League, which formed a militia to take control of the state government. They almost succeeded until Packard secured federal assistance from President Ulysses S. Grant. It was against that tense, violent backdrop that a neatly dressed, handsome young man later identified as William Weldon went to Packard\u2019s office and presented a card identifying himself as Frank Hudson, correspondent for the Philadelphia Press, and was admitted. Weldon took a seat several feet behind the governor. After patiently waiting a few minutes, he pulled a revolver and said loudly, \u201cGovernor, how long do I have to wait to see you?\u201d Packard turned and saw the muzzle pointed directly at his head. He responded instantly. In one swift movement he pushed the gun away with his left hand and slugged the would-be assassin with his right. In the melee several men drew their pistols. Police Superintendent W. F. Loan fired one shot at the assailant, and Packard reportedly stepped in front of Weldon, saving his life. Then the governor was hustled out of the room to a safer, upper floor. Packard was fortunate: Weldon\u2019s bullet had barely grazed his right leg. Weldon, equally lucky, survived Loan\u2019s shot to his left arm without serious damage. Packard survived but ultimately, his time as governor did not. America\u2019s story is complicated, especially when it comes to passions about our leaders and what and whom they represent.\u00a0And while violence should never be the answer, it has occurred more than any of us would want to admit. Back then, violence and political strife were so intertwined and lasted so long that leaders in Washington finally agreed to a compromise that allowed for racist Jim Crow laws to take over in the South. That lasted for nearly a century. In 2024, we like to hope we are a more evolved society. Perhaps by remembering history, we can ensure a better future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/bash-americas-deadliest-election-louisiana/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event", "text": "In the wake of the\u00a0attempted assassination of\u00a0Donald Trump, there are widespread concerns and questions about how a sniper was able to obtain rooftop access roughly 150 meters from the former president\u2019s position at the podium at an outdoor rally. Sources have described the shooting as coming from the \u201cthree o\u2019clock\u201d position of Trump\u2019s\u00a0podium location,\u00a0with shots coming from his right side.\u00a0Seconds after gunfire rang out, Secret Service counter-assault snipers began shooting the suspect who was found on top of a roof. Notably, the shooter\u2019s location was outside the security perimeter, raising questions about both the size of the perimeter and efforts to sweep and secure the American Glass Research building, and how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access. President Joe Biden said Sunday he has directed US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle \u201cto review all security measures \u2013 all security measures \u2013 for the Republican National Convention.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday\u2019s rally to assess exactly what happened. And I\u2019ll share the results of that independent review with the American people,\u201d Biden said. Law enforcement sources\u00a0say that part of the aftermath will include a review of\u00a0whether the Secret Service had enough assets to protect Trump days ahead of officially becoming the Republican presidential nominee and whether procedures were followed to conduct security sweeps of the building that offered a vantage point for the alleged shooter. \u201cFoundationally, one of the most basic elements of site security, especially a site that\u2019s outside and largely uncontrolled, is (to) eliminate sight lines to this space where the protectee will be either speaking or just occupying,\u201d former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday morning. \u201cWhen you look at that map, it so clearly points to those buildings that are within it, clearly within shooting range.\u201d FBI now leading the investigation into attempted assassination It is not yet clear how the shooter was able to obtain rooftop access in relatively close proximity, or why that building was left outside the \u201chard\u201d security perimeter. The FBI is now the lead agency investigating the attempted assassination. But the security lapse issue will be for the Department of Homeland Security and USSS, as well as Congress, to look into. According to CNN affiliate KDKA, a witness says he told officers that he saw a gunman moving \u201cfrom roof to roof,\u201d moments before the assassination attempt. Ben Macer was along a fence line when he saw \u201cthe guy move from roof to roof. (I) told an officer (the alleged shooter) was on the roof,\u201d KDKA reported. \u201cWhen I turned around to go back to where I was, it was when the gunshots started, and then it was just chaos, and we all came running away, and that was that.\u201d Witnesses have also told reporters that they saw a person fitting the description of the alleged\u00a0shooter carrying a rifle outside the security cordon of the rally before the shooting. The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might\u2019ve been acting suspiciously near the event magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. Multiple law enforcement sources told CNN that the shooter had explosive material in his car and residence. The Secret Service does not allow any weapons inside the cordoned off areas of any event. AGR has not responded to questions from CNN about the incident or security. Authorities have\u00a0identified the gunman involved\u00a0in the\u00a0attack\u00a0as 20-year-old\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. Multiple law enforcement sources with in-depth knowledge of Secret Service operations have told CNN counter-sniper teams have wide discretion when shooting down a threat. The Secret Service says there were four counter-sniper teams \u2013 two from USSS and two from local law enforcement. The agency says that, at the time of the shooting, Cheatle was in Milwaukee, where this week\u2019s Republican National Convention is being held. Cheatle, according to The New York Times, sent a memo on Sunday, praising the agents who were with Trump at the rally Saturday for moving quickly and neutralizing the threat. \u201cThe attempted assassination of former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, is a moment that forever will be remembered in history,\u201d she wrote in the memo, which was reviewed by the Times. CNN has reached out to the Secret Service about the reported memo. Calls from Congress for probes into security \u2018failure\u2019 Republican and Democratic lawmakers are already demanding answers from the agency on the security posture and hearings on the incident. House Speaker Mike\u00a0Johnson\u00a0vowed a \u201cfull investigation\u201d of the shooting, featuring testimony from USSS, DHS and the FBI, and two Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee have also called for an investigation. House Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d likewise said that Congress had \u201coversight scrutiny and responsibility,\u201d and said there was a \u201cfailure of the overall broader net.\u201d House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green held a call with Cheatle Sunday afternoon, pressing her on what led to Saturday\u2019s security failures,\u00a0a committee source familiar with the call told CNN. Cheatle committed to providing requested documents to the committee promptly, as able, per the source. Green also detailed the information requests he has with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, which include USSS communications and documents surrounding the rally, the source added. The Tennessee Republican sent a letter to Mayorkas earlier Sunday requesting documents about Secret Service security plans and its communications by July 19 and a briefing by\u00a0July 22. House Oversight Chairman James Comer contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and is calling on Cheatle to appear for a hearing\u00a0on July 22. New York Reps. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat, and Mike Lawler, a Republican, are also working to introduce a bill they say would give enhanced USSS protection to Trump, Biden and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u201cAs reports continue to emerge, it\u2019s clear that more protection is needed for all major candidates for president,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement provided to CNN. In a separate scathing letter to the Secret Service director on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said that there was a \u201csecurity failure at the highest level, not seen since the attempted assassination of President Reagan.\u201d \u201cThis cannot happen, and I demand accountability,\u201d Gallego, who is running for an Arizona Senate seat, said. Secret Service denies claims that it rejected requests for more security for Trump The Secret Service \u2013 along with local law enforcement in Pennsylvania who assisted in securing the rally venue, as well as sources close to Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 is denying rumors circulating on social media, including by a Republican member of Congress, that the agency had denied requests from Trump\u2019s team for more security. In a statement, the Secret Service said the detail had been increased recently. \u201cThere\u2019s an untrue assertion that a member of the former President\u2019s team requested additional security resources and that those were rebuffed,\u201d said Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.\u00a0\u201cThis is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.\u201d The FBI also pushed back on the implication on Saturday night. \u201cThere was no additional request for security that was ever denied by the FBI,\u201d Kevin Rojek, the FBI special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh office said during a news conference. The incident also raises questions about security at the upcoming Republican convention. Recently, the questions over how the Secret Service and law enforcement would treat those carrying firearms was raised at a press conference explaining the RNC security plan. A local official, Nick DeSiato, made clear due to Wisconsin law,\u00a0firearms would be allowed in the \u201csoft\u201d perimeter \u2013 an area outside the magnetometers that is limited to foot traffic. Shooting comes after other lapses in protection for high-profile officials The scrutiny comes as the Secret Service has dealt with security lapses in recent months and years. In May 2023, an intruder gained access to the home of Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, despite his round-the-clock Secret Service protection. Sullivan encountered the intruder in his home and alerted his security detail. Sullivan was unharmed. On January 6, 2021, then-incoming Vice President Kamala Harris was driven by her security detail yards away from a pipe bomb outside the Democratic National Headquarters. She was evacuated after law enforcement discovered the pipe bomb which was more than 90 minutes after her arrival. The Secret Service uses intelligence and strategic information to determine security posture. The agency is\u00a0not formally\u00a0part of the intelligence community, and is considered a \u201cconsumer\u201d of intelligence, relying heavily on relationships with agencies such as the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis. CORRECTION: This story has been updated with additional details and to correct the distance between the gunman and Donald Trump. It was 150 meters.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_biden-replacement-process-dnc", "text": "President Joe Biden said something interesting at his rare news conference Thursday when he was asked if delegates pledged to support him at the Democratic National Convention have his blessing to support another candidate. \u201cThey\u2019re free to do whatever they want,\u201d Biden said. The president noted he overwhelmingly won Democratic primaries, which is why nearly all of the convention delegates are currently considered to be pledged to him. But then he added this: \u201cTomorrow, if all of a sudden I show up at the convention and everyone says we want someone else, that\u2019s the democratic process. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he added confidently. Biden is correct that the Democrats\u2019 rules allow delegates to vote for the candidate of their choice. But it\u2019s a little more complicated than he let on. During the roll call vote that officially selects the nominee, for instance, delegates who don\u2019t vote for an acknowledged candidate would have their vote registered as \u201cpresent.\u201d Biden, at the moment, will probably be the only acknowledged candidate and in all likelihood will remain the nominee unless he steps aside. Before Biden\u2019s news conference I talked to Elaine Kamarck about how Democrats pick nominees. Kamarck knows more than most. She is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively as an academic about the primary process and is also deeply involved with the Democratic Party, where she serves on the Rules and Bylaws Committee. She told me how the process of replacing Biden would work considering nearly all of the 3,949 pledged convention delegates are currently pledged to support him. What\u2019s below are excerpts of a longer conversation conducted by phone. Is it unprecedented for a president to face this kind of challenge? KAMARCK: No, it\u2019s not unprecedented. You had it with (Jimmy) Carter. An incumbent president who everybody thought was going to lose, and so there was a check to him (by Sen. Edward Kennedy at the Democratic National Convention in 1980). Certainly LBJ (in 1968) was forced to step down, or he thought he was forced to step down, by a bad showing in the New Hampshire primary and his inability to win over the trust of the anti-war movement. So, yes, presidents have been in trouble before. They\u2019ve never been in trouble for this reason, and never so late in the process. Is it too late to replace Biden? KAMARCK: No, it is not too late to replace him. Sort of legally, according to party rules, he could be replaced anytime up to the roll call at the convention. Politically, it\u2019s very hard to replace him, because with the exception of his vice president, none of the people mentioned have risen to national stature. And their ability to talk to the Alabama delegates, as well as the Maine delegates as well as the Utah delegates is very truncated. And they don\u2019t have time to develop it. We\u2019re just running out of time. (NOTE: Governors like Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, Maryland\u2019s Wes Moore and California\u2019s Gavin Newsom are popular in their states and seen as potential future presidential candidates.) So you think the only viable replacement is Vice President Kamala Harris? KAMARCK: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s not according to the rules or anything, but realistically\u2026 think about who these 4,000 people are. First of all, they\u2019re all very loyal Biden people. So this would require Biden dropping out. Secondly, because she\u2019s been a vice president, she knows them, right? My guess is, of those 4,000 people, she\u2019s actually met a lot of them. That\u2019s not the case for anybody else who\u2019s been mentioned. The 2028 bench is a very strong bench, which is good for the party, but none of them have gotten out of their states yet. Who are the delegates to the DNC who select the party\u2019s nominee? KAMARCK: In most states, they\u2019re elected in congressional district conventions, which follow the primary. (They) file to run as delegates, and then they show up at a certain high school or someplace in their district, bringing as many of their friends and colleagues and supporters as they can. They\u2019re nominated, and they run for the delegate slots. Everybody is elected. And this is very important, because there\u2019s a lot of bullsh** running around about this being a group of elites. These people are the social studies teacher who\u2019s an active union member. These people are a leader in the pro-choice movement, or they\u2019re a county commissioner or a state delegate or something like that. These people tend to be local notables, and they tend to be very politically astute and politically active, because they\u2019ve got to run and get elected. (NOTE: There is also a much smaller group of superdelegates, or \u201cautomatic delegates,\u201d who get delegate status due to their position in the party, but who do not vote for the presidential nominee on the first ballot at the convention unless there is a consensus nominee.) How strong is the 3,949 delegates\u2019 pledge or commitment to Joe Biden? KAMARCK: The rule says \u2013 and the rule has been in effect since the 1984 convention, so it\u2019s long-standing \u2013 that delegates shall, and the operative words are, \u201cin all good conscience vote for the person they were selected to represent.\u201d It\u2019s never been tested. There\u2019s no legal history on what \u2018in all good conscience\u2019 means. Does it mean you just suddenly don\u2019t like the guy? I think probably not. Does it mean you think he\u2019s going to lose and the party will lose? We don\u2019t really know what it means because, since it was put in the rules and the \u2018robot rule\u2019 died, this has never happened. We\u2019ve never had a convention where a lot of people voted against the person that they got elected with. (NOTE: Kamarck writes more for Brookings Thursday about the \u2018in good conscience clause\u2019 and what preceded it, the so-called \u2018robot rule,\u2019 by which delegates were expected to act, essentially, like robots for the candidate who won their state\u2019s primary.) When were the most recent convention fights? KAMARCK: You can go to 1980. The Carter-Kennedy fight was a big fight. It was a real fight on the convention floor. It was bitter. It was angry. Kennedy brought a lot of stuff to the table. In the end, Carter prevailed, but he fought it out. In 1976 with the Republicans, Reagan challenged President Ford. That was a great, big fight. They were very close in delegates, and Reagan lost narrowly and then conceded. Those are the two big ones. You don\u2019t have to go way back in history to see conventions where there was a fight for the nomination. Should Democrats be talking about all of this right now? KAMARCK: I think we have to be talking about this. And I think we have to be looking at him carefully. \u2026 None of us get to see the president every single day, so it\u2019s very, very hard, and that\u2019s why I think Democrats are taking their time to think about this. I went to the Democratic congressional retreat in February, sat 20 feet away from the president and watched him answer questions from Democratic members of the House. He was fantastic. I didn\u2019t see any signs of mental fatigue or fogginess or anything like that. I thought he was fantastic. That very day that I was there, the Hur report came out. It was a very surreal experience to see this report come across the wires on my phone, and to be watching the man who was quite in command of everything. I think there\u2019s a human element to this that everybody\u2019s missing, which is that these things can develop quickly. It\u2019s really hard to tell how serious it is when you\u2019re not with him every day. And so people are being cautious. What would the roll call look like? It\u2019s not clear what Democrats\u2019 roll call will look like at the moment. The Democratic Party is considering a proposal to do a virtual roll call vote weeks before the Chicago convention is set to begin. That plan was originally hatched as a way to\u00a0comply with an early ballot access deadline in\u00a0Ohio. In the meantime,\u00a0Ohio passed a law loosening that deadline. Party leaders may yet carry on with the plan as a way to squash questions about Biden. Read more about that from\u00a0CNN\u2019s Arit John and Ethan Cohen. Democrats who sit on various committees will make those decisions at meetings in the coming weeks. The process for roll call votes is spelled out in a document, the Call for Convention, which spells out the technical rules that do not begin to seem important unless Biden drops out and the nomination is contested. Candidates for president must be nominated, for instance, by between 300-600 delegates, although not more than 50 per state. Superdelegates are restricted from voting in the first round of voting, but only if there is not a consensus nominee. A simple majority of delegates can select a nominee. Et cetera. It should be noted, though, that any of these rules can be changed by a majority of the convention. KAMARCK: The fact of the matter is that these people will descend on Chicago around August 19 and the convention will begin. And everything that goes on between now and then is just straight old politics.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_cnn-reporter-witness-trump-attack", "text": "CNN reporter Alayna Treene covers Donald Trump and was at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when shots rang out on Saturday. She spoke with CNN\u2019s Zachary Wolf about what she saw. What was supposed to be happening at this event? TREENE: It was honestly going to be a typical rally, like any other. I have now been to \u2013 I can\u2019t even count, upwards of 20 \u2013 the majority of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies since he launched his third bid, and it was a scene like any other. There\u2019s so much security presence. People often remark, \u2018Oh, you have to be safe, be careful.\u2019 And I often feel like being in a rally is one of the safest places, because there\u2019s always so much Secret Service. There\u2019s local law enforcement on the ground. You have to go through several mags (magnetometers). They have very limited options of what you can bring in. With CNN, we get security for ourselves as well, just given the divisive nature of the politics right now. So it was remarkable to me to see what had happened. Where were you situated when the shots rang out? When the shots went off, we were on the riser. We\u2019re in the middle of the crowd. There\u2019s normally a large crowd, and then we\u2019re above them. The risers are elevated. We\u2019re over the crowd so we can see. We\u2019re in line with the stage, and maybe 100 yards from the stage. We had just gone live right at the top of 6 p.m. and had begun listening to Donald Trump. Then, a couple minutes into his speech is when we had heard the pop, pop, pop. From my vantage point, it was to the left side of the stage. It was off of Donald Trump\u2019s right shoulder. At first I thought it was fireworks. I had no idea what it was. Everyone was looking, at least from where I was standing, like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 And you could see Donald Trump. He was referencing a graphic showing some border numbers during his administration. And you could see him, his face looking in that direction as well, like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 before he touched his ear and dropped to the ground. From one direction of the stage, off to his right, was where we could hear the gunshots. But then, on the left side of the stage, there was a green tractor, and after the first round of the gunshots, of the bangs that we had heard, I believe that it had hit the tractor or something on the tractor, because immediately there was this cloud. All the steam came out from the other side, the opposite side of the stage. When I talked to people on the ground, they had said that they believed that the bullets had hit something in the truck that made the steam go off. At first I remember being like, \u2018Is this part of the program? What\u2019s happening?\u2019 And then, of course, we heard everyone screaming. Immediately, it went into absolute chaos. Secret Service telling us to get down on the ground. My security guard came up onto the riser and grabbed me. He said we need to get under the risers and pulled me under there, and essentially threw me on the ground and then put his body on top of mine. And I remember, I was like, I need to get up and see what\u2019s happening. But he was holding me and other people around me down, just saying, we can\u2019t move. Stay down. Stay down. And then we could see people started cheering, and I peeked out from under the risers. And that\u2019s when Donald Trump had been starting to stand up with Secret Service around him and putting his fist in the air and being escorted off the stage. And that\u2019s when we crawled back out, and I went back on the risers to figure out what was happening and what to do next. In the video, people can be seen standing behind Trump. Did they immediately know it was gunshots? When interviewing several of the attendees, many of whom were on the bleachers behind him, some who were in one of the very front rows, they had no idea what was going on. Everyone was stunned, including myself. I don\u2019t think anyone had ever expected something like that to happen. I was talking with my producer earlier today. Sometimes you go to these rallies, you go to so many, it\u2019s the same thing. You\u2019re just waiting to hear what Donald Trump has to say. But never in a million years would we have expected an assassination attempt like that. It\u2019s just something that I don\u2019t think would ever cross our minds, because you always feel so protected with the amount of law enforcement and Secret Service on the ground. Everyone I spoke with who was there, including the people on the bleachers behind them, they had no idea. The venue was inside these fairgrounds, all grass. You had the large crowd, the press pen with the risers was in the middle of the crowd, and then you had the stage in front of us. But there was a fence, a chain link fence, surrounding all of it, keeping the rally inside. And the people next to the fence, closest to the building where the shooter was, some people over there had noticed and seen that there was a shooter, and they were screaming. And then, you know, shots broke out shortly after that. But the people I talked to who were behind him, they had a similar reaction to me, which was, \u2018Could it have been fireworks?\u2019 I interviewed one man, Joseph Meyn, he said the same thing. At first he thought it could be fireworks. \u2018Could this be part of the program?\u2019 One woman I spoke with today \u2014 her name was Renee \u2014 she was saying she was directly behind Donald Trump, on the stands behind him, and she had said she didn\u2019t really understand what was happening until she saw Donald Trump go down. And that\u2019s when she thought, \u2018Oh, wow, you have to get down. Something really bad is happening.\u2019 What happened next? How did you connect with Meyn? Immediately after, I went back onto the risers. Everyone\u2019s disoriented. People are screaming in the crowd. We went live, basically immediately. I started talking to Wolf Blitzer. A couple of minutes later, Secret Service just started pushing everybody out, unplugging our equipment and screaming at everyone, \u2018You\u2019ve got to get out of here. You got to exit the venue. This is an active crime scene.\u2019 They came up to the press, started to tell us we needed to go. Started to pull some of us away and pull us down. (Phone) service also got jammed completely. So at one point we were told that they started to jam all of the towers for all the service. So we couldn\u2019t call anybody. We weren\u2019t sure how to get in contact with DC. Obviously, that was my first goal, when I was just thinking about what to do. But eventually we just started walking out. A lot of the rally attendees were very angry with the press. When I was still on stage, people were screaming at us, saying, \u2018This is your fault.\u2019 I think that they were really seeking an outlet for their anger, and at a Trump rally, Donald Trump often talks about \u201cfake news.\u201d A lot of people yell at us all the time. That\u2019s why we normally bring security. So it was a heightened version of that. We went outside the way that we had come in, and they closed down the parking lot as well. So everyone was trying to get into their cars and leave the site, but they couldn\u2019t. People were stuck in their cars for over an hour, maybe two or three hours, and we did some live shots, but then also we realized people aren\u2019t moving, they\u2019re here. So we just started walking around and saying, \u2018Hi, would you mind doing an interview with us? We\u2019d love to talk about your experience and everyone in those moments.\u2019 Most people felt that they wanted to share what they had seen and what they had felt. And so that\u2019s how those came about. Later Saturday evening, we had seen videos circulating on social media of where the suspected shooter was located and ultimately killed by counter snipers. Given we could not exit the rally area by vehicle, we ran over on foot with our equipment. We were the only camera crew that I saw, at least at that time, who had set up in front of the building. I spotted at least a dozen police cars, some from the sheriff\u2019s department, others state troopers, cordoning off the building. One officer later that evening had confirmed it was where the shooter had fired a series of bullets toward Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/cnn-reporter-witness-trump-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Read the full text of the letter below: Melania TrumpJuly 14, 2024 I am thinking of you, now, my fellow Americans. We have always been a unique union. America, the fabric of our gentle nation is tattered, but our courage and common sense must ascend and bring us back together as one. When I watched that violent bullet strike my husband, Donald, I realized my life, and Barron\u2019s life, were on the brink of devastating change. I am grateful to the brave secret service agents and law enforcement officials who risked their own lives to protect my husband. To the families of the innocent victims who are now suffering from this heinous act, I humbly offer my sincerest sympathy. Your need to summon your inner strength for such a terrible reason saddens me. A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald\u2019s passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration. The core facets of my husband\u2019s life - his human side - were buried below the political machine. Donald, the generous and caring man who I have been with through the best of times and the worst of times. Let us not forget that differing opinions, policy, and political games are inferior to love. Our personal, structural, and life commitment - until death - is at serious risk. Political concepts are simple when compared to us, human beings. We are all humans, and fundamentally, instinctively, we want to help one another. American politics are only one vehicle that can uplift our communities. Love, compassion, kindness and empathy are necessities. And let us remember that when the time comes to look beyond the left and the right, beyond the red and the blue, we all come from families with the passion to fight for a better life together, while we are here, in this earthly realm. Dawn is here again. Let us reunite. Now. This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence. We all want a world where respect is paramount, family is first, and love transcends. We can realize this world again. Each of us must demand to get it back. We must insist that respect fills the cornerstone of our relationships again. I am thinking of you, my fellow Americans. The winds of change have arrived. For those of you who cry in support, I thank you. I commend those of you who have reached out beyond the political divide \u2013 thank you for remembering that every single politician is a man or a woman with a loving family.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/melania-trump-statement-after-rally-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_takeaways-dismissal-classified-documents-trump-cannon", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision to dismiss Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case on Monday was a surprising end to what was once seen as one of the strongest criminal cases brought against the former president last year. District Judge\u00a0Aileen Cannon said in a 93-page ruling that the case should be tossed out based on her finding that special counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges, was unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Her rationale came purely on technical legal grounds and was not based on specifics of Trump\u2019s alleged actions or the strength or weakness of the charges. In fact, she only mentioned the details about Mar-a-Lago and classified documents in one cursory paragraph within the 93-page ruling. Smith plans to\u00a0appeal the ruling. In a statement issued Monday afternoon, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office, said that the Justice Department approved the plans to pursue an appeal. \u201cThe dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the Attorney General is statutorily authorized to appoint a Special Counsel,\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe Justice Department has authorized the Special Counsel to appeal the court\u2019s order.\u201d But the shock decision by Cannon, a Trump appointee whose handling of the case has drawn widespread scrutiny, still handed an enormous legal and political win to the former president on the same day that the Republican National Convention kicked off in Milwaukee. Trump, soon to be confirmed as the Republican Party\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee, quickly celebrated Cannon\u2019s ruling Monday and, without evidence, again claimed that the now-dismissed case was part of a coordinated political hit job orchestrated by the Justice Department. Here are the takeaways from Cannon\u2019s ruling: Smith\u2019s appointment was unconstitutional, Cannon says Cannon said that Garland\u2019s appointment of Smith in November 2022 violated the US Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause, which gives presidents the power to appoint officials who must then be confirmed by the Senate. Smith\u2019s position, the judge wrote, \u201ceffectively usurps\u201d Congress\u2019 \u201cimportant legislative authority\u201d by giving the executive branch, specifically the Justice Department, the power to appoint an official like him. She concluded that, \u201cAdopting the position of the Special Counsel allows any Attorney General, without Congressional input, to circumvent this statutory scheme and appoint one-off special counsels to wield the immense power of a United States Attorney,\u201d a position that requires Senate confirmation. \u201cIf the political branches wish to grant the Attorney General power to appoint Special Counsel Smith to investigate and prosecute this action with the full powers of a United States Attorney, there is a valid means by which to do so,\u201d Cannon wrote. Defense attorneys had argued to the judge that Garland\u2019s appointment of Smith was unconstitutional, writing in court papers earlier this year that the Appointments Clause does not afford the attorney general the power to appoint \u201cwithout Senate confirmation, a private citizen and like-minded political ally to wield the prosecutorial power of the United States.\u201d In appointing Smith, Garland\u00a0cited a law\u00a0that grants him the authority to appoint officials to investigate matters \u201cas may be directed by the Attorney General.\u201d Trump\u2019s own Attorney General Bill Barr cited the same statute\u00a0to appoint then-special counsel\u00a0John Durham. Cannon says\u00a0Smith\u2019s funding was also unlawful Cannon sided with Trump in his other major contention against Smith\u2019s appointment as well \u2013 that the special counsel should not be receiving indefinite financing to support his prosecution. Trump\u2019s assertion was rooted in the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution. He argued that Smith\u2019s funding cannot come from the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress. \u201cFor more than 18 months, Special Counsel Smith\u2019s investigation and prosecution has been financed by substantial funds drawn from the Treasury without statutory authorization, and to try to rewrite history at this point seems near impossible,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cThe Court has difficulty seeing how a remedy short of dismissal would cure this substantial separation-of-powers violation, but the answers are not entirely self-evident, and the caselaw is not well developed.\u201d The appropriation reserved for independent prosecutors doesn\u2019t apply to Smith because he is not sufficiently independent from the Justice Department, she said. She noted that as of September 2023, Smith\u2019s direct expenditures exceeded $12.8 million. He would have access to additional funds until the end of his investigation. Cannon left open a potential pathway in her ruling for the classified documents case to be revived. The Justice Department \u201ccould reallocate funds to finance the continued operation of Special Counsel Smith\u2019s office,\u201d she wrote, but said it\u2019s not yet clear whether a newly-brought case would pass legal muster. Prosecutors told Cannon in a hearing last month that the Justice Department was \u201cprepared\u201d to fund Smith\u2019s cases through trial if necessary. Smith\u2019s team could also appeal the ruling, though any appellate challenges would make a pre-inauguration trial almost certainly out of reach. Leaning on Clarence Thomas The ruling comes exactly two weeks after Justice Clarence Thomas publicly aired similar doubts about the constitutionality of Smith\u2019s appointment in a concurrence the conservative jurist penned in the blockbuster case granting the former president partial immunity. Cannon leaned on Thomas\u2019 concurrence in her ruling Monday, repeatedly quoting from part of it as she explained her decision to throw out the documents case. In that matter, Thomas sided with Chief Justice John Roberts and the court\u2019s other conservatives in giving Trump some presidential immunity. But Thomas wrote separately to raise questions about whether Garland violated the Constitution when he\u00a0appointed Smith as special counsel, an argument that wasn\u2019t made by Trump\u2019s attorneys before the trial-level judge overseeing that criminal case. \u201cThere are serious questions whether the Attorney General has violated that structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law. Those questions must be answered before this prosecution can proceed,\u201d Thomas wrote in his concurrence in the election case.\u00a0\u201cThe lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment before proceeding.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Justice Thomas wrote his concurrence, which addressed an issue that was not before the Supreme Court, with no awareness that it would be used this way,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Ruling is an outlier that embraced a longshot theory The ruling from Cannon is an outlier that embraced a longshot legal theory that plenty of other judges have already rejected during previous special counsel investigations. President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, attempted earlier this year to throw out his criminal cases based on the same theory that Trump brought before Cannon. (He is being prosecuted by a separate special counsel, David Weiss.) Federal judges in California and Delaware rebuffed his arguments, and federal appeals courts in both jurisdictions refused to get involved. And during the Trump-Russia investigation, multiple Trump allies similarly attempted to derail special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s work. But multiple federal judges in Virginia and Washington, DC, upheld Mueller\u2019s appointment. Still, with all this history, Cannon held a hearing on the issue several weeks ago, pushing attorneys to explain exactly how Smith\u2019s investigation into Trump was being funded. The judge\u2019s questions were so pointed that special counsel attorney James Pearce argued that even if Cannon were to throw out the case due to an appointments clause issue that the Justice Department was \u201cprepared\u201d to fund Smith\u2019s cases through trial if necessary. Smith has DOJ oversight, despite Cannon\u2019s claims In the ruling, Cannon claimed Smith was operating \u201cwith very little oversight or supervision.\u201d She noted that, during last month\u2019s hearing, \u201cthe Special Counsel refused to answer the Court\u2019s questions regarding whether the Attorney General had played any actual role in seeking or approving the indictment in this case.\u201d The federal regulations that govern the special counsel\u2019s office require Smith to coordinate some of his activities with Justice Department leadership. At the hearing, Smith\u2019s team \u201cappeared to acknowledge some degree of actual oversight consistent with the Regulations,\u201d Cannon said. But their tight-lipped answers were clearly not enough to satisfy the judge \u2013 and she pointed out that they \u201cresisted\u201d to offer details. Months before Smith was appointed, the investigation escalated in tremendous fashion in August 2022, when FBI agents raided Mar-a-Lago. The court-approved search turned up troves of documents with classification markings, as prosecutors suspected. Garland later said he \u201cpersonally approved the decision to seek a search warrant,\u201d indicating his hands-on involvement in at least one critical decision in this long-running investigation. At a congressional hearing last month, Garland said he didn\u2019t regret appointing Smith. Under questioning from GOP lawmakers, Garland noted that past judges upheld the legality of Mueller\u2019s appointment during his investigation and that the question \u201chas been adjudicated.\u201d Major legal questions left unanswered Cannon suggested in her ruling that she was leaving some of Trump\u2019s major points in his appropriations clause challenge for review by an appeals court. One of the arguments that Trump raised was that Smith\u2019s appointment gave him a significant amount of power without the oversight of Congress. Former Attorney General Edwin Meese and Citizens United argued the same, writing that Smith\u2019s appointment \u201cseverely undermines\u201d the constitutional order. Cannon wrote in her ruling Monday that the issue was \u201ca point worthy of consideration given the virtually unchecked power given to Special Counsel Smith under the Special Counsel Regulations.\u201d \u201cUltimately, however, after examining the broad language in Supreme Court cases on the subject\u2014and seeing a mixed picture, even if a compelling one in favor of a principal designation\u2014the Court elects, with reservations, to reject the principal-officer submission and to leave the matter for review by higher courts,\u201d she wrote.

{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_trump-injured-pennsylvania-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was wounded Saturday evening while speaking onstage at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in an\u00a0incident that\u2019s being investigated as an assassination attempt from a shooter on a roof near the rally site. Trump was in the middle of delivering his rally speech \u2013 turned toward the right with his hands on his lectern \u2013 when the sound of multiple gunshots suddenly rang out at approximately 6:15 p.m. ET. He said later on social media he was shot in the ear. Trump grabbed his right ear and dropped to the ground as Secret Service agents told him to get down and rushed to the stage, protecting the former president while several more gunshots could be heard. While Trump remained on the ground, there was one last round of shots and loud screams from the crowd. About 45 seconds after the former president was shot, agents were heard on the rally microphone saying, \u201cShooter\u2019s down.\u201d \u201cAre we good to move?\u201d one agent asked. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d asked another. \u201cWe\u2019re clear!\u201d a Secret Service agent said as Trump was lifted to his feet, his face and ear bloodied. The agents prepared to move Trump offstage into his nearby SUV, but he told them to wait. Trump lifted his fist in the air, prompting a loud cheer from the crowd at the rally, and he mouthed the word \u201cfight\u201d three times while pumping his fist. The crowd then chanted \u201cUSA!\u201d as the former president was taken down the stairs by several agents and into his vehicle. One of the rally attendees was killed in the shooting, and and two rally-goers were critically injured, according to the Secret Service. All of the victims were male, according to the FBI. The shocking episode that threatened Trump\u2019s life raises grave questions about security and how the former president was shot at, with lawmakers already calling for an investigation into the Secret Service\u2019s handling of Saturday\u2019s rally. The shooting comes right before Trump is set to accept the 2024 presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention this coming week. President Joe Biden condemned the shooting, saying it was \u201csick,\u201d in remarks from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday evening, and the White House said he later spoke to Trump by phone. Shooter fired multiple times outside the rally venue A law enforcement source and a police officer at the scene told CNN that the shooter was positioned on a building rooftop just outside the venue where Trump was holding his rally, located to the right of the event stage. There was a heavy law enforcement presence around the building. The shooting is being investigated as a possible assassination\u00a0attempt, according to law enforcement officials. The Secret Service said the shooter fired \u201cmultiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue.\u201d The shooter was killed by Secret Service agents, the agency said in a statement. Video posted to social media showed the suspected Trump shooter lying down on the roof of a building, appearing motionless. The FBI is \u201cclose\u201d to identifying the shooter in what they are calling an assassination attempt against Trump, FBI special agent in charge Kevin Rojek said at a press briefing hours after the shooting. Rojek said investigators are close to confirming the identity of the shooter but are not yet releasing the name at this time. Authorities said they believe there Is no other threat. Rojek added that they have not yet identified the shooter\u2019s motive. Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday evening, describing the shooting and thanking the Secret Service and law enforcement for their response. \u201cI was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear. I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d Trump wrote. Map: The distance between the suspected gunman and where Trump was shot is approximately 400-500 feet. \u2018It was a bloody scene\u2019 Rep. Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, was sitting in the front row of Trump\u2019s rally with Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick and Rep. Mike Kelly. The congressman told CNN the spectator, who was fatally shot and killed, was \u201cno more than 20 feet behind\u201d them. \u201cEverybody started, certainly, screaming, asking for a medic, and honestly, it was a bloody scene,\u201d Meuser said. Butler County District Attorney Richard\u00a0Goldinger said he was told by his chief detective that the shooter was on a building adjacent to the property. \u201cIt would have required a rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was several hundred yards.\u201d Rico Elmore, a former Pennsylvania legislative candidate who was a speaker at Saturday\u2019s rally, had blood all over his white shirt and was walking away from the rally stage as he spoke to CNN and described jumping over the barrier and putting his hand on the head of an attendee who was shot and bleeding. \u201cAll we know is shots were fired and then I jumped over the barrier and put my hand on the guy\u2019s head that was profusely bleeding,\u201d Elmore said. He said he didn\u2019t know the attendee and he was \u201cjust a stranger.\u201d Elmore was visibly shaken up but said he was not harmed. He said he only saw one attendee hit and did not see what happened to Trump. Rep. Ronny\u00a0Jackson, a Texas Republican,\u00a0told Fox News that his nephew was injured during the shooting. Jackson\u00a0said his nephew \u201cwas grazed in the neck, a bullet crossed his neck, cut his neck and he was bleeding.\u201d Jackson\u2019s nephew was in \u201cthe friends and family pen, which is to the president\u2019s right, down a little bit lower,\u201d during the rally. The Texas congressman called it a \u201chorrific, horrific experience.\u201d Biden: \u2018It\u2019s sick\u2019 Biden was briefed in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on the shooting. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, Homeland Security\u00a0Secretary Alejandro\u00a0Mayorkas\u00a0and Homeland Security\u00a0adviser\u00a0Liz Sherwood-Randall were part of the team briefing the president. Biden spoke by phone with Trump Saturday evening after the shooting, according to the White House. He also spoke to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Butler Mayor Bob Dandoy. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick,\u201d Biden said before returning to the White House late Saturday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.\u201d Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle quickly weighed after the shooting Saturday expressing their horror, condemning the political violence. Leaders around the world sent their well wishes to the former president. \u201cI have been briefed by law enforcement and am continuing to monitor the developments. This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. \u201cI am horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe. Political violence has no place in our country,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he had spoken with McCormick, the Republican nominee for Senate from Pennsylvania, who was sitting in the front row of the rally. Trump told McCormick to \u201ccome up here onstage,\u201d Urban said, at which point he heard a few \u201cpops\u201d that sounded like \u201cfirecrackers.\u201d McCormick dropped to the ground at that point, and when he got up, he said that Secret Service agents were \u201caround everybody and they were scattering,\u201d according to Urban. McCormick wrote on X that he and his wife, former Trump administration official Dina Powell, \u201care praying for President Trump and all who were injured today in Butler PA.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_trump-shooting-politics-analysis", "text": "The attempted assassination of Donald Trump, which opens a dark new chapter in America\u2019s cursed story of political violence, shook a nation already deeply estranged during one of the most tense periods of its modern history. The targeting of a former president at a campaign rally just days before he accepts the Republican nomination is, by definition, an attack on democracy and the right of each American to choose their leaders. The presumptive GOP nominee was on stage, with supporters as usual behind him in bleachers holding up posters and wearing their MAGA regalia, when shots rang out. He flinched, then grabbed the side of his face and disappeared behind his podium as people started to scream and the surreal nature of what was happening began to dawn. The ex-president later said that he felt a bullet rip through the skin of his ear, which poured with blood as he was rushed from the scene. The shots fired by a gunman on a roof outside the perimeter of his rally at Butler, Pennsylvania, came a fraction of an inch from being a lot worse. A photograph by Evan Vucci of the Associated Press of a defiant but alive Trump \u2013 with blood on his ear and cheek, being rushed off stage by Secret Service agents, fist raised with an American flag in the background \u2013 became instantly iconic. The image will define a fraught political age, whatever the so-far unknowable political aftermath of a sunny afternoon that turned into a nightmare. Horrific associations The pop, pop, pop of gunfire and the sight of a political leader tumbling to the ground \u2013 with Secret Service agents rushing to throw themselves on top of him to shield him \u2013 awoke grave historic traumas. While Trump is not currently serving as president, his wounding underscores the ever-present threat that always hangs over the office and those who run for it \u2013 and especially for those who claim it. President Joe Biden is the 46th president \u2013 and four of his predecessors have been killed while in office, most recently John F. Kennedy in 1963.\u00a0The fact that Trump was attacked ends a 40-year-period in which many have assumed that the Secret Service\u2019s expertise had greatly reduced the potential for such outrages \u2013 and will cast a pall that will last for years. Trump\u2019s targeting during a presidential campaign drew comparisons to the assassination of Democratic candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, a blood-soaked year that also saw the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which will host the same event this year. But political violence hasn\u2019t stopped since then. In 2011, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was left with brain damage after she was shot in the head at an event in which six people were killed. In 2017, a gunman opened fire at a Republican congressional baseball practice,\u00a0shooting then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others. The nation is also still processing the attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021. One Trump supporter at the rally, Joseph Meyn, saw the former president go down and noticed the man who was killed being hit out of the corner of his eye. With eloquence that was remarkable given the shock of what he saw, he told CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene that the attack was a symptom of a country that was consumed by political fury. \u201cEveryone seems very angry. It just seems like there just a lot of angry people out there. I am not shocked that this happened. I am shocked that I was sitting there and it happened next to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just horrible. We should not be at a level of political discourse in this country where this is going to happen.\u201d \u201cJFK, RFK, MLK \u2026 you (had) an attempt (on) the life of Reagan and now you have an attempted assassination of Trump. It is ridiculous. Politics should not be a zero-sum game where someone wins everything and loses everything.\u201d Another stunning twist to an unfathomable election Saturday\u2019s shocking developments added another volatile political element to a wild and unpredictable election year that has recently seen Biden \u2013 the oldest president in history \u2013 fighting to save his nomination after a disastrous debate performance and the conviction of Trump, 78, by a New York jury and his vows to wage a second term of \u201cretribution\u201d if he\u2019s reelected. The only appropriate initial reaction to the horror was relief that a contender for the presidency is still alive and mourning for the Trump supporter who was killed while exercising their democratic freedoms at the rally. Most leaders and political actors from both sides of the aisle quickly sent prayers to Trump and called for calm. Biden, who has spent days trying to shore up his campaign, swung into his role as the nation\u2019s chief executive after learning of the shooting while he was at mass in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He released a paper statement and then spoke to the nation on camera. \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence \u2013 it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s sick, it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this,\u201d Biden said. He also said that he\u2019d tried to reach \u201cDonald\u201d by phone and said that the ex-president had been at rally that \u201cshould have been able to be conducted peacefully without any problem.\u201d The president, who later was able to connect with his predecessor, ended his weekend at his beach house early and returned to Washington. Given the viciously polarized state of politics in the United States, the initial shock of the assassination attempt will inevitably cause serious political ramifications. Trump was already viewed as an unvanquishable hero by his supporters and treated with almost supernatural reverence at his rallies. His image as a fighter who is constantly under attack from his enemies will now be entrenched even more deeply. In a moment of self-possession after he was hit, the former president made sure to create an iconic moment of defiance \u2013 raising his fist and shouting \u201cfight, fight\u201d to his crowd \u2013 looking directly at the bank of television cameras on a riser. The images will stand in history and enrich Trump\u2019s mythology just as surely as the picture of his mug shot in at Atlanta jail and the footage of his return to the White House in 2020 after beating a serious Covid-19 infection. There could also be unpredictable implications for an election campaign in which Trump was leading Biden \u2013 even before the president\u2019s campaign went into free fall with his disastrous debate performance. And the atmosphere around the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week will be even more intense. Already on Saturday, there were calls for investigations of how a gunman \u2013 outside the security perimeter of the rally \u2013 was able to get Trump in his sights in a massive failure of security that will rumble on for months and will have implications for all future presidential and campaign events. Many politicians on both sides of the aisle are already bemoaning the heat of political rhetoric \u2013 after yet another chilling indication of what it can produce in a nation in which guns are so easily accessed. It remains to be seen if the shock of Saturday\u2019s events, which could have been a lot worse, will do anything to tame a toxic political culture in which Trump is an enthusiastic participant. In one of the most poignant reactions, Giffords said in a statement, \u201cPolitical violence is terrifying. I know.\u201d\u00a0She added: \u201cI\u2019m holding former President Trump, and all those affected by today\u2019s indefensible act of violence in my heart. Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable \u2013 never.\u201d Unfortunately, history suggests that violence, while indefensible, is also a quintessential scar on American politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/trump-shooting-politics-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_fact-check-night-one-republican-national-convention", "text": "CNN\u2019s team is fact-checking the first night of the Republican National Convention. We will continue to update this list throughout the night. North Carolina gubernatorial candidate\u2019s economic claims Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson of North Carolina, now running for governor, made a series of economic claims in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Monday. One about the Biden era was misleading, while another about the Trump era touted pre-pandemic statistics without acknowledging that when Trump left office the economy was in much worse shape. Robinson said that under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, \u201cgrocery prices have skyrocketed, and gas has nearly doubled.\u201d Facts First: It is true that grocery prices have jumped by over 20% since Biden was sworn in, but gas prices aren\u2019t double what they were when he took office.  The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.52 on Monday, according to AAA. When Biden was inaugurated, the national average was $2.39. Robinson also claimed that under former President Donald Trump, unemployment was \u201cat a historic low.\u201d That was certainly true prior to the pandemic. For instance, in February 2020, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate was at 3.5%, the lowest since the late 1960s.By comparison, the average monthly unemployment rate over the past decade was 4.8%.But when Trump left office, it was at 6.4%, far from historic lows. From CNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald\u00a0 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s misleading claim about Biden-era job growth In her speech at the Republican National Convention, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia claimed of Democrats: \u201cThey claim that our economy is thriving, yet hundreds of thousands of American-born workers lost their jobs these past few years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is misleading at best.\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics figures\u00a0show\u00a0that the number of American-born workers with jobs has grown significantly during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. About 130.9 million American-born workers were employed in June, an increase of nearly 4.7 million since June 2021, shortly after Biden took office. (This data is not seasonally adjusted, so we have to look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, the month Biden was sworn in, about 123 million American-born workers were employed.) There is always churn in the labor market, so it\u2019s certainly possible that hundreds of thousands of individual American-born workers lost their jobs during this period \u2013 but contrary to Greene\u2019s insinuation, there have been far greater gains than losses under Biden for American-born workers as a group. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Tami Luhby\u00a0 Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Transgender Day of Visibility Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said while attacking Democrats in her convention speech Monday that\u00a0\u201cthe establishment in Washington\u201d held Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter this year. \u201cThey promised normalcy and gave us Transgender Visibility Day on Easter Sunday,\u201d the Georgia Republican said. Facts first: This claim needs context. Transgender Day of Visibility has been held annually on March 31 since it was started in 2009 as a day of awareness to celebrate the successes of transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the first day of spring and can change year to year. The holiday happened to fall on March 31 in 2024. Responding to Republicans criticizing President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in an April 1 briefing said she was \u201csurprised by the misinformation\u201d surrounding Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility falling on the same day. \u201cEvery year, for the past several years, on March 31, Transgender Day of Visibility is marked.\u00a0And as we know \u2014 for folks who understand the calendar and how it works, Easter falls on different Sundays every year. And this year, it happened to coincide with Transgender Visibility Day.\u00a0 And so, that is the simple fact,\u201d she said. From CNN\u2019s Jack Forrest\u00a0 RNC video falsely claims Trump signed largest tax cuts ever A video played at the Republican National Convention featured a narrator making the claim that former President Donald Trump \u201cgave us the largest tax cuts in history.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is false. Analyses have found that Trump\u2019s\u00a02017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates. In a report released in June, the\u00a0federal government\u2019s nonpartisan\u00a0Congressional Budget Office\u00a0looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger \u2013 former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy \u2013 over five years. Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut and Obama\u2019s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the\u00a0eighth largest\u00a0since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product. From CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby Republican chair falsely claims Middle East was \u2018at peace\u2019 four years ago Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in his speech at the party\u2019s convention on Monday: \u201cFour years ago, Europe and the Middle East were at peace.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Whatley\u2019s claim is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East four years ago in mid-2020 and when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Millercalled \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video attacks Biden with two-year-old gas price figure The Republican National Convention featured a video attacking President Joe Biden over the price of gas. But the video misleadingly deployed out-of-date figures as if they were current. A narrator claimed:\u00a0\u201cWhen President Trump left office, gas cost only $2.20. Under Biden and Harris, gas skyrocketed to the highest price in history, over five bucks a gallon.\u201d Later in the video, a young man said, \u201cWithin my first year of driving, I\u2019m having to deal with an average of $5.03 across the nation,\u201d and a woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to pay $5.03. We need to care about our people better than that.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0These claims about Biden-era gas prices are two years out of date. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.52 on Monday,\u00a0according to the AAA.\u00a0The national average did, under Biden,\u00a0hit a record high of more than $5 per gallon \u2013 about $5.02,\u00a0according to AAA data\u00a0\u2013 but that happened in June 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u00a0triggered a global spike in oil prices. The RNC videos offered no indication that the national average has since fallen substantially. Also, the national average on the day Trump left office in January 2021\u00a0was about $2.39 per gallon, not $2.20, though it was lower than $2.20 in some states. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video doesn\u2019t mention Trump was president during one of the years Americans\u2019 incomes dropped A video played during the Republican National Convention, which attacked President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Wall Street Journal has reported today that Americans\u2019 incomes have gone down three straight years.\u201d Facts First: This needs context. The RNC video left out an inconvenient fact from the Wall Street Journal report that was published in 2023: one of the three straight years in which inflation-adjusted median household income went down was 2020, when Donald Trump was president. The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline, but the ad failed to explain that not all of the three years were under Biden. Real median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites outdated inflation figure Attacking President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the economy, the Republican National Convention featured a video in which a narrator said, \u201cAmerica has reached the highest inflation in 40 years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This claim is two years out of date. The year-over-year inflation rate in June 2022,\u00a0about 9.1%, was indeed the highest since late 1981, between 40 and 41 years prior. But inflation has\u00a0declined sharply\u00a0since that Biden-era peak, and the most recent available rate,\u00a0for June 2024, was\u00a0about\u00a03.0%\u00a0\u2013 a rate that, the Biden presidency aside, was\u00a0exceeded as recently as 2011.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_vance-trump-political-heir-analysis", "text": "JD Vance is the embodiment of the populist, nationalist and blue-collar transformation of the old establishment Republican Party. That\u2019s why ex-President Donald Trump \u2014 who never forgets the enthusiasms of his base \u2014 picked the Ohio senator as his vice-presidential running mate and effectively named him as a political heir who is now the best positioned Republican to inherit the keys to the MAGA kingdom whenever Trump exits. Trump rarely comes across as someone preoccupied with posterity \u2014 he lives in the present. But the selection of Vance is a nod to his legacy and anoints a leader of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement who could be active long after its author has left the scene. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that Trump chose an heir apparent a few days after surviving an assassination attempt \u2014 a horrific event that underscored the constitutional duty of vice presidents to secure the chain of power and assume the presidency themselves if the worst happens. The Ohio senator, who is only 39, injects a dash of youth into an election season dominated by two elderly men who have both been elected president. His selection caps a stunning political rise \u2014 he\u2019s been in the Senate for less than two years. And if Trump wins the election in November, a millennial will be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Vance made his name by explaining the political forces behind the rise of Trumpism before most people were paying attention to them in his book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d about growing up poor in Appalachia. The memoir describes human blight, economic pain and drug addiction sown by deindustrialization and globalization in Kentucky and Ohio. Eight years ago, he was often sought out by liberal commentators looking to understand Trumpism\u2019s populist appeal. In many ways, his quintessential American story is the antidote to Trump\u2019s biography. Unlike his new boss, he didn\u2019t come from wealth \u2014 he\u2019s a self-made man who rose from the lowliest of circumstances, heading to the Ohio State University, to service with the Marine Corps in Iraq and graduating with top honors from Yale Law School. Vance is exceedingly smart and eloquent and makes a case for Trumpism and his party\u2019s revolutionary departure from its internationalist, corporate roots in a way that Trump, who operates on emotion and feral political instincts, embodies but rarely intellectualizes. From Never Trumper to true believer But Vance was not always on the Trump train. He was an early, self-declared \u201cNever Trumper\u201d who once called the ex-president \u201cnoxious.\u201d Critics, therefore, accuse him of opportunism and of trashing his beliefs to become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal sycophants in the pursuit of power. The Ohio Republican has turned on the establishment and elite academe that helped make his name with the vehemence that only a defector can muster. But he has explained that he was wrong about Trump and now believes that he was a great president. Since Trump left the White House, Vance has emerged as one of his most vehement defenders and has enthusiastically embraced the idea that the ex-president is the victim of weaponized justice. He has also downplayed the assault on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, and in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins earlier this year, cast doubt on the facts of the most flagrant attack on American democracy of the modern age. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger. I think \u2026\u00a0in politics, people like to really exaggerate things, from time to time,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of folks, in the Democratic Party act as if January the 6 was the scariest moment of their lives.\u201d Vance went on: \u201cJanuary 6 was a bad day. It was a riot. But the idea that Donald Trump endangered anyone\u2019s lives, when he told them to protest peacefully, it\u2019s just absurd.\u201d But while Vance may juice MAGA turnout, he could alienate the critical suburban voters in swing states, especially women, who usually decide US elections, especially with his hardline position on abortion. Trump critics are also seizing on the pick to question Trump\u2019s commitment to his new unity message after he escaped the assassination attempt. Vance responded with the most searing reaction of any Republican. He claimed that President Joe Biden\u2019s arguments that Trump was an \u201cauthoritarian fascist\u201d led to the attempt to kill him, despite the motive of the gunman being unclear. There is always intense debate about how much a vice-presidential nominee really matters in an electoral context and whether such picks really help put a ticket over the top. But the Vance move makes a lot of sense when Biden\u2019s own team has said his best path to a second term runs through the Blue Wall states. Most assessments of the electoral map suggest Biden must at a minimum win those states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and add a single electoral vote in the Omaha, Nebraska, area to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Vance has a particular talent for talking to voters in the post-industrial Midwest. He won his Senate seat by more than 6 points in 2022 and he is an avatar for the political forces that turned the Buckeye State into a Republican bastion after years as a political bellwether. Why European allies won\u2019t relish the Vance pick The new Republican vice-presidential pick is also the embodiment of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies abroad and augurs another rocky period between the US and its European allies if the ex-president reclaims the Oval Office. He is in the vanguard of a new generation of pro-Trump lawmakers who reject the traditional US foreign policy consensus. He traveled to the belly of the internationalist beast at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year to rebuke America\u2019s European allies. And at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US, he explained why he thinks America should no longer finance Ukraine\u2019s fight for its freedom. \u201cI have \u2026 Republican colleagues, who are much more emotionally invested in what\u2019s going on 6,000 miles away than they are in their own country,\u201d Vance said at the conference. He backs Trump\u2019s position that the war in Ukraine should end and the killing should stop. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the country to have somebody saying, \u2018How long does this go on? How much money are we supposed to funnel into this country?\u2019\u201d said Vance, who has also argued the US lacks the manufacturing capacity or sufficient military reserves to send more ammunition to Ukraine. \u201cIf you care about Ukraine, but most importantly, if you care about America, you should be wanting this thing to come to some diplomatic resolution.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked Vance\u2019s criticism of the war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Collins in February. \u201cTo understand it is to come to the front line to see what\u2019s going on, to speak with the people, then to go to civilians to understand \u2026 what will (happen to) them without this support. And he will understand that millions \u2026 will be killed. It\u2019s a fact,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cOf course, he doesn\u2019t understand. God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory,\u201d he said. But Vance is listening to Trump, not Zelensky or the foreign policy establishment. It\u2019s not hard to imagine him deep in the West Wing as vice president implementing the hardline \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda at home and abroad, almost like a modern day \u2014 and far more populist \u2014 version of former Vice President Dick Cheney in the Bush administration. Ultimately, Trump is clearly comfortable with Vance, a favorite of his firebrand son Donald Trump Jr. They are cut from the same ideological and temperamental cloth \u2014 unlike the ex-president and his first vice presidential pick, the pious Mike Pence, who eventually broke with Trump on January 6 after concluding he lacked the constitutional power to throw the 2020 election to his boss. \u201cI think he was a good president. And I think that he made the country more prosperous. And I think he made the world more peaceful,\u201d Vance said of his future ticket mate in his interview with Collins, saying,\u00a0 \u201cWhat gives me pause is another four years of Biden\u2019s administration, where he\u2019s opened the borders, and where you have, effectively a conflict, a major world conflict in nearly every continent in the world.\u201d There is little distance between Vance and Trump. The Ohio senator made sure of that and it\u2019s made him one of the most significant rising powers in American politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/vance-trump-political-heir-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "politics"}}
