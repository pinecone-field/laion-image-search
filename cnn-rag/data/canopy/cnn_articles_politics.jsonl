{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_lgbtq-title-ix-ohio-virginia", "text": "The Biden administration cannot enforce new protections for LGBTQ+ students in Ohio, Virginia and four other states, a federal judge ruled Monday, becoming the latest court to rebuff efforts to expand the scope of a decades-old law that prohibits sex-based discrimination. US District Judge Danny Reeves said in a 93-page ruling that the new protections \u2013 which are set to take effect August 1 \u2013 cannot be enforced in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia and West Virginia while a lawsuit brought by those states\u2019 attorneys general plays out. The new rules require schools to protect students from all sex discrimination, including sexual violence and sex-based harassment, expanding that definition to include discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions like childbirth, termination of pregnancy\u00a0or recovery from pregnancy. Compliance with the new rules is required to receive federal education aid. Among other things, the changes made by the Biden administration to Title IX \u2013 the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid \u2013 aim to curb discrimination \u201cbased on sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics,\u201d\u00a0according to the Department of Education. But in his ruling Monday, Reeves, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said the Department of Education \u201cwould turn Title IX on its head by redefining \u2018sex\u2019 to include \u2018gender identity.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe Department\u2019s interpretation conflicts with the plain language of Title IX and therefore exceeds its authority to promulgate regulations under that statute,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he also believed the changes would, in effect, require some educators \u201cto use students\u2019 preferred pronouns regardless of whether doing so conflicts with the educator\u2019s religious or moral beliefs.\u201d The decision comes days after a separate judge similarly blocked the administration from enforcing the protections in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana and Idaho. Several other challenges are pending in federal courts across the country. A spokesperson for the Department\u00a0of Education referred Monday to its reaction issued after last week\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe Department crafted the final Title IX regulations following a rigorous process to realize the Title IX statutory guarantee,\u201d the spokesperson, Vanessa Harmoush, said in a statement. \u201cThe Department stands by the final Title IX regulations released in April 2024, and we will continue to fight for every student.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/lgbtq-title-ix-ohio-virginia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters", "text": "Hunter Biden has never sought elective office or been part of a presidential administration, but he has loomed large in the American political conversation for years. His conviction in Delaware, the first federal criminal trial of a president\u2019s son in US history, is for allegedly lying on a federal firearms background check and owning a firearm for 11 days in 2018 at a time when he was addicted to drugs and could land him behind bars. It has put a personal drama of addiction and betrayal in the public eye, an unwanted embarrassment for the Biden family. Read more from CNN\u2019s team covering the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, his ex-girlfriend, his brother\u2019s widow \u2013 with whom he had an affair \u2013 and his daughter all testified. Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction will also serve as a sort of foil for former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction for lying on business records in New York. That\u2019s not to equate the two sets of charges or the trials. Trump was convicted for hiding his compensation of hush money paid to keep an alleged affair out of the media during the 2016 presidential campaign. He is also running again in the 2024 presidential election, while Hunter Biden is now an artist. Hunter Biden also faces tax evasion charges in Los Angeles later this year, another case brought by the former Trump-appointed US attorney turned special counsel whose planned plea deal with Biden to settle both the gun and tax problems imploded last year when a Trump-appointed judge refused to accept it. Trump feared a Joe Biden candidacy ahead of the 2020 election, and hoping to tarnish Biden\u2019s reputation, in 2019 he tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to spin up an investigation of Joe Biden and his son. Trump pushed Zelensky to focus on Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as vice president, at a time when Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma. Joe Biden was one of many Western leaders who had advocated for the ouster of a prosecutor in Ukraine because he was not pursuing corruption cases. Read a CNN fact check about Trump\u2019s Ukraine claims. Democrats impeached Trump (the first of two times) for improperly dragging a foreign leader into US politics. Trump was acquitted in the Senate. But that bad experience did nothing to stop Trump or Republicans from making allegations about Hunter Biden. At the Republican presidential debate in 2020, Trump brought up Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and also alleged that he was \u201cdishonorably discharged\u201d from the Navy Reserve for cocaine use, which is not true. Hunter Biden was administratively discharged, which is standard procedure when an officer fails a drug test. Read a CNN fact check about the discharge claim. In fact, if you search \u201cHunter Biden\u201d in the CNN Facts First database, there are many results. Among them: Did Hunter Biden have a job before his father became vice president? Yes. Did Joe Biden profit from his son Hunter\u2019s career? There\u2019s no evidence. What is Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship with China? He did business with Chinese partners. The sheer volume of these fact checks is worth noting as proof, if nothing else, that he is so frequently cited by his father\u2019s political opponents.  When Republicans narrowly took control of the House of Representatives in January 2023, one of their high-profile moves was to launch an official impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, most of it built on trying to tie the president to his son\u2019s former business career. While House Republicans have referred Hunter Biden and his uncle James Biden for criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading Congress, the impeachment inquiry has seemingly fallen apart without unanimous support from Republicans and no evidence of wrongdoing by the president. For Hunter Biden, his name is both a blessing and a curse. It was with help from his last name that he built a lucrative career as an attorney, then lobbyist, who then  did business with companies in Ukraine and China. It is because of his name that he has been so scrutinized. It is a trade-off Hunter Biden has been experiencing for years. When Joe Biden was tapped as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008, they made a point about not consorting with lobbyists. Hunter, then a lobbyist, ended his lucrative lobbying contracts a few months before the election that year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/republicans-hunter-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_civilian-mariner-missing-houthi-attack", "text": "US forces launched successful attacks late this week on Houthi radars that helped facilitate the Iranian-backed group\u2019s ongoing assaults on ships in the Red Sea, according to US Central Command. CENTCOM said the US military destroyed seven radars in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, which had allowed\u00a0\u201cHouthis\u00a0to target maritime vessels and endanger commercial shipping.\u201d The strikes followed a Wednesday Houthi attack on a Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated ship that left one civilian mariner\u00a0missing. The attack on the ship caused severe flooding and damage to the engine room, CENTCOM said. The crew abandoned ship and was rescued by US and partner forces, including the USS Philippine Sea. The cargo ship is still in the Red Sea and is taking on water, CENTCOM said. The ship is drifting from its last reported position, according to the UK Maritime Trade Operations. In addition to the attacks on the radars, US forces destroyed one uncrewed aerial system launched from Yemen and two uncrewed surface vessels in the Red Sea, according to the CENTCOM statement. The Houthis have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack. On Thursday, Iran-backed Houthi militants struck another cargo ship, the M/V Verbena, in two separate missile attacks in the Gulf of Aden, severely injuring a civilian mariner and causing fires on board, according to CENTCOM. The wounded mariner from the M/V Verbena was medically evacuated by aircraft from a nearby US warship. Two days later, the crew issued a distress call indicating it was abandoning the ship \u201cdue to continued fires and an inability to control them,\u201d CENTCOM said Saturday. Another commercial ship responded to the distress signal and is transporting the mariners to safety. Notably, the Iranian frigate IRIN Jamaran was 8 nautical miles from the M/V Verbena and did not respond to the distress call, CENTCOM said in a statement on X. \u201cThis continued reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement earlier this week. \u201cThe ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.\u201d The US and UK have carried out several rounds of strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including as recently as last week, to try to degrade their weapons supplies. But the Houthis have shown no signs of halting their attacks. \u201cThe United States will continue to act with partners to hold the Houthis accountable and degrade their military capabilities,\u201d CENTCOM said. This story has been updated with new reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_trump-campaign-turning-point-charlie-kirk", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is taking a vastly different approach to\u00a02024\u00a0compared with\u00a02020,\u00a0with plans\u00a0for fewer staff and expenses, including what the campaign views as superfluous brick-and-mortar\u00a0offices. Instead,\u00a0the campaign pledges\u00a0to run\u00a0a more efficient operation that will lean heavily on data modeling, microtargeting and relying on wealthy conservative groups for\u00a0data, infrastructure\u00a0and significant bank accounts to help find Trump a pathway to the 270\u00a0electoral votes\u00a0needed to secure victory in November. \u201c(The) ability to work with outside groups on field work alleviates the need to have the same size staff footprint as in previous cycles, allowing us to retain a greater share of resources for advertising and paid voter contact programs than in past cycles,\u201d a senior Trump adviser told CNN. Of those groups, perhaps one of the most important is Turning Point Action, which is hosting Trump in Michigan on Saturday. It will be his second engagement with the organization in\u00a0as many\u00a0weeks. Turning Point\u00a0was one of several groups that sat down with campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and James Blair during a donor retreat earlier in the year that focused on how outside groups could best assist Trump\u2019s reelection effort. TPA \u2014 an affiliate of Turning Point USA, the youth organization started by Trump ally Charlie Kirk \u2014 is aiming to ultimately spend $108 million on a get-out-the-vote effort in key battleground states, according to two sources familiar with the plans.\u00a0The \u201cChase the Vote\u201d program has built out infrastructures in Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states that Trump won in 2016 but\u00a0lost to President Joe Biden in 2020.\u00a0While Trump speaks to the crowd\u00a0this weekend,\u00a0the group is planning to sign up more local volunteers as well as pass out job applications to beef up their program, particularly in the Wolverine State. Democratic operatives have mocked Trump\u2019s campaign for their limited hired staff on the ground, as Biden\u2019s team has continued to build out\u00a0its own\u00a0massive ground game operation. \u201cYou need boots on the ground to win an election,\u201d said one veteran Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201c(The Biden campaign) is far outpacing Trump\u2019s operation on this front.\u201d But Trump\u2019s team members insist they do have people on the ground \u2014 they just aren\u2019t all paid by the campaign. The TPA program is built around \u201crelational organizing,\u201d a form of community organizing that requires hired \u201cballot chasers,\u201d full-time staff who are trained to build relationships with specific members of the community and ensure they vote in the upcoming election. Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, TPA\u2019s chief operating officer, created the program after Republicans faced major losses in the 2022 election. Using data from the last several election cycles, TPA has identified thousands of right-leaning low propensity voters \u2014 including voters who have voted for a Republican in recent cycles, but did not cast a ballot in 2020 or 2022 and cannot be relied on to show up in November.\u00a0Many of these voters are in Republican districts. \u201cThe prevailing wisdom of the consultant class before was, \u2018Let\u2019s go to those swing districts and really try and move those voters.\u2019 Well, we don\u2019t agree,\u201d one source familiar with the plans told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going where the Republicans are. We\u2019re going to drive up score in those areas and get the people that stayed home in 2020 or 2022.\u201d Ballot chasers are hired locally and given a list of 400 to 600 of these voters that they are responsible for getting to the polls this cycle however they can, within the law of the state \u2014 including driving them to cast their ballots, helping mail their ballots and encouraging early voting. \u201cWe want them to be the mayor of their territory,\u201d\u00a0TPA spokesman\u00a0Andrew Kolvet said. \u201cThey\u2019re throwing BBQs in the park, they\u2019re getting to know their neighbors, they\u2019re hosting local events so that when voting month comes along, they already have a relationship with these individuals so they can get as many pieces of paper in the ballot box as they can.\u201d \u201cThe 2020\u00a0election was decided by a handful of voters in three states. TPA plans to engage with hundreds of thousands of voters in these states,\u201d Kolvet added. The approach\u00a0of relying\u00a0on outside groups is untested.\u00a0Advisers said this would be unlike any other traditional campaign strategy in modern history \u2014 only made possible by a recent Federal Election Commission ruling that allows campaigns to directly work and coordinate with outside groups.\u00a0It\u2019s also born out of a crucial challenge the Trump campaign has yet to solve for: money. Trump\u2019s campaign has struggled for months to keep pace with Biden\u2019s growing war chest amid the former president\u2019s ever mounting legal fees. Republican operatives described the effort as valiant but risky. \u201cYou are placing a lot of a trust in these (outside groups), who might be hard to manage,\u201d said one operative, who spoke on condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. A former RNC official who also requested anonymity to speak candidly said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a presence being built up, they don\u2019t have a footprint. They have a handful of staffers in the states.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a messaging war,\u201d the former official said.\u00a0\u201cThis is going to be a turnout fight \u2026 when you don\u2019t have people out there building relationships and you don\u2019t have the intense infrastructure, you don\u2019t have as many offices, you don\u2019t have as many bodies. \u2026 It seems that they are miscalculating how this election is going to be won.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-campaign-turning-point-charlie-kirk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

What\u00a0he\u2019s talking\u00a0about\u00a0is\u00a0outrageous.\u201d The fundraiser, which featured former President Barack Obama, raised more than $30 million for Biden\u2019s reelection efforts, a campaign official told CNN. The conversation between Biden and Obama was moderated by television host Jimmy Kimmel. Biden\u00a0specifically argued on Saturday evening that the next four years could see openings on the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court, potentially leading to the\u00a0appointment\u00a0of\u00a0more conservative justices if\u00a0Trump\u00a0is reelected. \u201cThe idea\u00a0that if he\u2019s reelected he\u2019s going to\u00a0appoint two more flying flags upside down,\u201d\u00a0Biden said in\u00a0an\u00a0apparent reference to\u00a0a\u00a0flag that once flew\u00a0outside the home\u00a0of\u00a0Justice Samuel\u00a0Alito.\u00a0Asked by Kimmel whether he considered this the scariest part\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0second Trump\u00a0term,\u00a0Biden\u00a0responded, \u201cIt is one\u00a0of\u00a0the scariest parts.\u201d \u201cThe\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court\u00a0has\u00a0never been\u00a0as\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0kilter\u00a0as\u00a0it is today, I mean never,\u201d the president said, discussing the ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and how Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0said other rulings could be reconsidered, including on contraception. Someone in the crowd interjected, \u201cincluding gay rights,\u201d to which\u00a0Biden\u00a0responded, \u201cNot on my watch.\u201d The Biden campaign has been looking to boost his financial war chest amid signs Trump is narrowing the money gap. Biden has led Trump in fundraising for most of the year, but the former president has seen a significant influx in cash come his way since securing the Republican nomination in March. Trump outraised Biden for the first time in April. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to just vote\u00a0against something in this election,\u201d Obama\u00a0said. \u201cWe have someone to worry\u00a0about.\u00a0And there\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0whole\u00a0agenda\u00a0that we should be concerned\u00a0about. But we can take pride in\u00a0affirming the extraordinary work that Joe has\u00a0done.\u201d First lady Dr. Jill Biden, who also spoke at the event, touched on similar themes, saying that her husband \u201chonors the rule of law instead of trying to bend it to his own will. And rallies the world to fight for democracy and freedom.\u201d She also made the case for the dangers of a second Trump term, saying, \u201cTrump has told us again and again why he wants the White House. To give himself absolute power. To not be held accountable for his criminal actions. \u2026 To destroy the democratic safeguards that stand in his way.\u201d The first lady suggested that Trump is a bully, saying, \u201cWhen bullies threaten our loved ones, we don\u2019t just stand by.\u201d She added that those in attendance were showing Trump \u201cexactly how we deal with bullies. \u2026 We don\u2019t cower, we don\u2019t turn away. We show up. We speak up.\u201d Obama appeals to \u2018core values\u2019 Obama\u00a0lamented how some in the country have \u201cnormalized behavior that used to be disqualifying,\u201d referencing\u00a0Trump\u2019s recent conviction in his criminal hush money trial. \u201cWe have the spectacle\u00a0of\u00a0the nominee\u00a0of\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the two major parties sitting in\u00a0court\u00a0and being convicted by\u00a0a\u00a0jury\u00a0of\u00a0his peers on 34 counts,\u201d Obama\u00a0said to\u00a0applause. \u201cHis foundation is not\u00a0allowed to operate because it was\u00a0engaging in monkey business. \u2026 You have his organization being prosecuted for not paying taxes,\u201d Obama\u00a0said. Biden\u00a0interjected, \u201cHe paid none.\u201d When Kimmel\u00a0asked\u00a0Biden\u00a0about\u00a0\u201cTrump\u00a0amnesia,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said: \u201cAll you got to do is remember what it was\u00a0like\u201d during\u00a0Trump\u2019s four years, pointing\u00a0to\u00a0Trump\u2019s recommendation that\u00a0people inject bleach to cure Covid-19. Obama\u00a0also urged \u201cthose who\u00a0are conservatively predisposed\u201d \u2014 who may not\u00a0agree with Democrats \u2014 to consider the \u201ccore values\u201d that shaped the country, like \u201cbasic honesty.\u201d Kimmel\u00a0asked Obama\u00a0how he felt\u00a0about\u00a0Trump\u00a0saying he\u2019s done more for Black people than\u00a0any president in history. Obama\u00a0replied \u201cOne thing he did, for example, was\u00a0make them feel even better\u00a0about\u00a0the first Black president.\u201d Jokes fly at star-studded event George Clooney\u00a0and Julia\u00a0Roberts opened up the night\u2019s program. Barbra\u00a0Streisand introduced first lady Jill\u00a0Biden\u00a0while Jason Bateman, Jack Black, Kathryn Hahn\u00a0and Sheryl Lee Ralph\u00a0also entertained the crowd.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_abortion-judge-matthew-kacsmaryk-supreme-court-mifepristone", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week rebuffing an effort to restrict access to mifepristone is unlikely to be the final word on the abortion pill \u2013 and the next person to speak will almost certainly be a Trump-appointed judge in Texas at the center of the controversy. US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk will have to decide later this summer if three conservative states that want to continue the fight against the drug can do so in his court. The decision is one of several in coming weeks that will determine whether \u2013 and if so, how quickly \u2013 the case against mifepristone makes it back to the Supreme Court. Kacsmaryk, a Donald Trump appointee who previously worked for a Christian legal advocacy group, drew national attention last year by invalidating the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, a sweeping decision that would have removed the drug from the market entirely. Now, both sides in the abortion debate are gearing up for the case to return to his Amarillo courtroom. \u201cThis fight isn\u2019t over,\u201d said Carrie Flaxman, a senior legal advisor at Democracy Forward who has long represented reproductive rights groups. \u201cAccess to this medication very much remains at risk.\u201d A unanimous Supreme Court on Thursday swatted away the current challenge to mifepristone access without reaching the merits of the case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, wrote that the anti-abortion doctors and groups that sued over the drug didn\u2019t have standing because they were not injured by its use. But the court\u2019s decision left open the possibility that some other entity might be positioned to challenge the steps the Food and Drug Administration took in 2016 and 2021 to loosen certain limits on the drug. Those actions included allowing mifepristone to be mailed to patients without a doctor\u2019s visit and allowing it to be used longer in a pregnancy. \u201cIt is not clear that no one else would have standing to challenge FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. By spiking the claims on procedural grounds, the high court avoided weighing in on the merits of the anti-abortion advocates\u2019 arguments about how the pill has been regulated. If opponents of the abortion pill can overcome the procedural hurdles to get the justices to consider the substance of their case, they may find some sympathy with the conservative majority that just two years ago overturned Roe v. Wade. Where Biden\u2019s policies go to die Even before the Supreme Court decided the case, three conservative states \u2013 Missouri, Idaho and Kansas \u2013 had sought to intervene to challenge the drug alongside the doctors and anti-abortion groups. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said he is \u201cmoving forward undeterred\u201d with his effort to pursue the case in Texas. An immediate question for Kacsmaryk is whether the states can continue to do so in his court. Generally, parties must be able to justify filing lawsuits in a specific federal court. The doctors and anti-abortion groups who sued over mifepristone incorporated a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine in Amarillo\u00a0 months before their lawsuit. The groups\u2019 move to bring the case in Amarillo, a far-flung court division in Texas\u2019 panhandle, was among the most controversial aspects of the lawsuit. Kacsmaryk is virtually guaranteed to hear every case that is filed there, and his courthouse has become a favorite option for conservative litigants and states seeking to halt the Biden administration\u2019s agenda. On the bench, Kacsmaryk has handed down a series of rulings killing policies from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. He has ruled against the administration\u2019s attempt to end the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, for instance, and rejected its effort to use a provision of Obamacare to protect gay and transgender healthcare workers from discrimination. Earlier this month, Kacsmaryk blocked the Biden administration from enforcing in four states a federal rule that requires\u202fpeople who sell firearms online and at gun shows to conduct background checks on their potential customers. In the mifepristone case, Kacsmaryk\u2019s initial ruling was notable not just for its sweeping nature but in how he embraced the anti-abortion movement\u2019s sensational rhetoric about the procedure. Kacsmaryk\u2019s decision on mifepristone was later narrowed by a federal appeals court to deal only with the subsequent steps the FDA took to make mifepristone easier to obtain. As the administration\u2019s appeal of Kacsmaryk\u2019s abortion ruling played out at the Supreme Court, the trial judge granted the three states\u2019 bid to intervene in the legal challenge in his court. With the Supreme Court now ruling that the underlying litigation must be tossed because the doctors and groups don\u2019t have standing to sue, it\u2019s not clear that Missouri would be able to continue its lawsuit in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court in Texas. \u201cThis lawsuit should not be permitted to continue in Amarillo, because now that the Supreme Court has found that the original plaintiffs lacked standing, that means the case was defective from the start,\u201d Julia Kaye, senior staff attorney for the ACLU, said. The groups fighting mifepristone argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision shouldn\u2019t affect the states\u2019 ability to sue. The \u201cruling does not impact the states below,\u201d said Erin Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative group that represented the doctors at the Supreme Court. \u201cI would expect the litigation to continue with those states raising different standing arguments than made by our doctors.\u201d Aides to the attorneys general in Missouri, Idaho and Kansas did not respond to a request for comment. If Kacsmaryk decides that those states cannot continue their lawsuit in his courthouse in Texas, those attorneys general \u2013 and perhaps Republican leaders of other states \u2013 may look for a friendly courthouse elsewhere to file a similar challenge. However, in most federal courthouses in other states, their lawsuit would be randomly assigned to one of multiple judges \u2013 not all of whom would be stalwart conservatives. States may also lose on standing In the mifepristone case, the anti-abortion doctors who sued claimed that they faced the risk of being forced to treat patients dealing with complications from the drug, such as heavier-than-expected bleeding. Triaging those women, they said, had a substantial impact on their practices. Both the FDA and several medical groups, including the American Medical Association, told the Supreme Court that mifepristone is safe. Some said they had been called on to perform post-medication abortion procedures they said violated their beliefs. But the Supreme Court knocked that argument aside, noting that federal law already allows doctors to avoid performing procedures that violate their conscience. The states make a different argument on standing: That state-run hospitals and insurance programs have to pay the cost for adverse effects from the drug. Those kind of claims are heavily debated but even bank shot efforts by states to challenge federal action have sometimes found a receptive audience at the Supreme Court. Last term, a 6-3 majority shot down Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program. To do so, the court determined that Missouri could establish standing because a quasi-government loan servicing entity would lose out on an estimated $44 million in fees from loans that would have been forgiven under the plan. Adam Unikowsky, a veteran Supreme Court litigator who has closely followed the mifepristone case, predicted it will be hard for the states to get the issue back before the Supreme Court. Even if they can keep the current case going in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court \u2013 a tall order \u2013 states will have to convince lower courts that they were injured by the expanded access to mifepristone. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week doesn\u2019t explicitly foreclose that possibility, Unikowsky said, but it also did not make the path any easier. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving the door barely ajar for someone else to give it a shot,\u201d he said. But Unikowsky said he believes the states\u2019 claim \u201cis still weak on standing.\u201d Jaime Santos, co-chair of the appellate and Supreme Court litigation practice at the law firm Goodwin, predicted that the states are \u201cgoing to have a very hard time \u2013 and probably an impossible time\u201d continuing the case against the FDA\u2019s actions. If the states try to argue that they\u2019ll have to pay for women who wind up in the emergency room after taking mifepristone, she said, \u201cthat\u2019s just the kind of speculative injury that Justice Kavanaugh said isn\u2019t enough.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/abortion-judge-matthew-kacsmaryk-supreme-court-mifepristone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_us-designates-nordic-neo-nazi-group-terrorists", "text": "The US State Department on Friday designated a Nordic neo-Nazi group and three of its top officials as terrorists. It\u2019s the second time in history that the US has designated a foreign\u00a0White supremacist organization and its leaders as terrorists. The department designated the Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) and three of its top\u00a0officials\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Tor Fredrik Vejdeland, P\u00e4r \u00d6berg, and Leif Robert Eklund \u2013\u00a0as Specially Designated Global Terrorists on Friday, according to a statement from spokesperson Matthew Miller. It is the first time the Biden administration has made such a designation of a\u00a0White supremacist group. The Trump administration in 2020 designated the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) and its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. NRM is a transnational neo-Nazi organization founded in Sweden in 1997,\u00a0with branches in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland, according to the State Department. It was banned in Finland in 2020. According to a State Department fact sheet, NRM was designated \u201cfor having committed or attempted to commit, posing a significant risk of committing, or having participated in training to commit acts of terrorism that threaten the security of United States nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d The designation of NRM comes as US officials have warned that\u00a0White\u00a0supremacist terror groups continue\u00a0to pose a threat at home and abroad. The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community found that the \u201ctransnational racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists (RMVE) movement, in particular motivated by white supremacy, will continue to foment violence across Europe, South America, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand inspiring the lone actor or small-cell attacks that pose a significant threat to U.S. persons.\u201d \u201cNRM\u2019s violent activity is based on its openly racist, anti-immigrant, antisemitic, and anti-LGBTQI+ platform,\u201d Miller said Friday. \u201cThe group\u2019s members and leaders have carried out violent attacks against political opponents, protestors, journalists, and other perceived adversaries.\u201d \u201cNRM members have also taken steps to collect and prepare weapons and explosive materials, including on behalf of the group and in furtherance of its goals,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cIn addition, NRM has organized training in violent tactics, including hand-to-hand combat and knife fighting.\u201d The State Department said they were making the designations as \u201cpart of a broader U.S. government effort to address the transnational dimensions of the threat posed by REMVE actors and reflect the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s continued commitment to countering domestic terrorism (DT), which includes REMVE.\u201d In remarks Wednesday, a top State Department counterterrorism official warned that \u201ctransnational linkages\u201d were increasing, \u201cwith individuals and groups communicating both online and in-person, radicalizing individuals\u2014frequently young people\u2014to violence, recruiting, and sharing tactical training, including sharing instructions for making weapons.\u201d \u201cREMVE actors are becoming more and more adept at exploiting social media platforms, online gaming platforms and game-adjacent platforms, smaller websites with targeted audiences, and encrypted chat applications to recruit new followers, plan and rally ideological support, and disseminate materials that contribute to radicalization and mobilization to violence,\u201d said Ian Moss, the\u00a0deputy\u00a0coordinator for the Bureau of Counterterrorism. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order that gave the US government greater latitude to go after groups who train terrorists, not only groups that carry out terrorist attacks. Friday\u2019s designation will deny NRM members from accessing the US financial system, with the intention of making it more challenging for them to move money through the international system and fund their efforts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/us-designates-nordic-neo-nazi-group-terrorists/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_irs-wealthy-tax-cheats", "text": "The Internal Revenue Service announced Monday its latest move to crack down on wealthy tax cheats \u2013 an ongoing effort boosted by funding received through the Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act. The agency estimates the new initiative could result in the collection of $50 billion over 10 years by closing a major tax loophole used by some business partnerships to avoid paying taxes they owe. As the November election approaches, the Biden administration is eager to show how it\u2019s using money from the 2022 legislation \u2013 which provided the IRS with a massive, 10-year investment \u2013 to bring in more tax revenue and modernize taxpayer services. \u201cThanks to resources from President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, Treasury and the IRS have the tools to stop longstanding abuses,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a press release. Republicans are at odds with Democrats over the IRS funding. They\u2019ve criticized the additional money as wasteful spending and have made several\u00a0efforts to chip away at the agency\u2019s budget. The IRS initiative unveiled Monday, which consists of several pieces of regulatory guidance, targets abuse of what\u2019s known as \u201cbasis shifting transactions.\u201d Sometimes, complex business partnerships move money from one property to another in order to maximize tax deductions and minimize their tax liability. The IRS, in current and future audits, will be on the lookout for these kinds of transactions that have no substantial business purpose other than to reap a tax benefit. \u201cIn the audits we\u2019re doing today, we are seeing systemic use of basis shifting where there is no economic substance to the transaction. That is not allowed,\u201d said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel on a call with reporters Friday. \u201cThat allows them to inappropriately avoid taxes they owe, and this guidance today is intended to end that practice,\u201d he added. In recent decades, more American businesses have shifted away from organizing as a C corporation \u2013 which is subject to the corporate tax rate \u2013 and toward organizing as partnerships. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office said that the IRS should improve its efforts to audit the growing number of large, complex partnerships. Overhaul at the IRS Last month, the IRS detailed its plans to significantly ramp up audit rates of wealthy taxpayers and large corporations. Due to years of underfunding, IRS audit rates of multimillionaires and large corporations fell between 2010 and 2021. Overall staffing in the agency\u2019s compliance offices declined 30% during that time. To ramp up audits, the IRS is hiring the accountants, engineers, economists, data scientists, attorneys and tax experts\u00a0needed to conduct complex audits. Werfel has repeatedly said the agency is committed to shielding American households that earn less than $400,000 a year from an increase in audit rates. Specifically, audit rates of those Americans will not exceed what they were in 2018, a record-low year. The IRS is also using the funds from the Inflation Reduction Act to improve taxpayer services. As a result, the agency was able to answer 1 million more calls this year than it did during the previous tax season. Earlier this year, the IRS launched a pilot version of its own tax filing service that allowed Americans to file their returns for free directly with the IRS. More than 140,000 people used the program,\u00a0known as Direct File, to successfully file their tax returns this year. The agency has said it will continue and expand its\u00a0free tax filing program\u00a0in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/irs-wealthy-tax-cheats/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_biden-trump-tariffs-consumer-prices", "text": "In 2018, then-President Donald Trump put new tariffs on a variety of Chinese-made goods, including baseball caps, luggage and shoes \u2013 and Americans have been paying the price ever since. For example, a\u00a0suitcase that was $100 before Trump imposed the tariffs now goes for about $160,\u00a0and a carry-on that was $425 is now $700, said Tiffany Zarfas Williams,\u00a0who owns the Luggage Shop of Lubbock in Texas. As a small,\u00a0independent retailer, she had no choice but to raise prices on consumers to keep up with what she was charged by the brand name distributors, which paid the tariffs on the imported goods. \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge having to pass those kinds of price increases to the consumer,\u201d she said. Tariffs aren\u2019t the only reason prices went up over the last five years, but Zarfas Williams said she hoped President Joe Biden would lift the duties \u2013 which he previously criticized \u2013 to help alleviate some of the upward pressure on prices. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t get the basics,\u201d Biden said in a post on X in June 2019. \u201cHe thinks tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.\u201d But after a multi-year review of the duties was released last month, the Biden administration decided to keep them in place and raise the rate on a relatively small share of the impacted imports, including things like electrical vehicles and semiconductors made in China. Inflation, which soared earlier during the Biden administration, has cooled even with the tariffs still in place. But Biden\u2019s handling of the economy has dogged his approval ratings. Consumers\u2019 continued anxiety over high prices could be a political liability as he campaigns for reelection against Trump in November. While both candidates have embraced tariffs to protect US industries from China\u2019s unfair trade practices, Biden\u2019s strategy has hit far fewer goods than Trump\u2019s latest proposal to impose a tariff of at least 10% on all $3 trillion worth of US imports if he wins a second term. The tariffs Biden left in place \u2013 which are paid by US importers and not China \u2013 hit roughly $300 billion of goods. And he\u2019s planning to raise the rate on about $18 billion of those goods over the next two years. Supply chain problems that built up after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are also to blame for fueling inflation. But footwear and apparel trade groups say the tariffs on Chinese goods have certainly contributed to rising prices. How tariffs drive up consumer costs When Chinese-made shoes arrive at a US port, American importers like family-run shoe seller Deer Stags pay the tariff. Known for selling comfortable footwear to retailers like JCPenney, Kohl\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, Deer Stags has been importing most of its shoe line from China since the 1980s, said the company\u2019s president, Rick Muskat. Even though he\u2019d like to get a US supplier, a variety of factors \u2013 including earlier tariffs \u2013 helped shift most US shoe manufacturing offshore. In 2019, Trump\u2019s new tariffs added a 15% duty on about half of the footwear imports from China. He later lowered the rate to 7.5% in 2020, where it remains. Since the additional tariffs made the shoes more expensive for Deer Stags, Muskat had two choices: either eat the cost of the tariff, impacting his business\u2019s bottom line, or pass some of it along to the consumer. He decided to do a little bit of both. It was harder to get customers to pay more for existing styles that Deer Stags had carried for a long time, he said. So the company ended up eating the cost of the tariffs placed on some older styles and charging more for some new items. \u201cI developed a new style that never existed in our line before that\u2019s subject to the tariffs. So when we do our calculations and try to maintain our margins, those shoes ended up costing more than they would have had the tariff not been implemented,\u201d Muskat said. After Trump\u2019s tariffs hit, some US companies sought new manufacturers in other countries. As a result, China\u2019s share of total US footwear imports fell from 53% in 2018 to 40% in 2022, according to a report produced for apparel and footwear trade groups. But Muskat hasn\u2019t changed suppliers because he found moving production wasn\u2019t going to be cost effective. The Chinese are \u201cvery efficient at what they do. They can make a better product at a lower price, and the American consumer appreciates that,\u201d Muskat said. Phil Page, chairman of Missouri-based Cap America, also raised prices because of the tariffs. The company embroiders caps to sell to distributors of promotional products. Before the trade war began under Trump, Cap America imported most of its inventory directly from China. But once the tariffs hit, Page said, some Chinese manufacturers scrambled to move to other countries to avoid the US tariffs. Now, some of his imported caps are made in Vietnam and Bangladesh \u2013 but they aren\u2019t any cheaper than importing from China. Page said he\u2019s paying about the same, but the manufacturer is getting more money rather than the US government, which collects the tariff revenue. \u201cReally all the tariffs did was scatter the flock around and cost American consumers billions of dollars,\u201d Page said. Are tariffs to blame for inflation? Economists generally agree that tariffs drive up prices. JP Morgan economists estimated in 2019 that Trump\u2019s tariffs on about $300 billion of Chinese-made goods would cost the average American household $1,000 a year. But it\u2019s hard to determine just how much the tariffs \u2013 which didn\u2019t occur in a vacuum \u2013 ultimately contributed to the high inflation the US economy has experienced in recent years. More recently, housing prices are largely to blame for keeping inflation high. The Covid-19 pandemic upended the global economy roughly two years after Trump\u2019s trade war began. Several studies show that Trump\u2019s tariffs only marginally contributed to the rise in US inflation experienced after the pandemic and the following supply chain crisis. But when it comes to apparel, footwear and travel goods, industry trade groups say that the tariffs have undeniably helped to drive up prices on American consumers. The tariffs \u201cdefinitely contributed to the inflation we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Obviously there are other factors there, like the supply chain price. But we were a deflationary industry that turned when the China tariffs went into effect,\u201d said Nate Herman, senior vice president of policy at the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Until recently, average prices on apparel had been trending downward since the 1990s, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There\u2019s an \u201cunmistakable correlation\u201d between the tariffs and how much Americans are paying for shoes, said Matt Priest, president and CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. If Biden had lifted the tariffs, Priest believes shoe prices would eventually come down due to the highly competitive nature of the industry. Hypothetically, one company would inevitably lower their prices and then others would do the same to compete. In a letter sent to Biden in May, major shoe brands, including Adidas, Columbia Sportswear, Nike and Steve Madden, urged the administration to lift the tariffs. \u201cWe are confident that removing 301 tariffs will alleviate a costly burden in this key area and translate to savings for our shoppers,\u201d they wrote, referring to the section of the law Trump used to impose the tariffs. Biden announced he was keeping the duties in place four days after the letter was sent. The Biden administration has said the tariffs are one part of its overall strategy to strengthen US supply chains and protect American consumers and workers from China\u2019s unfair trading practices. China is known for subsidizing its own manufacturers, who then flood the global market with cheaper goods. \u201cThose tariffs have been in place in order to help, I think, balance out some of those dynamics that have been in place for a while,\u201d Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Wednesday when asked about why the tariffs were left in place. He noted how US inflation has come down to 3.3%. It had soared earlier during Biden\u2019s term, peaking in June 2022 at 9.1%. \u201cI think the important thing to recognize is that while those tariffs were in place, we had strong GDP growth, certainly avoided a recession that many people said was almost inevitable, we\u2019ve had unemployment below 4% for over two-and-a-half years,\u201d Bernstein said. Protecting US businesses from China Business leaders across the US, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, tend to agree that China\u2019s unfair trade policies, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers, need to be addressed. Trump\u2019s tariffs were meant to get China to address those issues. But the US Trade Representative\u2019s office recently said that while the tariffs have been \u201ceffective in encouraging\u201d China to \u201ctake steps\u201d toward ending some of its unfair trade practices, it \u201chas not eliminated many of its technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices.\u201d The textile industry, for example, is in favor of not only keeping the tariffs, but raising them. The National Council of Textile Organizations has pressed the Biden administration to increase the rate of the duties on textiles and apparel in order to protect domestic manufacturing from what it calls the \u201cflood of under-valued, subsidized and illegal imports from China.\u201d But leaders of the apparel and footwear industries say they didn\u2019t ask for the tariff protections. \u201cThere are issues with China in terms of intellectual property and a lot of counterfeit product comes out of China, but the tariff policy has done nothing \u2013 and we don\u2019t think will do anything \u2013 to address that issue,\u201d Herman said. While Trump did get Chinese President Xi Jinping to the negotiating table, some of the commitments China made in an agreement reached in January 2020 never came to fruition. Under what\u2019s known as the Phase One agreement, China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products \u2013 setting a target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began. But China fell well short of that pledge. A Phase Two agreement was never reached between the US and China under either the Trump or Biden administrations. Biden \u201chad a great opportunity to set a new policy and set a new direction, and all he\u2019s done is outsource his tariff policy to former President Trump,\u201d Herman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/biden-trump-tariffs-consumer-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_biden-hollywood-fundraiser", "text": "Joe Biden has raised $28 million heading into a star-studded fundraiser Saturday, campaign officials\u00a0told\u00a0CNN, as\u00a0the president\u00a0leans on his Hollywood friends to help boost his campaign war chest. The president\u2019s Los Angeles event with former President Barack Obama, George Clooney and Julia Roberts marks the campaign\u2019s latest effort to tap into celebrity appeal to help Biden win a second term in the White House. The LA fundraiser sets a new record for Democrats, raising more than an event at Radio City Music Hall in March that Biden campaign officials said brought in the party\u2019s biggest haul ever. The Biden campaign ran a contest geared toward small-dollar donors to win a chance to attend Saturday\u2019s\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0and meet Biden, Obama, Roberts and Clooney, who all sent emails or texts encouraging supporters to chip in. The campaign has also provided grassroots supporters at home an opportunity to tune into the event virtually with a donation of $20 or more. \u201cWhen you come up with an event like this, a concept like this,\u00a0you know it\u2019s going to be big. You know it\u2019s going to be exciting. You know it\u2019s going to gather a lot of attention. It\u2019s going to raise a lot of money,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, finance chair of the Biden campaign. \u201cThis one exceeded all of our expectations.\u201d It also comes as the campaign is trying to maintain its cash advantage over former President Donald Trump, who has made significant gains in his fundraising since securing the Republican nomination for president. The Trump campaign said it saw a huge boost in donations in the 24 hours after his conviction in the criminal hush money trial, bringing in $53 million. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel will moderate a conversation with Biden and Obama at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday.\u00a0Other celebrities, including Jason Bateman, Jack Black, Kathryn Hahn and Sheryl Lee Ralph, are also expected to participate in the evening\u2019s program, a campaign official said. Tickets for the Tinseltown event ranged from $250 to $500,000, with special access going to those purchasing tickets in the highest ranges, according to an invitation seen by CNN. Those donating $500,000 fall into the event chair category, which includes four tickets in the front row, a photograph with Biden and Obama, attendance at a special reception with the two presidents and tickets for the after party. The event is modeled after a high-dollar fundraiser featuring Biden, Obama, and former President Bill Clinton in New York City, which raked in more than $26 million. Biden is set to appear at a fundraiser with Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Virginia on Tuesday. In addition to drawing in a significant money haul, the Biden campaign is hoping Saturday\u2019s event will amount to a show of force from the entertainment industry. \u201cThis Saturday we are going to see an unprecedented and record setting turn out from the media and entertainment world,\u201d Jeffrey Katzenberg, a co-chair of the Biden campaign who played a major role in Saturday\u2019s fundraiser, said in a statement. \u201cThe enthusiasm and commitment for Biden/Harris couldn\u2019t be stronger. We all understand this is the most important election of our lifetime.\u201d Biden\u2019s advisers have already worked to tap into A-list star power to help push its campaign\u2019s message. Robert De Niro narrated an ad for the campaign, and the longtime Trump critic spoke at a news conference outside the former president\u2019s criminal trial in New York City last month. On Friday, Jane Fonda joined first lady Jill Biden for an event in Reno, Nevada, geared toward mobilizing senior voters. Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue, hosted a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in London this week and helped organize the three presidents fundraiser in New York City in March. Biden\u2019s advisers anticipate rolling out more endorsements and finding ways for celebrities to engage with the voters as Election Day nears. But many in Hollywood are wary of jumping into the political fray amid a hyper-divisive political landscape, sources have previously told CNN. The conflict in Gaza is among the issues that\u00a0have\u00a0divided Hollywood. The war loomed large over Biden\u2019s glitzy Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March with protesters outside and inside the venue. The Los Angeles fundraiser comes as Biden is looking to boost his campaign war chest amid signs Trump is narrowing the money gap. Biden has led Trump in fundraising for most of the year, but the former president has seen a significant influx in cash come his way since securing the Republican nomination in March. Trump outraised Biden for the first time in April. Trump\u2019s campaign and its affiliated committees announced they brought in $141 million in May, including $53 million in the 24 hours following his historic conviction in his criminal hush money trial. Trump\u2019s operation has yet to announce its cash-on-hand for the month. Biden has not unveiled his May fundraising haul, but his campaign and affiliated committees entered last month with $192 million cash-on-hand.

{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_chris-murphy-supreme-court-bump-stocks", "text": "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said Sunday the Supreme Court is \u201creadying\u00a0to fundamentally rewrite the Second Amendment\u201d after striking down a federal ban on bump stocks. Recent gun-related rulings from the high court, Murphy told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d signal it is prepared to \u201ctake away permanently the ability of Congress to do simple things like require people to go through a background check or move forward on taking dangerous weapons like AR-15s off of the streets.\u201d \u201cSo I think this court is poised to make it very hard for Congress or state legislatures to be able to regulate guns and keep our communities and schools safe,\u201d he said. The Supreme Court\u2019s striking down of the federal ban on bump stocks marked the latest opinion from the conservative bench rolling back firearm regulations. Former President Donald Trump had pushed for the ban in response to a\u00a02017 mass shooting that killed 58 people at an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas. But it was successfully challenged by a Texas gun store owner who purchased two of the devices in 2018 and turned them over to the government after the prohibition before suing to get them back. Bump stocks allow a shooter to convert a semi automatic rifle into a weapon that can fire hundreds of rounds a minute. \u201cThis is a Republican administration that banned bump stocks. At the time, Republicans in the Senate and the House were supportive of it,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said Sunday. \u201cBut now that they have got a Supreme Court that seems ready to unwind the entirety of the Second Amendment and take away from Congress or the executive branch the ability to keep our communities safe, they\u2019re once again lining up behind the gun industry.\u201d Murphy\u2019s comments echo the response of gun control advocacy groups, which argued Friday that the court\u2019s ruling will have a dangerous impact in a country constantly reeling from gun violence. The overwhelming majority of Republicans, however, celebrated the court\u2019s decision, arguing that they long believed the ban on bump stocks was unconstitutional. While the action was taken under the Trump administration, many Republicans argued it was the wrong move at the time. GOP Sen. Tom Cotton told Tapper in a separate interview Sunday that the bump stock ban \u201ctreads close\u201d to an infringement of the Second Amendment. \u201cI would suggest before we infringe on the rights of law-abiding American citizens, we should crack down on violent crime and gang crimes,\u201d\u00a0he said. Though the case didn\u2019t rely on the Second Amendment, it did put the debate about guns back on the court\u2019s docket in one of the most closely watched controversies this year. In that sense, the decision was the latest from the high court to side with gun rights groups. Still, Murphy \u2013 who has made gun safety legislation his life\u2019s work following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut \u2013 said \u201cthere is good news to celebrate today,\u201d pointing to dropping urban gun homicide rates. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do to make sure that something like Sandy Hook never happens again, that every kid gets the chance to graduate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have some reason to believe that this country is starting to turn the corner and change our laws in a way that makes our kids and our families safer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/chris-murphy-supreme-court-bump-stocks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

A senior administration official said Friday that the two men were likely to discuss the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and climate change. The pope, who is making history this week by becoming the first pontiff to attend a G7 gathering, also sat down with the group of world leaders to discuss, among other things, finding an ethical framework to underpin the development and use of AI, CNN previously reported. Deepfake images of the pope wearing a white puffer jacket went viral last year. The president is a lifelong practicing Catholic who met with the pope in 2021 in a visit to Italy. After that audience with the pope, Biden told reporters he discussed \u201ca lot of personal things\u201d with the pontiff and that the meeting was \u201cwonderful.\u201d The 2021 meeting with the pope came amid an effort by some Catholic bishops to deny Biden communion over his stance on abortion. In 2019, Biden was denied communion at a South Carolina church because of his support for abortion rights. But during that meeting, the pope assured Biden that he was a good Catholic and should continue receiving communion rites, Biden later told other leaders. \u201cWe just talked about the fact he was happy I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving communion,\u201d Biden said as he was greeting then-Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in Rome. At one point during that meeting, Biden presented the pope with a memento that carried deep personal significance: a coin that bore the insignia of the 261st Signal Brigade, the Delaware National Guard unit in which his late son Beau served as a captain. \u201cI know my son would want me to give it to you,\u201d Biden said. Per CNN\u2019s count, Friday will mark the fifth time Biden has met with this pope. The pope also visited the United States in the months following the president\u2019s son Beau\u2019s death in 2015 \u2013 and held a private meeting with Biden and his extended family in Pennsylvania.

He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said.

That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_steve-bannon-danbury-prison-contempt-of-congress", "text": "When\u00a0former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon\u00a0goes to prison, he won\u2019t be serving time at what\u2019s known as a \u201cClub Fed,\u201d the most comfortable type of facility in the federal system, as he had wanted,\u00a0according to people familiar with the arrangements. Instead of a minimum-security prison camp, where\u00a0many nonviolent offenders\u00a0serve their time,\u00a0Bannon \u2013 now a right-wing podcaster with a following of loyal Trump supporters \u2013 is set to report\u00a0next month\u00a0to the low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, one of the sources told CNN. A federal judge ruled recently\u00a0that\u00a0Bannon must turn himself in by July 1\u00a0to begin serving\u00a0a four-month\u00a0sentence\u00a0for contempt of Congress even as he appeals the case. His attorneys initially thought he may be able to do his time at a camp, the sources said. But\u00a0Bannon isn\u2019t eligible for the lowest-level prison setup because he still has a pending criminal case against him in New York,\u00a0where he is fighting the charges and set to go to trial in September. That case accuses him of defrauding donors in a fundraising effort branded the \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d\u00a0campaign for a border wall\u00a0between the US and Mexico. Bannon was convicted by a federal jury two years ago in Washington, DC, for not complying with\u00a0a\u00a0subpoena\u00a0for an\u00a0interview and documents in the US House\u2019s January 6, 2021, investigation. He has remained a staunch Trump ally and has been a vocal supporter of his presidential reelection bid. Bannon\u2019s lawyers have\u00a0written to the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals that his imprisonment shouldn\u2019t happen this summer, as the trial-level judge has ordered, because he would be behind bars \u201cfor the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,\u201d according to a recent filing for Bannon. \u201cThis would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign,\u201d Bannon\u2019s lawyers wrote. The\u00a0Federal\u00a0Bureau of Prisons declined to comment, saying it could not release specific information on prisoners until after they\u2019re in custody, for security and privacy reasons. The prison in Connecticut where Bannon will live houses a large number of white-collar criminals, but it also\u00a0may house\u00a0violent\u00a0and sex\u00a0offenders in its men\u2019s population. It doesn\u2019t have cells, and instead houses its inmates in open pods. Yet it does have a noticeable barrier\u00a0\u2014\u00a0referred to colloquially as \u201cthe wall\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0between\u00a0the prison\u00a0facility\u00a0and the outside world, which prison camps don\u2019t have. More than 1,000 male prisoners are in the Danbury facility. Its\u00a0much smaller\u00a0adjacent prison camp for women was immortalized in\u00a0a former\u00a0prisoner\u2019s memoir that inspired the TV show \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d Some of Bannon\u2019s defense attorneys, when contacted by CNN on Monday, weren\u2019t aware of the plans or available, and Bannon hasn\u2019t commented directly. Rikers Island possibility Bannon could\u00a0still\u00a0potentially\u00a0face rougher prison environments. He may need to be held in a facility in New York City, such as the infamous Rikers Island jail, during his state trial proceedings if it takes place while he is still serving his federal sentence, one of the sources said. His time in\u00a0federal\u00a0prison is likely to run through October if no appeals court intervenes, the person said. Bannon\u00a0and Peter Navarro\u00a0\u2013\u00a0another Trump adviser who was sent to prison for contempt of Congress in the\u00a0January 6 investigation \u2013\u00a0are not able to be released earlier than their four-month terms in prison, as some first-time offenders can be, because their sentences don\u2019t include time under supervised release, people familiar with\u00a0their\u00a0situations tell CNN. Navarro is set to be released on July 17.\u00a0This means both Navarro and Bannon will be behind bars during the Republican National Convention in mid-July. Both men retained prison consultant Sam Mangel to help them have the best setup on the inside. Bannon is awaiting word from the DC Circuit\u00a0this week\u00a0on whether a panel of three judges would be willing to keep him out of prison for the moment.\u00a0He has already lost one round of appeals, but his lawyers say he intends to go to the Supreme Court. Bannon and Trump Bannon still maintains close connections\u00a0to Trump and his\u00a0political world\u200b. Bannon\u00a0spoke at a conservative gathering in Detroit this weekend where Trump also spoke. Bannon vowed\u00a0that Trump\u2019s political opponents and federal law enforcement authorities\u00a0would face blowback\u00a0if Trump wins a second term as president. \u201cYou are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d Bannon said. And Boris Epshteyn, one of the most influential legal advisers around Trump currently,\u00a0has\u00a0been part of Bannon\u2019s legal defense strategy, according to multiple sources familiar with the\u00a0matter. On Monday,\u00a0Bannon said\u00a0the former\u00a0president\u00a0was calling him during\u00a0his podcast. Bannon\u00a0answered the phone and said\u00a0he would call\u00a0Trump\u00a0back.

{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_trump-black-voters-detroit", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on Saturday launched a coalition group targeting Black voters as the former president campaigned in Detroit in an effort to win over a segment of the electorate that has long overwhelmingly backed Democrats. Trump held a community roundtable at the predominantly Black 180 Church in Detroit, where he was joined by two Black Republicans \u2014 Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson \u2014 who were part of the launch of the \u201cBlack Americans for Trump\u201d group. Donalds and Carson are among several candidates said to be under consideration to be Trump\u2019s running mate. The former president praised Donalds on Saturday as an \u201cincredible guy.\u201d \u201cI noticed he happened to be on the list of potential vice presidents. Would anybody like to see him as vice president?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. He later added that he thinks Donalds would be \u201ca good one, too.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s on a list, by the way. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to make it. But he\u2019s on a list of a few people, right? Not too many people,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s attempts to court Black voters come as polls show that Black men are more open to supporting the Republican nominee in this year\u2019s election than they have historically been. A\u00a0New York Times/Siena College survey\u00a0of battleground states released last month found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden, which would amount to a historic high if it translates to votes in November. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in\u00a0CNN\u2019s exit poll. While President Joe Biden is likely to win Black voters by a large margin, the siphoning away of even a modicum of support by Trump could tilt the outcome in several battleground states \u2013 including Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Trump has long criticized cities with sizable Black populations. In 2019, he referred to a predominantly Black congressional district in Baltimore as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d In a closed-door meeting with House Republicans this week in Washington, he reportedly described Milwaukee \u2014 where the GOP will hold its convention in August \u2014 as \u201chorrible.\u201d (The Trump campaign said the former president \u201cwas talking about how terrible crime and voter fraud are\u201d in Wisconsin\u2019s largest city.) In 2016, Trump said Democrats had long failed Black voters and asked for their votes, famously saying: \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Trump has pushed back on accusations of racism, telling Semafor in a recent interview that he has \u201cso many Black friends\u201d who would not support him if they believed he was racist \u2014 a comment the Biden campaign highlighted Saturday in its response to Trump\u2019s Black coalition launch. \u201cDonald Trump thinks the fact that he has \u2018many Black friends\u2019 excuses an entire lifetime of denigrating and disrespecting Black Americans, but Black voters know better \u2013 and Trump\u2019s eleventh hour attempt at Black \u2018outreach\u2019 isn\u2019t fooling anyone,\u201d Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign\u2019s director of Black media, said in a statement. Trump on Saturday also cited Biden\u2019s role as a US senator in crafting the 1994 crime bill, falsely accusing his opponent of making the same remark Trump once chided Hillary Clinton for making. \u201cBiden wrote the devastating 1994 crime bill, talking about \u2018super predators.\u2019 That was Biden. You know, he walks around now talking about the Black vote. He\u2019s the king of the \u2018super predators,\u2019\u201d Trump said during the roundtable discussion. As CNN has previously noted, Biden did not publicly deploy or endorse the phrase \u201csuper predators.\u201d Biden did warn in a 1993\u00a0speech of \u201cpredators on our streets\u201d who were \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d in support of the crime bill. But he used the phrase \u201csuper predators\u201d only to reject the theory \u2013 arguing in a 1997 speech that the vast majority of youth involved with the criminal justice system were not violent and \u201cnot the so-called super predators.\u201d Trump wrote in a 2000 book that he supported tougher sentencing and street policing and warned of \u201cwolf packs\u201d of young criminals roaming the streets \u2013 and he cited a since-discredited statistical analysis that was linked to the \u201csuper predator\u201d crime theory. As he has before, Trump claimed Saturday that he\u2019s done \u201cmore for the Black population than any American president since Abraham Lincoln,\u201d while arguing that Biden had done \u201cnothing\u201d for the Black community and was \u201call talk.\u201d Trump later spoke at a convention hosted by Turning Point Action in Detroit. Before the former president took the stage at the conservative gathering, Carson touted his onetime boss\u2019s ability to engage with Black communities. \u201cPresident Trump is not your typical politician,\u201d Carson said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t run around with his finger in the air seeing which way the wind is blowing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-black-voters-detroit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is making a concerted effort to win over Black voters \u2013 in part by making inaccurate claims. During a Saturday\u00a0roundtable discussion\u00a0at a predominately Black church in Detroit, Trump said President Joe Biden \u201chas done nothing for you except talk,\u201d\u00a0adding: \u201cWe achieved the lowest African American unemployment rate and the lowest African American poverty rate ever recorded \u2013 ever, ever recorded \u2013 during my four years.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims about having achieved the lowest Black unemployment rate and poverty rate ever recorded were true\u00a0when he made them\u00a0before Biden took office, but they are not true today. Both of the record lows set during Trump\u2019s presidency were surpassed by new record lows during Biden\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 Trump could have correctly said Saturday that, during\u00a0his presidency, Black unemployment and Black poverty hit their lowest levels ever recorded\u00a0as of that point. Instead, he deceptively portrayed records that have been bested under Biden as supposed evidence that he has done more for the Black community than Biden has. Let\u2019s look at the data. Black unemployment: Record low set in 2023 under Biden The record low for the Black or African American unemployment rate, 4.8%, was\u00a0set under Biden in April 2023. That beat the Trump-era low that was a record at the time, 5.3% in August 2019 and September 2019. (A cautionary note: This official data series goes back only to 1972.) The most recent Black or African American unemployment rate, for May 2024, is 6.1%. Though that is a clear uptick from the 2023 record, it is\u00a0low by historical standards. And it is the same as the rate under Trump in February 2020, just before the Covid-19 pandemic caused unemployment to skyrocket. In the month Biden took over from Trump, January 2021, the Black or African American unemployment rate was 9.3%. The early pandemic jump is a good example of how unemployment rates, like all economic figures, are affected by factors other than who the president is. Black poverty: Record low set in 2022 under Biden The record low in the official poverty rate for Black individuals, 17.1%, was\u00a0set under Biden in 2022, the most recent year for which the data is available. Under Trump, the\u00a0lowest official poverty rate for Black individuals\u00a0was a then-record\u00a018.8% in 2019. There are\u00a0different ways to measure poverty. The Biden era also\u00a0holds the record low, 11.3%, for Black individual poverty under the\u00a0Supplemental Poverty Measure, which incorporates cash and noncash government benefits, tax credits, people\u2019s necessary expenses and geographic differences in the cost of living. The\u00a0lowest\u00a0supplemental figure for Black individual poverty under Trump was 14.7% in 2020. The supplemental figure for Black individual poverty spiked to 17.2% in 2022 after the\u00a0expiry\u00a0of pandemic relief\u00a0initiatives\u00a0that had lowered the figure in 2020 and 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-black-unemployment-poverty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_biden-undocumented-spouses", "text": "President Joe Biden is preparing to announce sweeping executive action Tuesday that would shield select undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation and allow them to work legally in the country as they seek citizenship, according to people familiar with the plans. The policy would apply to people who have been living in the United States for 10 years, and would utilize an existing legal authority known as \u201cparole in place\u201d that offers deportation protections. The election-year efforts have been long sought by immigration advocates and Democrats, and come after Biden earlier this month took restrictive steps to limit asylum processing at the US southern border. The moves, which CNN first reported last week, could amount to the federal government\u2019s biggest relief program since the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work in the country, was announced\u00a0in mid-June of Obama\u2019s own reelection year in 2012. Biden plans to hold an event marking the anniversary of DACA on Tuesday, according to his weekly schedule. The steps he is preparing to unveil also include a pathway to work visas for DACA recipients who meet certain criteria, a person familiar with the plans said. Hundreds of thousands of people could be affected by the moves,\u00a0with a reverberating effect among spouses, children, extended family and friends \u2013 and predominantly Latinos. Biden previewed the new steps while unveiling the new asylum rules earlier in June. \u201cIn the weeks ahead \u2013 and I mean the weeks ahead \u2013 I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just,\u201d he said. Polling reviewed by top aides in the White House and the president\u2019s reelection headquarters\u00a0helped the administration finalize the plan.

Biden meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Italy on the sidelines of the G7 summit Thursday, aiming to personally reinforce a promise he spelled out last week on Normandy battlefields where fascism began to crack 80 years ago. \u201cWe will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,\u201d Biden said surrounded by the last surviving US veterans of D-Day and the graves of more than 9,000 of their fallen comrades. \u201cUkraine\u2019s neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened. \u2026\u00a0The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president\u2019s term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe\u2019s security. And the \u201cautocrats of the world\u201d name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House. Biden\u2019s emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy. But uncertainty over the West\u2019s long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It\u2019s fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky. In the United States, Trump \u2013 who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe\u2019s security given his endless attacks on NATO \u2013 may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend \u2013 especially in powerhouses France and Germany \u2013 could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin\u2019s willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does. But a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine\u2019s Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America\u2019s fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November. A flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine Still, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent. \u2014Biden\u2019s return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House\u2019s priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries. \u2014As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin\u2019s war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. \u201cRussia today has become a war economy,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. \u201cEvery day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.\u201d \u2014Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine\u2019s armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. \u201cWe want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we\u2019ll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power. \u2014US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit \u2013 which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada \u2013 will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets. \u2014These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky\u2019s elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance. Russian advances on the battlefield These are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured. The latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites \u201ca worrisome trend\u201d of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. Relentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv\u2019s electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon. Russian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe\u2019s territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war. \u201cThe Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,\u201d Clark said. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Technically, they\u2019re pretty smart. They\u2019ve got China behind them; they\u2019ve got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later. An inspiring war turns into a bitter slog An extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes. At times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky\u2019s interactions with the West. The Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package \u2013 a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up. Biden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan. Not surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden\u2019s core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president\u2019s critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil. John Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to \u201ctake bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom.\u201d But there\u2019s a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/joe-biden-ukraine-g7-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-jobs-biden-immigration", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, who has promised to conduct mass deportations if he is elected to a second term in November, continued his angry rhetoric about illegal immigration at a campaign rally in Nevada in early June. \u201cVirtually 100% of the new jobs under Biden have also gone to illegal aliens,\u201d Trump said. Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim\u00a0that nearly all the new jobs under Biden have gone to immigrants, whether or not they are allowed to legally work in the US\u00a0is false. The number of US-born workers increased about 3.5% between May 2021, just after Biden took office, and last month, though it did decline 0.2% over the past year,\u00a0according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\u00a0 It\u2019s true that the number of foreign-born workers has increased at a much faster rate \u2013 20% \u2013 than the rate for native-born workers during Biden\u2019s presidency, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the native-born are not getting jobs. Also, many economists credit the influx of immigrant workers as a main reason the US labor market has remained strong, and the unemployment rates for both\u00a0immigrants and US-born workers remain low by historical standards. First, two caveats: We don\u2019t know how Trump is defining illegal aliens, specifically whether he\u2019s including people who may have entered the country illegally but now have work permits. The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on foreign-born workers, which it defines as people who were born outside the US and neither of whose parents was a US citizen. The category covers legally-admitted immigrants including those who have become naturalized citizens, undocumented immigrants, refugees and temporary residents such as students and temporary workers, but the data doesn\u2019t specify the groups into which people fall. Getting back to the claim: One of the major themes of Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns has been that undocumented immigrants are destroying America. Here\u2019s what the Bureau of Labor Statistics data show: Some 130.4 million native-born people were employed in May. That\u2019s an increase of nearly 4.5 million since May 2021, shortly after Biden took office, though it\u2019s down nearly 300,000 from May 2023. (The data is not seasonally adjusted, so we must look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, about 123 million native-born people were employed.) Roughly 30.9 million foreign-born people held jobs in May, up 5.1 million from May 2021 and 637,000 since May 2023. (In January 2021, 25.3 million of the foreign-born were employed.) There is no comprehensive data on how many immigrants without work permits are employed, but economists at Standard Chartered Bank in May looked into what share of the recent job growth went to immigrants such as asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees and refugees who received authorization to work legally in the US. While none of these groups are working illegally in the US, as Trump referenced in his speech, the analysis provides useful insight into how many jobs these immigrants may have landed in recent years. Standard Chartered estimated that about half the jobs added in fiscal year 2024, which began October 1, went to these immigrants. On average, more than 170,000 of these immigrants a month received initial employment authorization documents from US Citizenship and Immigration Services in the current fiscal year, according to Standard Chartered\u2019s analysis. On average, about 64% of the foreign-born population are working, so that would translate into about 109,000 asylum seekers, humanitarian parolees and refugees finding jobs each month. The economy has added about 230,000 jobs a month this fiscal year, so these immigrant workers would account for just under half of that growth, according to the analysis, which was conducted by Steve Englander, head of North American Macro Strategy, and Dan Pan, economist, at Standard Chartered Bank. In fiscal year 2023, these immigrants likely held more than 800,000 of the 3.1 million jobs added, or more than 25%, the analysis estimated. Recent surges of immigration account for the increase in the share of immigrant workers\u00a0in the current fiscal year, the analysts said. The analysts note that they could be underestimating the number of such immigrants that landed jobs because they are often \u201cheavily motivated\u201d to work since they have limited access to public benefits. Trump could have fairly said, as some right-leaning commentators have suggested, that the number of native-born workers has declined in the past year, while the number of foreign-born workers has increased. But that\u2019s not true when looking over Biden\u2019s entire term in office. Moreover, some economists say it\u2019s better to look at the share of people working, rather than the number, because the former takes into account population and demographic changes, such as Baby Boomers aging out of the labor force. Some 59.3% of the native born were working last month, compared to 57.7% in May 2021, and some 64% of the foreign born had jobs last month, compared to 60.2% in May 2021. The economy was still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic shock early in Biden\u2019s term. Both groups had even lower rates of employment in January 2021. Still, the share of employed foreign-born men has been higher than the share of working native-born men since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started keeping track in 2007. Overall, the share of men who are working has been declining for decades \u2013 a trend that has puzzled labor economists and led to many theories as to the causes, such as the decline in factory jobs, increases in technology and globalization and the rise in the number of men with criminal convictions. All these can make it more difficult for men, particularly those with fewer skills or less education, to find work. \u201cForeign-born men come to this country, and they want to work,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen declining labor force participation rates among native-born men for decades.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-jobs-biden-immigration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_biden-campaign-trump-ad", "text": "The Biden campaign is rolling out a new ad in battleground states framing the election as a choice between a \u201cconvicted criminal\u201d and a president \u201cfighting for your family\u201d in its latest effort to seize on Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in his criminal hush money trial in its appeal to voters. It marks the first time President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has used Trump\u2019s legal woes in its television advertising campaigns, setting up a major contrast push as the two prepare to face off in their first debate, which will be hosted by CNN on June 27.\u00a0The campaign spot, titled \u201cCharacter Matters,\u201d is part of a $50 million ad buy in June and will run on television and internet-connected TV in battleground states and on national cable, the campaign announced Monday. The 30-second spot opens with black-and-white images of Trump walking into the Manhattan courthouse where he was recently found guilty of falsifying business records, before pivoting to draw a contrast with what the campaign says Biden\u2019s administration has accomplished. \u201cIn the courtroom we see Donald Trump for who he is. He\u2019s been convicted of 34 felonies, found liable for sexual assault, and he committed financial fraud,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cMeanwhile, Joe Biden\u2019s been working, lowering health care costs and making big corporations pay their fair share.\u201d \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself,\u201d the narrator says as the former president\u2019s mug shot splashes across the screen. \u201cAnd a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign responded to the ad by repeating its claim that the hush money trial amounted to \u201celection interference\u201d and pointed to recent polling that indicates Biden\u2019s message is struggling to break through in key battlegrounds. \u201cThe contrast between President Trump\u2019s strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement posted on X. For months, Biden and his team refrained from using Trump\u2019s legal woes in their arguments against him. But that changed in the days after Trump was found guilty in New York. The campaign has leaned into using the verdict as further evidence the former president is unfit for office and has branded him a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d in statements. Biden first addressed Trump\u2019s conviction one day after the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict, saying in remarks at the White House that it reaffirmed \u201cthe American principle that no one is above the law.\u201d Three days later, the president used the term \u201cconvicted felon\u201d to describe his opponent at a Connecticut fundraiser. \u201cFor the first time in American history, a former president is convicted \u2013 a convicted felon.\u00a0He\u2019s now seeking the office of the presidency,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut as disturbing as that is, more demanding, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\u201d At a Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles over the weekend, former President Barack Obama lamented the normalization of \u201cbehavior that used to be disqualifying,\u201d referencing Trump\u2019s conviction. It\u2019s unclear how much of an impact Trump\u2019s conviction will have on the 2024 race. The former president\u2019s campaign said it saw an influx of online donations in the 24 hours after the guilty verdict was announced, bringing in $53 million. The ad push comes 10 days before Biden and Trump will appear on the debate stage at a CNN studio in Atlanta for the first in-person showdown of the 2024 campaign. \u201cTrump approaches the first debate as a convicted felon who continues to prove that he will do anything and harm anyone if it means more power and vengeance for Donald Trump,\u201d the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, Michael Tyler, said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/biden-campaign-trump-ad/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_felons-inmates-voting-what-matters", "text": "Both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, face sentencing for nonviolent felonies before Election Day. Although it seems unlikely either will be behind bars on November 5, it\u2019s worth noting that how and whether felons and people otherwise detained can cast election ballots has developed into a major civil rights issue in recent years. The rules for how felons, inmates and those facing trial can cast ballots vary from state to state, and a number of recently enacted laws and ballot initiatives will change things further in 2024. In California, where Hunter Biden lives, for instance, only people who are serving time in prison are ineligible to vote, according to a database maintained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In Delaware, where he was convicted in federal court, there are more restrictions on felons voting. In Florida, where Trump lives, there are more restrictions on felons voting than in New York, where Trump was convicted in state court. There are only a few places \u2013 Vermont, Maine and the District of Colombia \u2013 where everyone can vote, even if they\u2019re convicted felons serving time in prison. Everywhere else in the US places prohibitions on incarcerated felons, and some states include other prohibitions. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Kimberly Berryman traveled to Nevada, where Tuesday was primary day and, for the first time, people who are detained, for a variety of reasons, were able to vote despite their incarceration. They met inmates casting ballots for the first time in their lives. Watch their full report. Nevada\u2019s state government gave felons who\u00a0have been released from prison the ability to vote back in 2019. That still left a population of people who are not convicted of a felony but are detained in jail in the lurch. A new law passed this year in Nevada required jails to facilitate access to voting for those non-felons inside jails in the state. Tuesday\u2019s primary was the first test. \u201cTheir vote should not be any less important than the individuals that are out here,\u201d Sadmira Ramic, a voting rights staff attorney for the ACLU of Nevada, told Murray and Berryman. \u201cThey face those barriers that we here on the outside don\u2019t even really think about.\u201d One major issue is confusion. Unfounded allegations of illegitimate and illegal votes or outright rigged elections have caused confusion among inmates about where they stand, so they often don\u2019t vote at all. For instance, despite Florida voters overwhelmingly agreeing in 2018 to reenfranchise felons in that state, a series of actions by the legislature complicated voting for felons, leading to court battles and confusion. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, made a show of trying to prosecute people for illegally voting in 2022. The ACLU has worked with voting rights groups in Nevada to make sure detained people who have the right to vote can access that right this year, but at one point threatened a lawsuit in order to make sure access to polling booths was granted by primary day. In a presidential election that could be decided by a small fraction of votes in key states like Nevada, even a small number of additional votes could, in theory, change the outcome. Nevada is also the site of a hotly contested Senate race that could determine which party controls the Senate next year. Jagada Chambers, a former inmate who is now a rights restoration coordinator for Silver State Voices, a voting rights group, told Murray and Berryman she hopes politicians will see the potential of asking for the votes of people who are detained. \u201cIn Clark County, you have potential victories lying in those cells,\u201d Chambers said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/felons-inmates-voting-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked at a press conference in Italy last week about whether China was selling Russia arms for use in the war. Biden, who was standing beside him, waited for Zelensky to say President Xi Jinping told him he would not do so, before delivering a parting shot and ending the event. \u201cBy the way, China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it.\u00a0So, it is, in fact, helping Russia.\u201d The comment appeared to signal a hardening tone toward Beijing following months of US warnings that it shouldn\u2019t help its friends in Moscow over the war. NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg reinforced the tough new line during a visit to Washington Monday that included Oval Office talks with Biden. \u201cPublicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he\u2019s taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China\u2019s fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\u201d Stoltenberg said at The Wilson Center. \u201cAt the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\u201d Concerns that America\u2019s enemies are aiding Russia\u2019s war effort are sure to grow with the impending trip by Putin to North Korea, which the Kremlin said would have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d list of events, including with the isolated Stalinist state\u2019s tyrannical leader Kim Jong Un. The idea of an anti-US front among Russia, China, North Korea and Iran has long preoccupied foreign policy experts in Washington. Up until recently, US intelligence agencies have assessed that differences between the uneasy partners make formal alliances unlikely. But all those powers have one big thing in common: a desire to thwart American goals and power. Each is also subject to a brutal autocratic regime that is threatened by the democracy that unites the US and its European and Asian allies. The announcement that Putin is headed to Pyongyang raised the state of alert in Washington. In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress that Russia\u2019s need to replenish its military supplies had forced it to grant \u201clong-sought concessions\u201d to North Korea. She did not specify the extent of the cooperation, but her comment sparked speculation that Moscow was offering nuclear or missile expertise. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell added to the intrigue last week when he said at a Stimson Center event that the North Koreans have embarked on a series of \u201cprovocative\u201d actions including by supplying Russia with artillery and missiles. And he added: \u201cWe have a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia and they have had a substantial impact on the battlefield.\u201d But the US doesn\u2019t seem to know what Kim will get in return. \u201cWhat is Russia going to provide in exchange to North Korea,\u00a0hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know but we are concerned by that and are watching carefully.\u201d He added: \u201cThe entire scope of the Russia/North Korea relationship is something we follow carefully and are concerned about.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/us-alarm-china-north-korea-russia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_election-age-what-matters", "text": "A truism of American politics is that older voters prefer the Republican and younger voters prefer the Democrat. That\u2019s what happened in 2020, when Democrat Joe Biden won voters under 50 and Republican Donald Trump won voters over 50, according to exit polls. Biden\u2019s margin among younger voters \u2014 he got 65% of voters ages 18-24 \u2014 helped him overcome the fact that Trump got 52% of older voters, who accounted for more than half the electorate. In 2016, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College even though she got more votes than him, but the pattern of younger voters supporting the Democrat held. Clinton got more votes among voters ages 18-44, and Trump got more votes among voters ages 45 and older, according to exit polls. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney lost the election, but he did better than Democrat Barack Obama among voters 45 and older. Voters under 30 haven\u2019t preferred the Republican since 1988, when George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in a landslide. Voters over the age of 65 haven\u2019t preferred the Democrat since 2000, when Al Gore lost the election despite getting more votes than Republican George W. Bush. But the old rules don\u2019t seem to apply in this year\u2019s presidential election, where both candidates are old men and their fitness to serve is a top issue. Older voters are gravitating to Biden, and younger voters are taking a look at Trump. A new Marist poll in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, for instance, showed a tight race overall with Trump at 47% and Biden at 45%, a within-the-margin-of-error difference. Trump is making inroads with voters of color and is nearly even with Biden among voters under 45 in that poll. But older voters have gone in the opposite direction, and instead of favoring Trump, are nearly split in the Marist poll. It\u2019s a trend that extends to other states. In a nationwide Quinnipiac University poll released in May, Biden and Trump split younger voters, but Biden has an edge among voters 65 and older. Not\u00a0every poll shows the same\u00a0level of shift,\u00a0but\u00a0the general movement among both younger and older voters is\u00a0a departure from past results. Biden is now leaning into questions about his age that have dogged his reelection campaign and worry voters in opinion polls. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it,\u201d first lady Jill Biden said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin this week, part of a three-day swing designed to boost his support among older voters. Older voters are essentially Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s peers. Both men were born in the 1940s. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Eric Bradner note that older voters were \u201calive in the aftermath of World War II and the Cold War, a period Biden has attempted to tap into as he casts Trump as a threat to democracy.\u201d They also write that \u201cin 2024, baby boomers now make up a wide majority of the senior vote for the first time \u2014 an enticing demographic shift the Biden campaign is seizing upon in Michigan and across the country.\u201d In Michigan, Zeleny and Bradner talked to Linda Van Werden, a retired real estate agent who only got active in politics after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be one of those people holding up a political sign or being involved, but I can\u2019t sit back anymore and watch this happen,\u201d she said. Despite the shift of older voters in the direction of Biden (and younger voters away from him), I was surprised to see older voters still have reservations about Biden\u2019s age. In a February New York Times/Siena College poll, nearly three-quarters of registered voters ages 65 and older said Biden was too old to be effective as president compared with less than half who said the same about Trump. Those figures tracked with the population at large. CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein noted last year that older voters were more likely to approve of Biden\u2019s job performance and argued that some of his policy wins, like pushing for lowering drug costs in Medicare, appeal directly to seniors. Whatever the reason, if Biden is to overcome questions about his age to keep his job, it will be with help from people his own age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/election-age-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_nato-allies-spending", "text": "The United States and NATO are expected to announce Monday that the number of allied countries spending at least 2% of their country\u2019s economic output on defense has doubled during President Joe Biden\u2019s term. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is visiting Washington and meeting with Biden ahead of the city\u2019s hosting of the alliance\u2019s annual summit, set to take place in July. \u201cJust five years ago, there was still less than 10 allies that spent 2% of GDP on defense,\u201d Stoltenberg said during remarks at The Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cI can only now reveal that this year, more than 20 allies will spend at least 2% of GDP on defense.\u201d \u201cThis is good for Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd good for America.\u201d It was not immediately clear which countries are not yet meeting the defense-spending benchmarks. But the number of countries that are meeting those goals has steadily increased since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Several NATO member countries that either border Russia or are nearby have hiked their defense spending since 2022. At a 2014 summit in Wales, NATO members reaffirmed a commitment to spend a minimum of 2% of their country\u2019s GDP on defense, a pledge with renewed urgency after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. But only a fraction of the countries met that goal, leading to criticism from former President Donald Trump that the US shoulders too much of the cost of defending Europe. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying, \u2018Look \u2013 if they\u2019re not going to pay, we\u2019re not going to protect,\u2019\u201d Trump told a rally audience in February. For countries that don\u2019t meet those obligations, Trump offered a suggestion that shocked world leaders and key US allies \u2013 and raised questions about how the United States would interact on the world stage under a potential new Trump presidency. The former president said he would let Russia do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to such countries, and implied he would not abide by the collective-defense clause at the heart of the NATO alliance if elected. Biden has heralded NATO as the \u201cgreatest defense alliance in the history of the world,\u201d and the alliance has expanded by two member countries since he became president. Finland joined NATO last year, while Sweden joined in March. Ukraine has aspirations to join the alliance, but Biden said its war with Russia would need to end before NATO could consider the country\u2019s membership. While US officials tell CNN the White House and NATO leadership have held frequent discussions on the need to increase spending across the alliance, the timing of this week\u2019s announcement would undercut a frequent attack line by Trump ahead of next week\u2019s presidential debate hosted by CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_merrick-garland-contempt-vote-no-prosecution", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday he will move\u00a0in federal court\u00a0to enforce a subpoena\u00a0against Attorney General Merrick Garland to obtain\u00a0audio recordings of President Joe Biden, after the Justice Department declined to act on\u00a0the House\u2019s\u00a0contempt referral. Johnson said in a statement that he disagrees with the DOJ\u2019s decision, calling it \u201canother example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration.\u201d \u201cI will be certifying the contempt reports to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe will also move to enforce the subpoena of Attorney General Garland in federal court.\u201d In a letter to Johnson earlier Friday, DOJ pointed to its \u201clongstanding\u201d position of not prosecuting executive branch officials who withhold information subject to executive privilege from Congress. The announcement was anticipated after the House, in a mostly party-line vote, held Garland in contempt for not turning over audio from Biden\u2019s interview in special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s classified documents investigation. \u201cConsistent\u00a0with this\u00a0longstanding\u00a0position and uniform practice,\u00a0the\u00a0Department has determined\u00a0that\u00a0the responses by Attorney General Garland to\u00a0the subpoenas\u00a0issued\u00a0by\u00a0the Committees\u00a0did not\u00a0constitute\u00a0a\u00a0crime,\u00a0and\u00a0accordingly the\u00a0Department will not bring\u00a0the congressional\u00a0contempt\u00a0citation before\u00a0a\u00a0grand\u00a0jury or take\u00a0any other action to\u00a0prosecute the Attorney General,\u201d the letter, from the department\u2019s top congressional liaison, said. Republican lawmakers have argued that access to the tapes would provide more information, transparency and oversight around the investigation into a sitting US president. On Wednesday, every Republican in the House except one \u2013 Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio \u2013 voted to hold Garland in contempt of Congress. While the Justice Department has defended its decision to not turn over the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews with Hur and his team \u2013 claiming the decision was made in part to protect this and future investigations \u2013 the Justice Department did make public transcripts of those interviews. In describing the interviews, Hur said that Biden presented himself \u201cas a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d At the time, Biden ridiculed Hur\u2019s report and questions about his memory. \u201cTheir task was to make a decision over whether to move forward with charges in this case,\u201d Biden said during a press conference following the report, noting that Hur did not move forward with charges. \u201cFor any extraneous commentary they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. It has not place in this report.\u201d CNN has\u00a0sued for access to the audio recordings, writing in the April lawsuit that \u201cwithout access to any of the interview records, the press and public initially could not form their own conclusions about Hur\u2019s characterization of Biden. \u2026 Transcripts, however, are no substitute for recordings.\u201d In a statement following the vote to hold him in contempt, Garland said Republicans had turned \u201ca serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon\u201d and that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_us-temporarily-dismantle-gaza-pier", "text": "The US military will temporarily dismantle the\u00a0humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza\u00a0and move it back to Israel on Friday night, amid concerns that heavy seas could once again break\u00a0it just days after it resumed aid delivery operations, multiple\u00a0US\u00a0officials and US Central Command said. It will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the\u00a0Shore,\u00a0or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of Ashdod.\u00a0It is a pre-emptive safety measure, a US official said,\u00a0and aid operations across the pier will be suspended until sea conditions allow for it to be moved back into place. Humanitarian aid deliveries across the pier continued for a full day on Friday, the official said, and it is expected to be detached and towed to Ashdod late Friday night local time. \u201cThe decision to temporarily relocate the pier is not made lightly but is necessary to ensure the temporary pier can continue to deliver aid in the future,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement. \u201cAfter the period of expected high seas, the pier will be rapidly re-anchored to the coast of Gaza and resume delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza. Since May 17, over 3,500 metric tons (7.7 million pounds) have been delivered through the maritime corridor for onward delivery by humanitarian organizations,\u201d CENTCOM continued. To date, the pier has been\u00a0used to move\u00a0thousands of tons of aid into Gaza, officials have said, but\u00a0it has been plagued with logistical issues since becoming operational in May. Last month,\u00a0rough seas caused four US Army vessels supporting the pier to break free from their moorings and wash ashore on Israeli beaches.\u00a0Also last month,\u00a0the pier broke\u00a0apart and sustained damage in heavy seas and had to be towed to Ashdod for repairs that took over a week. It was moved back to Gaza last week and resumed operations on Saturday but had to pause again due to heavy seas on Sunday and Monday. Officials have told CNN that\u00a0sea conditions in the eastern Mediterranean will only worsen as fall and winter approach, raising questions about the pier\u2019s realistic lifespan. Meanwhile,\u00a0the World Food Programme\u2019s aid distribution operations at the pier have been suspended for\u00a0days,\u00a0and aid has been piling up in the staging area on the beach in Gaza, officials said this week. The operations will remain paused pending a\u00a0WFP\u00a0risk assessment, which is ongoing after the Israel Defense Forces conducted operations near the pier\u00a0Saturday as part of a hostage rescue operation. The presence of at least one Israeli helicopter so close to the pier led the US military to forcefully push back on any claims that it was used as part of the Israeli operation, reiterating that it is a humanitarian mission only. Once the WFP assessment is completed, it will\u00a0fall on\u00a0the\u00a0United Nations\u2019\u00a0Department of Safety and Security and the humanitarian coordinator to make a decision on whether to resume operations at the pier. Humanitarian officials say\u00a0that\u00a0while\u00a0getting\u00a0any assistance\u00a0into the Gaza\u00a0Strip\u00a0is useful, the pier is not a long-term sustainable solution. The Israeli government for months refused to open additional land crossings for aid into Gaza, and only did so after immense pressure by the US government in recent months. Even with additional openings, major obstacles to distribution within the Gaza\u00a0Strip\u00a0remain,and humanitarian officials tell CNN that there is still not an effective deconfliction method to protect aid workers. CNN reported on Thursday that the US military\u00a0was considering dismantling the pier.

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_campaign-biden-trump-supreme-court-race-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is directly trying to exploit Donald Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in a significant new campaign gambit ahead of their pivotal debate clash next week. The Biden campaign on Monday debuted a new ad that will air in battleground states that blasts the presumptive Republican nominee as a felon who only cares about himself. The strategy appears to resolve a debate among Democrats about how overtly they should highlight the ex-president\u2019s legal woes in a neck and neck White House race. The new front in the 2024 campaign opened up after Trump sought to win votes among Black Americans, a traditional Democratic power base where the ex-president is\u00a0trying to make inroads\u00a0despite\u00a0his\u00a0tarnished\u00a0personal history\u00a0on\u00a0race. This comes as Republicans embrace their presumptive nominee despite his\u00a0conviction and bid to overturn the 2020 election result, going all in on Trump as they seek to win back the White House and the Senate and keep the House. Biden\u2019s new ad zeroes in directly on the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial and his huge loss in a civil fraud case to strike a sharp contrast with Biden\u2019s character.\u00a0As the ex-president\u2019s mug shot flashes on screen, a narrator says: \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who\u2019s only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The ad marks the Biden campaign\u2019s most explicit strategic use so far of Trump\u2019s legal woes in a campaign message. Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu explained the thinking on CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d: \u201cWhat this ad is about is about showing the American people about the issue that\u2019s going to decide this campaign: wisdom, courage, character.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign responded by blasting the hush money trial as \u201celection interference\u201d and highlighted polls showing the former president\u2019s strength in swing states. \u201cThe contrast between President Trump\u2019s strength and success versus Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s weakness, failures, and dishonesty will be made clear on the debate stage next week,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson, wrote on X. Biden, who flew directly from his second trip to Europe within a week to a glitzy Hollywood fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday, argued there that one of the \u201cscariest\u201d parts of a second Trump term would be a possibility that his rival could appoint more hardline conservative Supreme Court justices. Former President Barack Obama, who joined his former vice president at the fundraiser, meanwhile bemoaned the fact that Republicans are set to nominate a candidate who was \u201cconvicted by a jury of his peers on 34 counts.\u201d Candidates position themselves for first presidential debate The campaign is intensifying ahead of 2024\u2019s first presidential debate, on CNN on June 27, a potentially defining moment of a campaign that could see an ex-president beat the sitting president who ousted him from office for only the second time in history. The showdown in Atlanta will take place with 81-year-old Biden under extreme pressure to show he\u2019s up to another four-year term amid pervasive voter concerns about his advanced years and following Trump\u2019s incessant mockery of the visibly aging president\u2019s mental acuity and physical state. The ex-president\u2019s constant ridiculing of Biden\u2019s faculties may, however, be lowering expectations for Biden\u2019s performance, raising the prospect that an energetic showing from the president could have a similar impact to his barnstorming State of the Union address this year, which temporarily quieted concerns over his age. The ex-president\u2019s volatile behavior in recent days, including after he marked his 78th birthday on Friday, is prompting the Biden campaign to argue that Trump\u2019s state of mind \u2014 as well as his attempt to crush American democracy four years ago \u2014\u00a0means he\u2019s unfit for a return to office. Last week, the campaign described Trump as \u201cmore unhinged than ever before\u201d after he returned to Capitol Hill for the first time since the January 6, 2021, mob attack to be embraced by House and Senate GOP lawmakers. The first presidential debate of this campaign is unusually early, meaning it could give the president a chance to jolt a toss-up White House race that has been largely stable for months. Trump is polling strongly in key swing states. Biden is apparently clinging to a narrowing path through the countrywide electoral map to the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. The president is being hampered by the pain felt by many Americans over high prices and elevated interest rates that have made it hard to afford new homes and car loans \u2014 giving Trump an opening to conjure nostalgia about the pre-pandemic economy during his term in office. CNN on Saturday announced new details for the debate, agreed to by both campaigns. The event will take place in a television studio rather than in front of a live audience. It will include two commercial breaks, during which campaign staff will be barred from interacting with their candidate. Both men agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their positions will be determined by a coin flip. Microphones will be muted except when it\u2019s a candidate\u2019s turn to speak. Biden is expected to head to Camp David later this week for an intense debate camp that will involve his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, who has been schooling Democratic candidates ahead of debates for decades. Trump held a policy forum with a group of advisers and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri when he was in Washington last week. His aides insisted that the ex-president would not necessarily engage in traditional debate prep but rely on interviews and rallies to hone his approach. However, Trump\u2019s interviews, mostly with conservative media, are often full of softball questions. And he skipped all the GOP primary debates, so he might not be fully prepared when Biden gets in his grille. Trump seeks to fracture Biden\u2019s support among Black voters In a race that will turn on a handful of swing states that could be decided by mere thousands of votes, any chunks either candidate can take from the other\u2019s core constituency could be crucial. This is why Trump spent Saturday in Michigan, seeking to take advantage of signs of waning enthusiasm for Biden among Black voters. The former president unveiled his \u201cBlack Americans for Trump\u201d coalition, which has the support of prominent Black Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. In a Friday interview with Semafor, Trump declared, \u201cI\u2019m not racist.\u201d He added: \u201cI have so many Black friends that if I were a racist, they wouldn\u2019t be friends, they would know better than anybody, and fast,\u201d he said. Speaking at a predominately Black church in Detroit on Saturday, Trump falsely claimed that Black workers did far better in his first term than under Biden in an effort to leverage the cornerstone of his campaign \u2014 immigration \u2014 into an appeal to minorities he claims are losing their jobs to undocumented migrants. He is also highlighting Biden\u2019s role as a senator in passing a 1990s crime bill that resulted in high rates of incarceration among Black citizens. According to CNN exit polls in 2020, Trump won about 1 in 10 Black voters. But a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found the ex-president winning more than 20% of Black voters in battleground states. If he can depress Biden\u2019s advantage among the key demographic in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee, Trump could improve his chances of winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, states that form Biden\u2019s best path to keep the White House. The Biden campaign hit back at Trump\u2019s appeal to a reliable core constituency that helped lift Biden to the presidency, highlighting controversies, including Trump\u2019s demand for the death penalty against five youths who were wrongly convicted of an assault and rape in Central Park in the 1980s and his racist campaign over Obama\u2019s birthplace. \u201cWe sure haven\u2019t forgotten Trump repeatedly cozying up to white supremacists and demonizing Black communities to his political benefit \u2014 because that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019ll do if he wins a second term,\u201d said Jasmine Harris, the director of Black media for the Biden campaign. Obama also took a shot at the presumptive GOP nominee when asked by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel at the Los Angeles fundraiser what he thought about Trump\u2019s claims that he\u2019d done more for Black people than any president in history. The former commander in chief replied: \u201cOne thing he did, for example, was make them feel even better about the first Black president.\u201d Biden slams \u2018out of kilter\u2019 Supreme Court majority Political fundraisers are often closed. But the Biden campaign seemed keen to show the president in an informal setting with Obama and stars including Julia Roberts and George Clooney. The president stopped in Washington only to refuel Air Force One on the way home from the G7 summit in Italy before the event, which came days after his surviving son, Hunter Biden, was found guilty on gun charges following a trial in Delaware. The president\u2019s campaign on Sunday released a video from the fundraiser in which Biden referenced the controversy surrounding flags raised by Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s wife that critics have warned are politically provocative. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019s going to appoint two more flying flags upside down,\u201d Biden said. Asked by Kimmel whether he considered this the scariest part of a second Trump term, Biden responded, \u201cIt is one of the scariest parts.\u201d The president added: \u201cThe Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today, I mean never.\u201d For years before the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, Republicans put the destiny of the nation\u2019s top court at the center of their presidential election campaigns. Biden gave the clearest indication yet this weekend that Democrats are now desperate to play on the same turf.

His defense attorneys filed the motion seeking a new trial in the morning but then told the court to remove it from the docket, without publicly providing a reason.\u00a0Biden\u2019s lawyers have not responded to requests for comment. The now-removed\u00a0court filings argued\u00a0that there was a technical hiccup with the courts, related to Hunter Biden\u2019s pretrial appeals, that should\u2019ve prevented the trial judge from proceeding to a jury trial in Delaware. This challenge is similar to several of Biden\u2019s previous legal gambits to\u00a0delay or derail\u00a0the case, which have all fallen flat in court. \u201cThe Court empaneled a jury and proceeded to trial before the Court of Appeals returned jurisdiction to the Court by issuing its mandate. Consequently, the conviction must be vacated here,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers told the trial judge in the Monday filing, which was reviewed by CNN before it was removed from the docket. The apparent\u00a0request for a new trial comes after\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s historic conviction\u00a0\u2013 the first time the son of a sitting US president went on trial while his father was in the White House. These latest legal maneuvers relate to what\u2019s called a \u201cmandate.\u201d When an appellate court hands down a decision, it notifies the lower court of that decision by issuing a \u201cmandate,\u201d often a couple days or weeks later. This mechanism is typically how the lower court gets back jurisdiction for the case, to proceed with the case as appropriate. In this case, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claimed in the Monday filing\u00a0that even though they lost their pretrial appeals, the 3rd\u00a0US\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals never issued its final \u201cmandate\u201d that would\u2019ve returned the case back to District Judge Maryellen Noreika. She presided over a jury trial that began June 3 and ended last week with guilty verdicts on all charges. Noreika said in previous rulings that she believes Biden\u2019s appeals \u201cwill not independently divest this Court of jurisdiction\u201d and that her trial court and the federal appellate court \u201cshall have jurisdiction to proceed.\u201d The Delaware-based jury\u00a0found Hunter Biden guilty\u00a0of three felonies stemming from his October 2018 purchase of a revolver at a Wilmington gun shop. The jury unanimously concluded that he lied about his drug use on federal background check forms, and possessed the weapon while addicted to or using illegal drugs, which is a federal crime. Hunter Biden has spoken publicly about his lifelong struggle with alcoholism and his spiral into crack cocaine addiction after his brother Beau Biden died from cancer in 2015. Prosecutors\u00a0used his memoir against him, and also\u00a0relied on testimony\u00a0from three former romantic partners who said his rampant drug use destroyed their relationships. The president\u2019s son also is facing a separate trial on federal tax offenses, which is scheduled to begin in September.

The debate, which will be hosted by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta on June 27, will mark the first in-person showdown of the 2024 campaign between President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and his predecessor, former President\u00a0Donald Trump. Both candidates have accepted the network\u2019s invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May. The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. Both candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. Some aspects of the debate \u2013 including the absence of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates. But, as in the past, the moderators \u201cwill use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\u201d according to the network. In order to meet CNN\u2019s qualifications for the debate, candidates must satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets. Participants must also file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so. All participating debaters must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Though not impossible in Kennedy\u2019s case, it is less likely that candidates other than Biden and Trump will meet those requirements. Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/trump-biden-cnn-debate-rules/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Steny Hoyer will lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to Israel this week, a notable show of support\u00a0as a sizable number of Democrats say they are considering boycotting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress next month. Nine House members will participate in meetings with Israeli leaders with the goal of securing updates on the state of the war in Gaza, as well as the humanitarian situation there, according to a statement from Hoyer\u2019s office. The congressional delegation will also discuss the ongoing efforts to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. \u201cI look forward to strengthening our vital US-Israel relationship even further during my first visit to Israel since the terror and devastation of October 7,\u201d Hoyer said in a news release. \u201cBoth on this delegation and upon our return, we will continue working to maintain the strong, longstanding bipartisan consensus in Congress to support our ally, Israel.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s speech on July 24 will arrive at a time when his relationship with\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0has\u00a0become strained over Israel\u2019s war plans\u00a0and efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Gaza. While Congress\u00a0passed a bill with aid\u00a0to Ukraine and Israel in April, Democrats remain divided over Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas. It\u2019s not clear whether the prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington will include a meeting at the White House. Netanyahu has\u00a0yet to publicly endorse\u00a0a peace proposal laid out by Biden, and\u00a0the US\u00a0has grown frustrated\u00a0by some of Israel\u2019s war tactics, which officials believe do not include stringent enough protections for civilians. CNN has spoken to dozens of Democratic lawmakers who have said they are considering boycotting Netanyahu\u2019s speech, with several already publicly announcing their plans to not attend. In 2015, at the height of tensions between Netanyahu and then-President Barack Obama, nearly 60 Democrats across both chambers did not attend a speech by the Israeli prime minister to a joint session of Congress. \u201cIf he wants to come to speak to members of Congress about how to end the war and release hostages, I would be fine doing that,\u201d Rep.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who\u00a0called for new elections in Israel\u00a0earlier this year, acknowledged in a statement that he had \u201cclear and profound disagreements\u201d with Netanyahu, but he has defended his decision to sign on to the letter inviting the Israeli leader. \u201cBecause America\u2019s relationship with Israel is ironclad and transcends one person or prime minister,\u00a0I joined the request for him to speak,\u201d he said earlier this month.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Garret Graves of Louisiana announced Friday that he will not seek reelection, ending months of uncertainty after a new congressional map made his seat significantly Democratic. \u201cRepresenting South Louisiana and serving in the United States Congress has been an incredible honor,\u201d Graves said in a statement, before adding that \u201crunning for Congress this year does not make sense.\u201d Amid a long and winding legal battle over the congressional lines in Louisiana, the US Supreme Court last month allowed the state to use the new map\u00a0in this year\u2019s elections. A federal judge had previously thrown out the existing map, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. While Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its six-member US House delegation. Under the new lines crafted by the GOP-controlled state Legislature, Grave\u2019s 6th Congressional District was redrawn into Louisiana\u2019s second Black-majority district \u2013 one that Joe Biden would have carried by 20 points in 2020. Graves\u2019 announcement will come as a blow to House Republicans, who are looking to defend their razor-thin majority in the chamber. There had been speculation that Graves could try to challenge a fellow Republican incumbent in a neighboring district. But House Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Louisianan, endorsed all Republican incumbents in the state\u2019s delegation last month, including Graves for reelection to his current 6th District seat. The congressman conceded Friday that running for a different seat this year was not an option. \u201cIt is evident that a run in any temporary district will cause actual permanent damage to Louisiana\u2019s great representation in Congress,\u201d he said in remarks that hinted at potential further legal challenges to the new map. In recent months, Graves has faced opposition from within his own party, at home and in Washington. The new map, which made Graves\u2019 seat more Democratic, was backed by Louisiana\u2019s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Graves backed Landry\u2019s opponent in the state\u2019s gubernatorial primary last year. Graves was also among the closest allies of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted from his leadership post in October. In the lead-up to the historic vote, Graves slammed hard-line members of the House GOP conference who were dangling the threat of ousting McCarthy amid efforts to pass stopgap funding legislation. McCarthy reacted to Graves\u2019 announcement in a social media post Friday evening, describing the Louisiana Republican as \u201ca loyal friend\u201d and \u201cthe best of what public service can and should be.\u201d \u201cNo matter the issue, Garret was the first to jump in with enthusiasm, intellect, and a legendary sense of humor,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that Graves\u2019 \u201cabsence will be a major loss for the conference and the entire House.\u201d Graves was first elected to Congress in 2014, succeeding fellow Republican Bill Cassidy, who vacated the seat for a successful US Senate run. Under the current lines, the 6th District, which includes parts of the Baton Rouge area, has been a Republican stronghold. But the redrawn district now leans decidedly Democratic, stretching from Shreveport in the state\u2019s northwest to Baton Rouge. Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress for two terms in the 1990s, is seen as the front-runner in the district\u2019s jungle primary in November.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_social-security-medicare-election-what-matters", "text": "Unlike most Republicans who have been critical of former President Donald Trump, former House Speaker Paul Ryan is not about to make an endorsement or even indicate he\u2019ll grudgingly vote for Trump. Arguing Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d for office, Ryan, a Republican who represented the battleground state of Wisconsin in Congress, said on Fox News this week that he\u2019ll write in some other Republican \u2013 a conservative rather than a populist like Trump. It was a notable moment, particularly since it occurred on Fox News, where opposition to Trump is hard to come by. Ryan, who has turned to a lucrative career on Wall Street since leaving politics, remains on the board of the conservative network\u2019s parent company. \u201cI would prefer a party that is based on principles, not personality or populism,\u201d Ryan said, describing himself as \u201can anti-establishment Republican at this time.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning turn for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, to be so out of whack with his party. Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who selected Ryan as his running mate, is also now effectively a member of the shrinking Republican resistance to Trump. A promise to do nothing Like many Americans, Ryan said he isn\u2019t happy with either of the major-party candidates, but he has a very specific reason for concern. It\u2019s worth taking a closer look at his important point. \u201cThey\u2019re both promising not to tackle the debt,\u201d Ryan said, coming back to the issue that has animated his political career. \u201cAll the First World countries have the same issue we have: baby boomers retiring and unfunded entitlements coming due, and massive amount of debt,\u201d he said, referring to Social Security and Medicare, on which millions of aging Americans rely for their quality of life but which also eat up a growing portion of federal spending. For the record, both President Joe Biden and Trump have sworn they will not cut benefits. When Trump suggested in an interview in March that he might be open to Medicare and Social Security cuts, his campaign quickly made clear that no, he was talking about waste, not touching the programs themselves. He attacked other Republicans during the primary for being open to reforming these programs. $34 trillion and counting The current US national debt exceeds $34 trillion, a figure that has exploded under both parties. Pandemic-era spending had bipartisan support. Republicans passed massive tax cuts under Trump. Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act under Biden and the Affordable Care Act under then-President Barack Obama. Ryan is absolutely correct that neither side, at least at the presidential level, is making action on the debt a political priority. \u201cYou can fix it if you have the political will,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the political will right now. We don\u2019t have serious politics right now.\u201d Whether and exactly how concerned to be with that debt is a matter of intense debate among policy wonks and economists, but the idea that the US is on an unsustainable path is generally accepted. More focus on tax cuts Meanwhile, in the larger political conversation, there\u2019s more focus on how or whether to extend Trump-era tax cuts that will expire next year. CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby has a look at the opposing promises from Biden and Trump. Trump wants to extend all of the tax cuts, which could further explode the debt without corresponding spending cuts. Biden, on the other hand, wants to allow the cuts to expire only for those making $400,000 and up. He would also try raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. When Trump and Republicans enacted the current tax structure, they made individual tax cuts temporary and most of the corporate tax cuts permanent. Democrats are also hoping to use the tax debate as leverage to increase social safety net spending. More from Luhby: Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced\u00a0child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous\u00a0Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the\u00a0American Rescue Plan Act\u00a0that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. Her story \u2013 read it here \u2013 outlines more of the looming tax implications and spells out the argument that the Trump tax cuts were a huge success alongside the opposing argument that they were a total failure. What\u2019s not up for debate is that the debt has grown, by trillions of dollars, under both Trump and Biden. Fearing \u2018radical budget surgery\u2019 Ryan fears a future when the Treasury Department can no longer sell the interest-bearing bonds that fund deficit spending, at which point the government would essentially have to print money to cover expenses. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a dollar crisis. That\u2019s when the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency is called into question. That\u2019s a huge privilege we could lose,\u201d he said, arguing it would lead to \u201cradical budget surgery\u201d \u2013 steep, painful cuts \u2013 to get out of the crisis. Solve the problem now or solve the problem later, he is arguing, but solving it now will be less painful. Tough choices could come sooner than you think Social Security won\u2019t be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035 unless Congress acts, according to a government forecast. Spending on the program will balloon, and the trust funds that currently fund it will run dry. At that point, the payroll tax and other income sources that fund Social Security will only be able to pay 83% of benefits. Congress will be forced to do something. It\u2019s a similar story with a slightly different timeline for Medicare. \u201cIf you step ahead of this problem, you can solve the insolvency of these entitlement programs without affecting anyone\u2019s benefits who are on them today,\u201d Ryan said. The broad strokes of what needs to be done are generally known and have been suggested by a variety of commissions, foundations and economic policy groups. The fixes could include incrementally raising the retirement age over the coming years and changing the funding structure for the systems to raise more money. Biden has proposed additional taxes on those making more than $400,000 to address Medicare\u2019s solvency, among other ideas, but does not have a detailed Social Security plan. Ryan has previously endorsed reform Ryan, to his credit, proposed some of the more revolutionary changes earlier in his career. When House Republicans passed versions of those plans, he paid a political price. They arguably contributed to his and Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. \u201cThe problem is, doing what I just said, you lay yourself out there for ridicule,\u201d Ryan said on Fox. \u201cYou lay yourself out there for political shots.\u201d He added: \u201cInvariably, the political demagoguery makes it look like you\u2019re taking something away from people. The dirty little secret in all of this is, Medicare and Social Security are going insolvent on their own. That means they go bankrupt. That means current seniors do get their benefits cut if we do nothing.\u201d But Ryan also deserves some blame He was House speaker, for instance, when Republicans passed those Trump tax cuts in 2017, which cut government income without addressing spending. Ryan suggested a fix to the problem now could be a commission set up to create a path to solvency and which would be able to force a vote in Congress. There are previous examples of such commissions, such as the one helmed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in 1983. Ryan actually sat on another one during the Obama administration. Chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, it was called the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and it sought a bipartisan menu of tough choices to deal with the unsustainable path it has been clear the US has been on for a long time. When it came time to endorse those proposals, however, Ryan voted no, helping kill the commission.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/social-security-medicare-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_politics_virginia-2024-turning-red", "text": "Republicans are openly floating that this will finally be the year that Virginia shifts from the Democratic column it\u2019s been in for several presidential elections and back into the battleground category where Donald Trump could win. The prospect of turning the state red was the topic of discussion between the former president and Virginia GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin when they met last week, according to a source with knowledge of the meeting. That hope, which GOP strategists and the chair of the Republican National Committee have aired publicly, is partially based on a recent poll showing the presidential race tightening there, and partially the fact that the state has a Republican governor and a state legislature narrowly controlled by Democrats. \u201cWe are seeing real momentum on the ground in Virginia,\u201d RNC chair Michael Whatley said on X recently. Zack Roday, a Republican strategist who works for Youngkin\u2019s political action committee, pointed to recent elections in the state as signs that it is truly a battleground, and, in a year where Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is polling competitively with President Joe Biden nationally, that means the commonwealth is winnable for Republicans. In 2021, Youngkin defeated former Gov. Terry McAuliffe by 2 points, a year after Biden carried the commonwealth by 10 points. Republicans also flipped a US House seat in the 2nd congressional district in 2022 and came close in the state\u2019s 7th congressional district that same year. \u201cYoungkin has clearly moved the state where it\u2019s more competitive, but will it translate to a federal race?\u201d Roday said. \u201cIf we\u2019re here in September and October and it\u2019s 45-45 or 48-48, that\u2019s just really bad\u00a0news [for Democrats] because we\u2019re playing on Democratic terrain.\u201d Votings ends in Virginia\u2019s Republican and Democratic primaries on Tuesday. The results of those races will offer glimpse into potential turnout and enthusiasm among Republicans and Democrats alike in the general election. Youngkin\u2019s PAC has been active in looking to boost Virginia Republicans this year with eyes on the 2nd and 7th congressional seats in particular. The governor has been on an ongoing heavy media blitz, and the PAC has built a large amount of voter data from recent elections. The PAC has also been active in coordinating with the Trump campaign on data and targeting, according to a Republican strategist with knowledge of that work. Neither Trump nor Biden have spent significantly in Virginia during the general election at this point. The Biden campaign has spent just over $23,000 on digital ads, while the Trump campaign has not spent any money at all, ad tracking data shows. Democrats are skeptical about any Republican chest-thumping for Virginia. \u201cBiden is not taking any blue-ish state like Virginia for granted,\u201d said Max Glass, a veteran Democratic campaign manager. \u201cIf you look at Donald Trump\u2019s numbers in the Republican primary, there was over 250,000 voters who chose not to vote for him. He only got 63%of the vote. Where are those other voters going to go? I don\u2019t see them now that he\u2019s convicted willing to change their mind and return to Trump.\u201d Another veteran Virginia Democratic strategist argued that \u201cthe demographics aren\u2019t there\u201d for Republicans. Democrats, the strategist said, fare well in Virginia whenever Trump is on the ballot. The exception was the year when Youngkin won and Trump was less in the campaign spotlight. \u201cThat is the only period of time where Donald Trump was highly irrelevant. In 2022 races, he was extremely relevant. He was out on the campaign trail. He was doing stuff. \u2026 And when Trump is front and center, Democrats have won.\u201d A Republican presidential candidate hasn\u2019t won Virginia in a presidential election since the George W. Bush reelection campaign in 2004, but prior to that, Republicans dominated the state for 40 years. There hasn\u2019t been a Republican senator representing the state since\u00a0John Warner retired in 2009. This year, Sen. Tim Kaine, a two-term Democrat senator, is running for reelection and is the clear favorite in the race. Hedging bets Privately, Virginia Republicans are more unsure about the GOP\u2019s\u00a0chances in Virginia. They see national headwinds that could buoy Republican chances in this year\u2019s Senate race, as well as Trump\u2019s prospects, but concede that it\u2019s still an uphill battle. \u201cTrump lost to Biden by 10 (points) in the last general, on-year, statewide,\u201d a veteran Virginia Republican strategist, who asked for anonymity to share their mixed views about Republicans\u2019 chances going forward. \u201cVirginia is trending purple but that is a hell of a hill to climb.\u201d Any discussion about Virginia becoming more fertile ground for Republicans again is the latest in a set of floats that a handful of reliably Democratic states could actually, truly flip to Republican leaning states this cycle if Trump wins \u2013 the others being Minnesota, New Hampshire or New Jersey. At a recent appearance in Wildwood, New Jersey, Trump repeatedly suggested that he could win New Jersey in 2024. Biden defeated Trump in New Jersey by nearly 16 points in 2020. \u201cI think there are three states right now that people don\u2019t consider battlegrounds right now \u2013 Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Virginia,\u201d said Jim McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who has done work for the Trump campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d\u00a0 he added, speaking of Republicans\u2019 chances to compete in Virginia. McLaughlin added that it hasn\u2019t been that long since\u00a0 former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell got about 58% of the vote there in his successful 2009 gubernatorial race. Trump himself has shown a persistent interest in being able to say he flipped some of these states. \u201cI thought we won it in 2016,\u201d Trump said of Minnesota in May during a fundraiser for the state Republican party. \u201cI know we won it in 2020.\u201d Trump did not win Minnesota in either race. In 2020,\u00a0 Biden won it by about 230,000 votes, or 7 percentage points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Trump in Minnesota by almost 44,000 votes \u2013 less than 2 points. At a recent donor summit, the former president\u2019s top advisers walked attendees through each state, making an effort to argue the potential to compete in both Virginia and Minnesota, according to multiple attendees of that presentation. But Virginia Republicans are more cautious about their party\u2019s chances of actually winning the Old Dominion. \u201cI believe the polling I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Travis Smith, a Richmond, Virginia-based strategist. \u201cIf Virginia is in play, it\u2019ll be a landslide.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/politics/virginia-2024-turning-red/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_politics_bannon-turning-point-trump-retribution", "text": "Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of Donald Trump, vowed investigations and prosecutions of those who have probed the former president and his political allies, declaring at a conservative gathering Saturday that Inauguration Day in 2025 will be \u201caccountability day.\u201d Pointing to Trump\u2019s recent conviction in New York, Bannon told a crowd at Turning Point Action\u2019s \u201cThe People\u2019s Convention\u201d in Detroit, hours before Trump was scheduled to speak, that the former president\u2019s allies are going to \u201cget every single receipt.\u201d \u201cYou are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has nothing to do with retribution. It has nothing to do with revenge. Because retribution and revenge might be another order of magnitude. This has to do with justice.\u201d Bannon was referring to\u00a0recent comments by Trump vowing to be his supporters\u2019 \u201cretribution\u201d\u00a0and saying\u00a0that \u201csometimes revenge can be justified.\u201d Trump has repeatedly bypassed opportunities from friendly interviewers \u2014 including multiple conversations with Fox News host and friend Sean Hannity \u2014 to dial back his rhetoric and walk away from threats of retaliation against his political opponents and over his criminal prosecutions. \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president told Hannity earlier this month. Some Trump allies, including another veteran of his 2016 campaign and the Trump White House, former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, have downplayed the former president\u2019s comments. Earlier this month, Conway noted that Trump\u2019s Justice Department did not try to prosecute Hillary Clinton despite the chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d at 2016 campaign rallies. But other allies have responded more forcefully to Trump\u2019s conviction in his New York hush money trial. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo, an attorney in the prosecutor\u2019s office, testify \u201cabout the unprecedented political prosecution of President Trump.\u201d In response to the verdict, several Republican senators \u2014 including vice presidential contenders Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio \u2014 signed a letter signifying they would not work with the Biden administration to pass legislation, confirm his judicial nominees or increase non-security spending. Bannon\u2019s incendiary speech comes two weeks before he is due to report to prison. He was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 after failing to provide documents and testimony to the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. He was sentenced to four months in prison, and a federal judge earlier this month ordered him to report to prison by July 1. Once a top adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and a senior White House aide, the bombastic Bannon is now a right-wing podcaster with a following of loyal Trump supporters. He is no longer the Trump insider he once was, but Bannon was influential in House conservatives\u2019 ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and he has taken credit for the removal of former Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. His \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast has also been a megaphone for false claims of election fraud and a rewriting of the history of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Rallying the room around the former president\u2019s recent conviction in New York, Bannon claimed, without elaborating, that Trump is \u201celigible for 700 years in prison\u201d and \u201cthey want him to serve all of it.\u201d Trump\u2019s sentencing in the New York case, so far his only criminal conviction in the four cases he faces, is set for July 11. The judge can sentence the former president to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. Bannon pointed to Trump allies such as Roger Stone and Rudy Giuliani who have been prosecuted and claimed, \u201cthey\u2019re turning people into political prisoners and sending people to prison, and they will send every one of you in this audience to prison also.\u201d Bannon told the crowd they are the \u201cvanguard of this revolution,\u201d adding, \u201cwe are not prepared to be governed by criminals\u201d and vowing to \u201cpurge\u201d the Justice Department and \u201ctake apart\u201d the FBI. \u201cNovember 5 is judgment day. January 20, 2025, will be accountability day,\u201d Bannon said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/politics/bannon-turning-point-trump-retribution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Both the US Treasury Department and the US State Department took action against the Tzav 9 movement for its repeated obstruction of the aid. The sanctions against the organization are the latest punitive measure taken under an executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank. They come as the US continues to grapple with the crisis in Gaza, where humanitarian officials say the situation has reached one of its lowest points in the entire\u00a0eight-month\u00a0conflict The Tzav 9 movement, a grouping of demobilized reservists, families of hostages and settlers, has been\u00a0leading protests\u00a0to disrupt the critical aid convoys at\u00a0Kerem Shalom, the country\u2019s sole functioning border crossing with Gaza. Its name, meaning \u201cOrder 9,\u201d is a reference to the emergency mobilization notices that call up reservists. At the end of February, the area was declared a closed military zone, due to international pressure, but protesters continued to arrive and try to outmaneuver the police. \u201cFor months, individuals from Tzav 9 have repeatedly sought to thwart the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including by blockading roads, sometimes violently, along their route from Jordan to Gaza, including in the West Bank,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Friday. \u201cThey also have damaged aid trucks and dumped life-saving humanitarian aid onto the road.\u00a0 On May 13, 2024, Tzav 9 members looted and then set fire to two trucks near Hebron in the West Bank carrying humanitarian aid destined for men, women, and children in Gaza,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_george-norcross-racketeering", "text": "New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross was charged Monday with operating a racketeering enterprise, threatening people whose properties he sought to take over, and orchestrating tax incentive legislation to benefit organizations he controlled. Norcross, seated in the front row during a news conference by New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, angrily denounced the charges, later calling Platkin a \u201ccoward\u201d and demanding a speedy trial. The charges against the 68-year-old Norcross and five others come as New Jersey is already under a political and legal microscope, with Democratic Sen.\u00a0Bob Menendez on trial in New York\u00a0on federal corruption charges. Platkin, also a Democrat, cast the charges as law enforcement cracking down on wrongdoing. \u201cWhen we say no one is above the law, we mean it, and we will continue to hold accountable anyone who puts their interest above the public interest, no matter how powerful they may be,\u201d Platkin said. In a 111-page indictment unsealed Monday, the attorney general alleges a scheme reaching back to 2012 in which the defendants \u2014 called the \u201cNorcross Enterprise\u201d in the indictment \u2014 used his political influence to craft legislation that served their interests. Among the allegations against Norcross are charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross\u2019 terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \u201cenormous consequences.\u201d The person asks whether Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Norcross replies. The indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden\u2019s waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline. Defense lawyer Michael Critchley accused Platkin of having a \u201cvendetta\u201d against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as by Platkin\u2019s predecessor. \u201cAnd every agency that looked at this matter for the past seven years \u2026 came up with nothing,\u201d Critchley said at a news conference. Norcross, the executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state. He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide. Norcross, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, who was once listed as a member of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club, cast the prosecution as politically motivated. He said Platkin blamed southern New Jersey Democrats for fallout from\u00a0allegations that a staff member on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s 2017 gubernatorial campaign\u00a0had been sexually assaulted. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that fallout was. Platkin was Murphy\u2019s general counsel when the state Legislature investigated the\u00a0allegations. \u201cI want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself, because he\u2019s a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will,\u201d Norcross said Monday outside the attorney general\u2019s office. In explaining why he appeared at the news conference, Norcross said, \u201cI want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he\u2019s holier than thou.\u201d The other defendants are Norcross\u2019 brother Philip Norcross, a New Jersey lawyer; William Tambussi, George Norcross\u2019 longtime lawyer; Dana Redd, Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden mayor; Sidney Brown, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John O\u2019Donnell. An attorney representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \u201cunblemished reputation.\u201d \u201cThe notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\u201d Kevin Marino said. Marino declined to address specific allegations in the indictment. Philip Norcross and Rep. Donald Norcross of New Jersey are all brothers of George. Donald Norcross said in a statement that he looks forward to his brothers telling their side of the story. \u201cI love my brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the rule of law, and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court.\u201d Henry Klingeman, Redd\u2019s attorney, said she was surprised by the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s done nothing wrong,\u201d Klingeman said. \u201cWhat she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others.\u201d Messages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambussi. Brown and O\u2019Donnell had no attorneys yet, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. Monday\u2019s indictment wasn\u2019t the first time the tax incentive has come under scrutiny. Murphy\u2019s administration ordered a task force to investigate tax incentives not long after he took office in 2018.\u00a0In 2019, Norcross disputed resulting allegations\u00a0that there was anything corrupt about the incentives that benefited his companies.

{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump got his 78th birthday present a day early \u2014 a handshake from his longtime bitter critic, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0encapsulating the Republican Party\u2019s complete submission to its presumptive presidential nominee. The twice-impeached 45th president and newly convicted criminal was back on Capitol Hill Thursday for the first time since his supporters beat up police officers and smashed their way through the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. A rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d from House Republicans contrasted with the cries from more than three years ago to \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d from Trump\u2019s mob as they acted on his plea to \u201cfight like hell\u201d after weeks of promoting false claims about election fraud. Keen to please their champion and create an optimistic omen for November, House members paid tribute to the ex-president with a bat and game ball they won after trouncing Democrats in the annual congressional baseball game Wednesday. There was a distinct impression of subordinates paying homage to a strongman leader. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 primary opponent now seen as a potential GOP vice presidential nominee, called it \u201cgetting the team back together\u201d after GOP senators feted Trump a mere two weeks after he became the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. Another 2016 foe of the ex-president, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who endured insults Trump flung at his father and his wife, stood to applaud his vanquisher. But the most striking image from the day was a handshake between McConnell and the ex-president captured in a photo by Doug Mills of The New York Times that sums up an era. The veteran Kentucky senator has never hidden his disdain for Trump, though he has always sought to preserve his own power and didn\u2019t take steps to convict him in Senate trials after his two impeachments. The dislike has been mutual, with the former president blasting McConnell as \u201cthe old crow\u201d at rallies and making racist comments about McConnell\u2019s wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. In January 2021, McConnell said, \u201cThe mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president.\u201d He said Trump was morally and practically responsible for the assault on his beloved Capitol. On Thursday, after meeting Trump for the first time since that day of infamy, he lauded their \u201centirely positive\u201d encounter, during which the former president clasped McConnell\u2019s hand in both of his. It would strain credulity that McConnell has shed his private contempt for the ex-president. But he told reporters who asked him about their meeting: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to tell you that was negative.\u201d The exchange between McConnell and Trump was an apt emblem for a day that Trump choreographed to show a coming together in his party \u2013 despite the thousands of votes cast in GOP primaries for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for months after she suspended her campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\u201d the ex-president said. \u201cWe want to see borders. We want to see strong military. We want to see money not wasted all over the world.\u201d How Trump asserts power Trump\u2019s assertion of omnipotence over his party was an example of the power projection he adores, which often requires the subordination of supplicants. And it also showed what Republicans who want their own power are prepared to do to keep it. The pageant of adulation on Capitol Hill was also yet another reminder that there will be no price for Trump to pay in his party for an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power. And it was likely a preview of the deference to Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts and zeal for vengeance that America can expect from Republicans in Washington should he win back the White House \u2013 even from those in a branch of government that is supposed to constrain presidents. Another of Trump\u2019s possible vice-presidential picks, Ohio Sen J.D. Vance, was asked how some senior Republicans who had condemned Trump after January 6 could meet and applaud him now. \u201cNo real Republican with any credibility in the party is still blaming him,\u201d Vance, who had not yet been elected at the time, said, adding that some of Trump\u2019s critics in the room were supportive. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing and the Republican Party is in a good place.\u201d Vance is not wrong. Almost every major Republican who stood up to Trump in 2021 is gone or on the way out of the door. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney is retiring. Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was driven out of House leadership and then Congress for telling the truth about his election lies. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan harshly criticized Trump this week for breaking his oath of office to uphold the Constitution. But his comments on Fox News came amid a comfortable retirement, all his ambition long gone. Lawmakers who stood alongside Trump on Thursday did not necessarily do it because they like him. His huge popularity in the grassroots GOP means that they know that they can say goodbye to their political futures if they choose not to. This is even the case when Trump\u2019s deportment insults the normal codes of behavior expected of a presidential nominee. Biden speaks of democracy abroad while Trump undermines it at home Trump\u2019s return to Washington came the day before he turned 78, the age at which President Joe Biden \u2014 whom his predecessor says is too old to serve \u2014 took office after beating him in the 2020 election. Their 2024 rematch is neck-and-neck, according to polls, with each seeking to make the contest a referendum on the other\u2019s single term. Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to try to exploit Trump\u2019s return visit to a city he left scarred and traumatized by the Capitol riot, releasing a new campaign video that showed scenes of the assault. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more sacred than our democracy, but Donald Trump\u2019s ready to burn it all down,\u201d a narrator said in the ad, which is airing in battleground states. Biden, 81, was thousands of miles away from Washington when Trump showed up, participating in the G7 summit in Italy. It\u2019s the second foreign trip in two weeks he is using an as allegory for a US presidential season he is trying to cast as a fight to save American democracy. Unveiling a series of new plans to boost Ukraine diplomatically, militarily and economically, the president recalled that the US and its allies had been repeatedly asked whether they\u2019d stand firm for a country that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to wipe off the map. \u201cWe will say it again, yes, again and again and again we\u2019re going to stand with Ukraine,\u201d Biden said, as he stood with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A flurry of initiatives to institutionalize Western support for Ukraine being unveiled at the summit are a clear effort to hedge against the possibility that Trump could return to power on January 20, 2025. The ex-president frequently cozied up to Putin while in office and has said he\u2019d end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours \u2014 a feat that could only be achieved by locking in Russia\u2019s territorial gains after its brutal invasion Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton warned on Thursday that Biden could not guarantee that the 10-year pact that covers military training, intelligence cooperation and other areas that he signed with Zelensky on Thursday would last. \u201cI think it is illusory, though, for anyone to think Trump would be bound by it. If Trump is inaugurated at noon on January 20 next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,\u201d Bolton told Bianna Golodryga on CNN International. If Trump gets elected and does walk away from Ukraine, he will complete the transformation of a Republican Party that once prided itself in standing up for democracy worldwide and that, under President Ronald Reagan, won the Cold War. \u201cYou can\u2019t bind a future president who doesn\u2019t want to be bound,\u201d Bolton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-gop-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_media-outlets-use-deceptively-edited-video-to-claim-biden-wandered-off-at-g7-summit", "text": "Right-wing media outlets used a deceptively cropped video to misleadingly claim President Joe Biden wandered off during an event with other world leaders at the G7 summit in Italy on Thursday. Video shared by the New York Post on X showed part of a skydiving demonstration in front of several world leaders in Italy that involved several parachutists landing near the group, with each skydiver carrying a flag representing the different G7 countries. In the full, unedited video, Biden \u2013 who was standing with the group of leaders as a parachutist carrying a G7 banner landed in front of them \u2013 briefly turned away to give a thumbs-up to several parachutists who had landed behind the group, along with a parachute rigger who was kneeling on the ground to pack up one of the skydiver\u2019s chutes and the French flag. Other leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron, also briefly look toward that group. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni then walks toward Biden, taps him on the arm, and motions for him to join the other leaders who were being briefed by an Italian Army officer about the demonstration they just watched. But the video shared by the Post on X cropped out the kneeling parachute rigger, omitting the context of why Biden walked away from the group. \u201cPresident Biden appeared to wander off at the G7 summit in Italy, with officials needing to pull him back to focus,\u201d the social-media post said. That claim later became the basis of the Post\u2019s Friday front page, which called Biden the \u201cMEANDER IN CHIEF\u201d and accused the president of embarrassing the US with \u201cconfused wanderings.\u201d The White House on Thursday criticized the Post and outlets for characterizing the president as \u201cconfused\u201d and for using an \u201cartificially narrow frame\u201d to make it appear as if the president was wandering off from the skydiving demonstration. \u201cHe\u2019s saying congratulations to one of the divers and giving a thumbs up,\u201d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a post on\u00a0social media. \u201cBeware cheap fakes \u2026 and all the bad faith actors who post them,\u201d White House communications director Ben LaBolt\u00a0also posted. X later added a community note to the Post\u2019s tweet acknowledging the video had been cropped. A spokesperson for the Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Edited video goes through conservative echo chamber The video of Biden at the skydiving demonstration appeared to have first been flagged by the Republican National Committee, which posted the uncropped video of Biden giving the parachutists a thumbs-up shortly after the demonstration took place. The New York Post shared the cropped version less than 90 minutes later. Other right-wing outlets quickly followed suit. Sinclair stations posted stories saying Biden appeared to wander away at the summit. Those\u00a0stories\u00a0also resurfaced false claims that the president soiled himself at a D-Day ceremony in France earlier this month. A Fox & Friends segment Friday morning reported on the incident and the Post\u2019s front page, with a chyron saying the president appeared \u201cconfused\u201d at the summit. Other world leaders who attended the event with Biden, though, pushed back on the idea that he was confused. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was standing just steps away from Biden, said the president \u201cwas being very polite and went over to talk to all of (the skydivers) individually.\u201d \u201cGiorgia was saying don\u2019t worry they\u2019re all coming \u2013 we were meant to line up and they were coming to shake our hands,\u201d Sunak said,\u00a0according to\u00a0The Telegraph. Cropped video plays on concerns over Biden\u2019s age While emerging technologies like artificial intelligence continue to proliferate and create concern about the impact that misinformation will have on voters ahead of November, the video shared by the Post shows that relatively low-tech efforts, like cropping videos to show Biden out of context, can still be powerful tools to reinforce the idea that the 81-year-old president has lost control of his mental faculties. Every day that Biden is president, he sets a new record as the oldest person to ever hold that office. He would be 86 at the end of a potential second term. And recent events, including special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report that described the president being portrayed as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and recent Biden missteps where he appeared to confuse long-dead world leaders with their living contemporaries, have served to reinforce those concerns. The White House has pushed back on criticism over Biden\u2019s age by pointing toward his packed travel schedule. In just the last two weeks, the president has traveled to France to commemorate D-Day, back to the United States to comfort a son who just became a convicted felon and then embarked on another transatlantic journey to Italy, where he participated in high-stakes discussions about future US support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. From there he heads straight to California to participate in a star-studded fundraiser. The rest of this month will see Biden preparing for his critical June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, who turned 78 on Friday and is also scrutinized for his age. Biden\u2019s campaign and his family members have said his age and the experience that comes with it are an asset to his role, and not a liability. The campaign has sent first lady Dr. Jill Biden to shore up older voters\u2019 support of the president. \u201cJoe and that other guy are essentially the same age,\u201d the first lady said at an event in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s not be fooled. But what this election is about, it\u2019s about the character of the person leading our country.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is a healthy, wise 81-year-old ready and willing to work for you every day to make our future better,\u201d she added. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t one of the most effective presidents of our lives in spite of his age, but because of it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/media-outlets-use-deceptively-edited-video-to-claim-biden-wandered-off-at-g7-summit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_politics_trump-gag-order-classified-documents-florida", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys on Friday ridiculed special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s gag order request in the former president\u2019s classified documents case in Florida, calling it an unconstitutional attack on the 2024 Republican candidate and a ploy to help Joe Biden keep the presidency. \u201cIn Jack Smith\u2019s most recent shocking display of overreach and disregard for the Constitution, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office asks the Court to enter an unconstitutional gag order as one of the release conditions on the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote in a new filing, repeating their previous arguments against gag orders. The attorneys continued, comparing the request to the gag order Trump is under in a separate case in New York, adding, \u201cLike Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Smith seeks to restrict President Trump\u2019s campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month.\u201d In late May, attorneys for Smith asked the judge presiding to \u201cmake clear\u201d that Trump cannot \u201cmake statements that pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents participating in the investigation and prosecution of this case.\u201d The heart of their concern, prosecutors wrote, was Trump\u2019s \u201cfalse and inflammatory statements\u201d when he claimed that FBI agents were ready to shoot him and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d during the 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. The former president was in New York at the time. Trump\u2019s claims, based on the FBI\u2019s plan for the search \u2013\u00a0which was provided to the defense in discovery \u2013 are entirely false, prosecutors wrote, adding that Trump has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search, as the bureau does with \u201ccountless\u201d warrants that it executes. The FBI and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both said the policy is normal and was also in place during the search of President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware residence during the investigation into his handling of classified information. In the filing Friday, Trump\u2019s attorneys said prosecutors have not submitted \u201cany evidence of threats or harassment resulting from President Trump\u2019s protected speech.\u201d \u201cNot a single FBI agent who participated in the raid submitted an affidavit, or even an argument, claiming that President Trump\u2019s remarks put them at risk,\u201d his attorneys wrote. Prosecutors\u2019 original ask for a gag order was thrown out by Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, who determined that they had not fully conferred with Trump\u2019s attorneys before filing the request. Trump\u2019s false claims \u201cinvite\u201d threats and harassment against law enforcement agents involved in the case, prosecutors wrote, similar to those \u201cthat have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/politics/trump-gag-order-classified-documents-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts", "text": "An unprecedented two weeks of legal drama that yielded historic convictions of a former president and a sitting president\u2019s son have also produced a clear political takeaway. The survival of the rule of law in America and untainted justice may depend on the choice voters make in November. The country\u2019s divergent possible paths under President Joe Biden or presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump were highlighted in the way both men, their families and their political operations reacted to the twin trials and verdicts. Biden made no effort to interfere in the prosecution of his son Hunter with either his executive authority or with the media megaphone of his office. He allowed his own Justice Department to secure a guilty verdict Tuesday that could result in jail time for the recovering addict and hurt his own 2024 campaign. \u201cI will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,\u201d the president said after the jury found his son guilty of lying on a federal background check form and possessing a gun while addicted to, or using, illegal drugs. He has already said he won\u2019t pardon his son. In his first reaction to the verdict, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t attack the judge or prosecutors, simply saying he was grateful for the love and support of his family and blessed to be clean again. The Bidens\u2019 comportment contrasted with Trump\u2019s reaction to his own trial and conviction nearly two weeks ago in his hush money case. The ex-president lashed out at witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and the judge. He claimed that \u201cthis was done by (the) Biden administration in order to wound or hurt a political opponent.\u201d He blasted \u201ca rigged decision,\u201d despite the fact the Justice Department was not involved in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney. Since then, Trump has been warning he\u2019d use presidential powers to punish his political opponents and bend the legal system to his will. \u201cSometimes revenge can be justified,\u201d Trump told TV psychologist Phil McGraw last week. \u201cI have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d The former president told Fox News last week, \u201cI would have every right to go after them,\u201d referring to the Bidens. Two Trump claims discredited by Hunter Biden verdict Throughout his trial in Manhattan, his former hometown, Trump, insisted he couldn\u2019t get a fair verdict in a city that votes mostly Democratic. But Delaware is a blue state \u2014 and a jury there just convicted the president\u2019s son. One juror told CNN Tuesday that politics never came up in the deliberations. Jurors in Trump\u2019s trial have yet to speak, perhaps because of fears they could be identified following the ex-president\u2019s intimidation tactics. Had Biden been acquitted, Republicans would surely have argued that a biased jury in a state where everyone seems to know the first family had proven their point. But the guilty verdict blew another of their political arguments out of the water. Joe Biden came to office pledging to restore the independence of the Justice Department following Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to employ its legal and investigative powers almost as a personal law firm during his term. But the former president has left no doubt that he\u2019d do the same and more if he wins back the White House in November and would ignore the DOJ\u2019s core mission statement of enforcing the law with \u201cindependence and Impartiality.\u201d Trump has already vowed to prosecute Biden and his family and to \u201cobliterate\u201d what he calls the \u201cDeep State.\u201d Several outside groups have drawn up plans to help him. The Hunter Biden verdict also contradicted the central rationale of Trump\u2019s multiple legal defenses in his four criminal cases, several civil matters and his entire presidential campaign. This is the false notion that he is a victim of a weaponized legal system by a Justice Department that exclusively targets Republicans. \u201cSo much for the weaponization of the Justice Department to go after just the enemies of the other side,\u201d Michael Zeldin, a former senior Justice Department official and federal prosecutor, said on CNN Max on Tuesday. \u201cThis is testament to the fact the Justice Department under (Attorney General Merrick) Garland is trying its very best to steer straight down the middle as it should and bring people to trial that it thinks are worthy of prosecution.\u201d The notion of Justice Department neutrality was bolstered by post-trial comments from David Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware whom Garland elevated to  special counsel to avoid the impression of political bias. Weiss thanked the attorney general for allowing him to act independently. And, he added, in a coda to two fraught weeks that have dragged the justice system into toxic political waters, that \u201cno one in this country is above the law. Everyone must be accountable for their actions, even this defendant.\u201d However, Weiss added: \u201cHunter Biden should be no more accountable than any other citizen convicted of this same conduct.\u201d Ken Buck, a former Republican member of Congress, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that Joe Biden had handled the painful matter of his son\u2019s trial and conviction appropriately. \u201c(He did) a great job in trying to stay above the fray and recognizing that his Justice Department was in a very difficult position. People look at this case and realize it was done in an independent and fair way.\u201d Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University history professor and CNN political analyst, said the criminal convictions of Trump and Hunter Biden reflected the huge stakes in November\u2019s election. \u201cNot only is (Joe Biden) saying, the decision is also one that comes from the courts, he\u2019s not saying he\u2019s going to use presidential power to somehow issue a pardon. And you contrast that with the former president who\u2019s attacked the legal system. He\u2019s questioned its legitimacy.\u201d Zelizer added: \u201cVoters will have to make a choice. What kind of response do they want? And what kind of person do they want in the Oval Office come January of 2025?\u201d The idea that the Justice Department is only going after Republicans is not just belied by the Hunter Biden conviction in the gun case and a looming tax trial that awaits him in September. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey is on trial in New York for bribery and corruption. The Justice Department in May indicted another well-known Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, and his wife for allegedly accepting around $600,000 from Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil firm and a Mexican bank in exchange for official acts as a member of Congress. Both Democrats have maintained their innocence. Nevertheless, House Republicans are scheduled to hold a vote on Wednesday on holding Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of President  Biden\u2019s interviews with former special\u00a0counsel Robert Hur. Biden has asserted executive privilege over the files. The truth is unlikely to change the GOP Biden narrative Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin highlighted the contrast between Trump and Biden. \u201cThe Republicans are attacking our entire system of justice and the rule of law because they don\u2019t like the way one case came out. Whereas the son of the president of the United States is prosecuted and I don\u2019t hear a single Democrat crying foul,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. Yet one lesson of the Trump-era is that the truth rarely matters. The revealing of inconvenient facts never penetrates the echo chamber that dominates Republican politics and conservative media. So rather than being chastened by the collapse of the Trump persecution narrative and the successful application of the rule of law in a criminal trial, Trump supporters in Congress merely used the Biden verdict to conjure a new round of falsehoods and conspiracy theories. House Oversight Chairman James Comer said the Delaware trial was \u201ca step toward accountability.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican warned that Justice Department officials were continuing to \u201ccover for the Big Guy, Joe Biden.\u201d Comer repeated accusations that the president had profited from his son\u2019s ethically questionable business operations in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president despite the failure of his committee and the House GOP impeachment probe to find any such evidence. House Speaker Mike Johnson took a similar approach. \u201cWe will continue to demand accountability for the corrupt business dealings of the Biden family,\u201d said the Louisiana Republican, a firm supporter of Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s loss in a recent civil case that found that he, his adult sons and his organization had committed massive insurance and banking fraud. Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s former White House domestic policy adviser, argued that the Justice Department had actually shown favoritism toward Hunter Biden by not charging him with 50 felonies over foreign influence peddling. The department should \u201ctell him his only way out of life in prison is to testify against the BIG GUY,\u201d Miller said on X. Some of the GOP reaction to Biden becoming a convicted felon was bizarre. One of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, baselessly suggested on X that a verdict produced by a jury of his peers was some kind of elaborate plot. \u201cHunter Biden just became the Deep State\u2019s sacrificial lamb to show that Justice is \u2018balanced\u2019 while the other Biden crimes remain ignored,\u201d she wrote on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/hunter-biden-donald-trump-guilty-verdicts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_john-roberts-recording-what-matters", "text": "The funny thing about \u201csecret\u201d recordings made of public figures is that they generally confirm what everyone already knew. The propriety of liberal activist Lauren Windsor pretending to be a religious conservative in order to surreptitiously record Supreme Court justices attending a dinner hosted by the Supreme Court Historical Society can certainly be debated. The effectiveness of publishing these recordings is clear. Putting the word \u201csecret\u201d in a headline about a recording guarantees more people will read it. The implication is that the subject is saying something they shouldn\u2019t, even if they are actually saying exactly what you\u2019d expect. For example: The secret recording of Mitt Romney talking at a fundraiser \u2013 about how the 47% of the population that would oppose him no matter what probably don\u2019t pay income tax \u2013 contributed to his 2012 presidential election loss in part because the comments rang true to the narrative of the campaign. Alito\u2019s comments are no surprise Did we need a secret recording to know that Justice Samuel Alito feels that religious Americans are being persecuted? We did not. It\u2019s written all over his opinions and his public appearances. Did we need a secret recording to know that Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann, would bristle at having to look at Pride flags flown across the lagoon from their New Jersey beach house? Probably not, after she was scrutinized for flying an upside-down American flag \u2013 a distress signal \u2013 at their home in Virginia before Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and a religious-themed \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag in New Jersey. Her German view of revenge against her detractors, which she explains in the recordings, is a new development. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic writes the following about Justice Alito: \u201cOver the years, Alito has demonstrated an us-versus-them attitude on religion, as well as ideological and political matters. He has declared religion under siege and cast himself on the side of the persecuted.\u201d Read more from Biskupic about how the Alito recordings will reinforce growing skepticism of the court and Alito\u2019s objectivity. Roberts said something interesting about the current state of politics Chief Justice John Roberts, who was also recorded, similarly sounded just like his public persona \u2013 carefully choosing words and avoiding controversial statements, such as when he argued that his Jewish and Muslim friends do not view the US as a Christian nation. Where Alito\u2019s aggrieved view of his own persecution inflames partisan divides, Roberts argued, with examples, for a more optimistic view of the current political moment, which he said is not nearly as bad as previous eras in US history. It\u2019s a view that explains how Roberts may see the court\u2019s role in the upcoming election, in which Biden says Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and in which Trump has promised to use victory as a path to retribution. Here are some key quotes from the recording of Roberts: This is indeed a broad historical view. The 1857 Dred Scott decision, which is a blot on the history of the court, ruled that slaves were not citizens of the US and not protected under the Constitution. It came a few years before the Civil War, which was fought over the issue of slavery. During the New Deal, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially remade the US government to handle the Great Depression. He was frequently at odds with the Supreme Court and unsuccessfully tried to pack the court to make it more to his liking. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement and protest movement, along with a series of assassinations and the Vietnam War, tested the nation and the court. Roberts has long felt that one key piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was enacted to protect Black votes in the South, was an improper use of federal power. As chief justice in 2013, he oversaw a key decision that whittled away at the power of the Voting Rights Act, allowing Republicans in Southern states to draw more and more noncompetitive congressional districts that solidify their majorities in those states. Last year, however, Biskupic noted that he seemed to change course and helped uphold part of the Voting Rights Act. This is not the view of someone who sounds particularly concerned that American democracy is in danger. Roberts has also been loath to entertain the concerns of lawmakers. He refused to meet with Democratic senators, for instance, about mounting concerns over gifts Justice Clarence Thomas accepted from a billionaire buddy and after reports of the partisan flag displays at Alito\u2019s home. Democrats have also complained that Roberts has not done more to address the issue of partisan lawyers gaming how to get cases before judges they hope will be friendly. Windsor asked if Roberts believes what\u2019s happening right now is normal. His response: And the Supreme Court has not acted as if anything special is going on. Justices refused to allow Colorado to remove Trump from its primary ballot in a case involving the \u201cinsurrectionist clause.\u201d They denied special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for an expedited review of Trump\u2019s argument that, as a former president, he should enjoy some kind of super immunity from prosecution. Taking their time, the justices may effectively push Trump\u2019s federal criminal trials past Election Day. Windsor worries in the recording that polarization today is \u201cso extreme that it might be irreparable.\u201d In response, Roberts said this: Note: Roberts did not serve in Vietnam,  but he was a young man as American troops were withdrawing in 1973, a year before then-President Richard Nixon resigned as a result of the Watergate scandal. By the end of the decade, Roberts was a young attorney bound for the Ronald Reagan administration. Today, he\u2019s the chief justice exuding calm and acting aloof even as confidence in the branch of government he leads has fallen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/john-roberts-recording-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
