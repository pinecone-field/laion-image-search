Both Egypt and Qatar are very engaged, as are the Israelis.\u201d The latest round of talks comes as the war in Gaza has reached its seventh month, leaving more than 35,000 people dead and thousands of Palestinians in desperate need of food, water and medical aid. The last temporary truce, in November, saw the release of more than 100 hostages, but the Israel Defense Forces estimate that there are still around 130 people being held. Burns has acted as a key interlocutor for the United States in the multiparty talks between Israel, Hamas, Egypt and Qatar, and he has been dispatched during previous rounds of talks, only to see them later collapse. A Qatari official told CNN that Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani will also take part. The prime minister is currently in Paris, the official said. Neither official would confirm the other participants. In the past they have been joined in Paris by Israel\u2019s Mossad Director David Barnea and the head of Egyptian intelligence Abbas Kamel. The talks were paused three weeks ago after Burns crisscrossed the region trying to close the remaining gaps between Israel and Hamas. CNN\u00a0reported Tuesday\u00a0that Egypt muddied the negotiations after independently changing the terms of a framework that Israel had signed on to and presenting it to Hamas who then declared they accepted it. The\u00a0ceasefire agreement\u00a0that Hamas\u00a0ended up\u00a0announcing\u00a0on May 6 was not what the Qataris or the Americans believed had been submitted to Hamas for\u00a0a potential final review, three sources told CNN. The proposal had been changed without the knowledge of Israel or the other mediators, the US and Qatar, prompting anger and frustration. Burns was in the region when word reached him that the Egyptians had changed the terms of the deal. Two days after Hamas\u2019 response on May 6, Burns returned to Washington and sources told CNN the talks were \u201cpaused.\u201d The Qataris are expected to play a bigger role in this round, a source previously told CNN, but Egypt is still expected to be central given their essential proximity to Hamas, as well as Israel\u2019s preference of Egypt to Qatar. The discussions would still be expected to center\u00a0on\u00a0a broad framework that would include an initial stage in which up to 33 Israeli hostages would be released over at least six weeks. Hamas has been pushing to include the bodies of dead hostages in the initial release and also have the first phase flow into a second with no break \u2014\u00a0both positions that Israel has resisted.

{"id": "2024_04_13_politics_questions-trump-trial-answered-what-matters", "text": "When CNN asked for your questions about former President Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial \u2013 for his role in hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women who said they had affairs with him \u2013 we got a flood of input. Not all of it was fit to print. But there were a lot of legitimate and very thoughtful questions, which we\u2019ve updated now that the defense and prosecution have both rested and jurors may begin deliberations as soon as May 28. Keep reading for a representative sampling, which helps explain the case, along with context from CNN\u2019s reporters and coverage. Most of the questions come directly from reader submissions, but for others, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of simplifying multiple submissions into one question. Trump, by the way, denies having the affairs and has pleaded not guilty in the case. I went to CNN\u2019s chief legal analyst Laura Coates for the single, most-asked question, which was asked in many ways but boils down to: Could Trump actually go to jail? Coates: If Trump were to be found guilty of all of the counts, he could theoretically be facing more than a decade in prison.\u00a0The 34 felony counts are classified as Class E felonies in New York, the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty for each of those counts is four years; however New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years.\u00a0It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to decide whether those sentences would run concurrently or consecutively. Because the crimes involve nonviolent offenses and Trump does not have a criminal record, the judge could also consider jailing him for a period that is but a fraction of the maximum penalty. Another possibility is that the judge could forego prison entirely and place him on probation with the possibility of incarceration looming over his head if he fails to abide by the conditions set by the judge. If the judge should decide to incarcerate post-conviction, Secret Service would become the elephant in the, well, cell.\u00a0The unprecedented nature of incarcerating a former president would raise questions about how best to ensure equal treatment under the law and security for a former president. Watch Coates\u2019 show weeknights at 11 p.m. ET where she\u2019ll answer a lot more of your questions. I reached out to the Secret Service to ask if they had planned for the potential that Trump could be imprisoned. Not surprisingly, I was told by a spokesman that this is \u201csomething we can not comment on at this time.\u201d But note that as a matter of US law, former presidents and their spouses are afforded lifetime Secret Service protection, unless they decline it. This is ultimately a question of strategy. But testimony in previous proceedings has not gone well for Weisselberg, the former, longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. He is currently indisposed at Rikers Island, a prison in New York, where he\u2019s serving time for admitting to perjury in the civil fraud trial that ended in a more than $400 million judgement against Trump for inflating his net worth to get friendly loan terms. Prosecutors told Judge Juan Merchan they did not attempt to compel Weisselberg\u2019s testimony in this trial even though he played a crucial role in payments to Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen. Defense lawyers said Weisselberg was not available to either side for testimony and would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if called. Look for jurors to be given instructions about how to view testimony they heard about Weisselberg. There is strong evidence that the campaign was in a state of panic after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in 2016. There is strong evidence from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the desire to help Trump\u2019s campaign by finding and neutralizing damaging stories. It\u2019s clear that Cohen organized payments for Stormy Daniels, a woman who claimed an affair with Trump, and that he took out a loan to make them happen. But Cohen is the only witness who said that Trump specifically made payments to Cohen to reimburse him for the payments to Daniels. Jurors will have to believe Cohen, an admitted liar and felon, that the payments were improper reimbursement and not simply lawyer fees. A unanimous vote is required for either conviction or acquittal. Anything short of a unanimous verdict would be a hung jury. The judge will try very hard to get the jury to reach a unanimous verdict.  A hung jury might be perceived as a net win for Trump since prosecutors would have to ponder whether to try him again on the same charges and there\u2019s little chance it would happen before Election Day. The former first lady has not attended any of her husband\u2019s criminal trial, although many of Trump\u2019s political allies \u2013 senators, House members and more \u2013 have shown their support by attending some of the arguments. Trump\u2019s son with Melania, Barron Trump, graduated from high school in Florida during the trial and the judge canceled arguments that day so that the former president could attend the ceremony. Given that the trial included testimony from Daniels about her alleged affair \u2013 which Trump has denied \u2013 it is perhaps not surprising that Melania Trump would decide not to attend the proceedings. First, Trump never signed a check to Daniels, and that is a major element of the case. Cohen engineered the hush money payment when he could not get the National Enquirer to foot the bill. Cohen took out a line of credit on his apartment to come up with the cash. Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen after Trump won the White House were, according to Cohen, to pay him back for the Daniels payments, plus a bonus, and for other things like a bogus poll Cohen engineered. Second, Trump did claim to give up control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., when he was in the White House. But the arrangement was universally criticized by ethics experts. Trump maintained his ownership stake in the business. Some of his payments to Cohen were made from accounts associated with the trust set up to hold the Trump Organization while Trump was president. Other payments were made from a personal bank account, but all the payments were processed by the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors. Trump isn\u2019t technically accused of having an affair, which he denies and which is not illegal. The hush money itself, represented by a contract between two parties, is not necessarily illegal either. Hush money was paid by the Trump-supporting publisher of the National Enquirer to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and, separately, it was paid by Cohen to Daniels. But in this case, the payments, which were intended to hide details from voters before the 2016 election, violated campaign finance law. National Enquirer\u2019s parent company admitted wrongdoing, and Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign law and served time in prison. Federal prosecutors, as a matter of Department of Justice policy, were unable to prosecute Trump for the payments when he was president and decided not to bring charges after he left office. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg then brought this case. Trump is accused of falsifying business records (a New York state crime) in an effort to use illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 campaign (a federal crime). Yes. This is an important element of the case. Falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor. The felony charge here is falsifying business records to further another crime. And this is where the case against Trump gets unique. The other crime is a campaign finance violation to which Cohen has already pleaded guilty. It is a state crime made a felony by furthering a federal crime. Federal prosecutors, by the way, decided not to pursue charges against Trump with regard to the campaign finance violation. Jurors heard testimony about how nervous Trump\u2019s campaign was after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was published and they desperately wanted to tamp down on any unflattering stories. Trump\u2019s defense is that he did not want the Daniels story to be published because he wanted to keep the information from his wife. Nothing about any of this is normal. Trump\u2019s stated legal strategy is to delay legal proceedings as much as possible in the hope that they do not conclude before the presidential election. It\u2019s a strategy that so far is paying off in federal court. His federal election interference case is stalled until the US Supreme Court rules on what most people consider to be a ridiculous total immunity argument. His federal trial on classified documents is on indefinite hold in Miami. His trial in Fulton County, Georgia, on state election interference allegations has been delayed by allegations of impropriety in the personal life of the DA bringing the case. This is a great and essentially unanswerable hypothetical. First, it assumes multiple things will occur: Trump would have to be convicted, sentenced, exhaust appeals, report to prison and win the election. That\u2019s a very specific scenario thrust upon a very unpredictable set of circumstances and a short timeline. I talked to Frank Bowman, a law professor emeritus at the University of Missouri who is both an expert in criminal law and published a book on the impeachment process, for his thoughts on how to deal with a convict president. The Constitution, he said, theoretically allows a person to serve \u201ceven if he\u2019s a convicted felon or even if he\u2019s a convicted felon in the joint.\u201d Timing, however, would get in the way of this hypothetical ever occurring. \u201cThis stuff takes a long time, and the appeals would drag out,\u201d probably beyond Election Day and Inauguration Day, Bowman said. It\u2019s also possible Trump\u2019s opponents, after a conviction, could try again to either impeach him or object to his presidency based on the 14th Amendment, although those avenues have been tried and failed previously. If somehow Trump was convicted in this state case, Bowman imagined there could be some argument by which the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause \u2013 which prohibits states from interfering in the exercise of constitutional powers \u2013 could be utilized to keep Trump from state prison. But it would be a novel thing. If, on the other hand, Trump was somehow convicted in one of his two federal trials and sentenced to federal prison, as president he could theoretically try to pardon himself or order the Bureau of Prisons to do something like confine him at the White House. Again, this is uncharted territory that is unanticipated in US law and, Bowman argues, unlikely to occur.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

It\u2019s the third time in as many years that a major West Coast city has ousted its DA over apparent concerns about crime. Portland\u2019s vote this week is particularly notable given the unrest in the city following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in the summer of 2020\u00a0and a recent surge in drug overdoses that prompted the declaration of a state of emergency. \u201cIt is looking as if I will not be serving another four years as Multnomah County District Attorney,\u201d Schmidt said in a statement obtained by\u00a0CNN affiliate KOIN.\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0have called Nathan Vasquez to congratulate him on his victory.\u201d While results in Tuesday\u2019s nonpartisan election have not been certified, unofficial results on the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s\u00a0website\u00a0as of 10:00 a.m. ET Friday showed Vasquez ahead of Schmidt, 53.3% to 46.3%. Vasquez, a prosecutor in Multnomah County since 2001, made public safety a key component of his campaign for office. \u201cWe must take lawless behavior seriously and enforce our laws,\u201d his\u00a0campaign platform\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cEven\u00a0\u2018petty\u2019\u00a0crimes, like theft, vandalism, and littering, public use of illicit drugs and public highs, all contribute to the overall feeling of safety and wellbeing of a community.\u201d Vasquez told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that the community in Portland is still very progressive and is not abandoning those values with his election. \u201cReally what they\u2019re looking for, though, is a balance,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThey\u00a0want public safety and they want it delivered in a professional manner. And that\u2019s why I came forward with the experience I have to do that in a way that kind of respects our values in this community, but also makes sure that victims and public safety are our priority.\u201d He also said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u00a0were things that got off track, and I believe the community now is ready for a different vision \u2014 one that involves more public safety, but still has a strong place for progressive values.\u201d As CNN\u00a0has reported, state and local officials declared a fentanyl state of emergency in January for parts of downtown Portland following a surge in overdoses. Last month, Oregon\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek\u00a0signed legislation\u00a0re-criminalizing the possession of certain drugs, roughly three years after the state became the first in the nation to decriminalize the possession and personal use of all drugs. The shakeup in Portland comes as public safety issues have driven prosecutor races in other West Coast cities in recent years. Voters in San Francisco\u00a0recalled District Attorney Chesa Boudin\u00a0in 2022 amid concern that he was advancing progressive policies as a national criminal justice reform advocate at the cost of their safety, and in 2021,\u00a0voters in Seattle\u00a0elected Ann Davison, a Republican, as city attorney over a challenger who had called for abolishing jails and police, CNN affiliate KIRO reported.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_supreme-court-justices-tired-testy-fractured-analysis", "text": "As Supreme Court justices try to resolve more than a dozen major cases over the next month, including whether Donald Trump must stand trial for election subversion, they appear mired in antagonism and distrust. Liberals have been\u00a0bluntly exposing\u00a0their differences with the conservative majority and\u00a0asserting\u00a0that it is changing the law in America simply because, with new justices, it can. Conservatives, who indeed hold the upper hand\u00a0on the 6-3 court, nonetheless spike their writing and remarks with derision for the left. And the court faces an increasingly disapproving public amid a series of self-inflicted controversies over ethics and perceived conflicts of interest \u2013 the latest\u00a0from\u00a0flags flown at homes owned by Justice Samuel Alito that are often associated with Trump supporters and the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. During their last\u00a0two weeks\u00a0of oral arguments,\u00a0the anger among justices on both sides of the bench was obvious to lawyers and others who regularly attend. They sounded testy and looked weary. During the scheduled one-hour hearings that often ran twice as long, several justices held their heads in hands. Alito rolled his eyes. Elena Kagan wore a pained expression. Clarence Thomas rubbed his face.\u00a0In some cases, when Ketanji Brown Jackson, the junior justice, posed her final queries at the end of a clean-up round of questioning, most of the others didn\u2019t look her way. The larger atmosphere suggested many were simply not listening to each other or respecting divergent views \u2013 a pattern bound to make the final sprint of negotiations especially difficult. As a result, it could be harder for Chief Justice John Roberts to win unanimity, or something close to it, in the controversy over Trump\u2019s\u00a0demand for\u00a0immunity. In past challenges to presidential power, whether involving Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton, chief justices have labored toward unanimous rulings. Personal discord can also make the tone of\u00a0their\u00a0written\u00a0opinions harsher all around, as seen in March in the Trump ballot case from Colorado or\u00a0Thursday in a racially charged voting\u00a0case from\u00a0South Carolina. More substantively, these differences can stymie compromise. Concurring opinions and competing rationales, as occurred in last week\u2019s dispute over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,\u00a0when\u00a0five justices split off from the majority in concurring statements,\u00a0are apt to confuse lower court judges and others trying to understand the legal precedent. The justices have already stalled on some controversies heard last fall, even as they are now dealing with the new ones argued this spring, including on abortion access,\u00a0\u201cbump-stock\u201d firearm regulation\u00a0and homeless encampments. The South Carolina racial gerrymandering case handed down on Thursday took more than seven months to resolve, and the 99 pages of\u00a0conflicting\u00a0opinions showed why. As justices poked holes in each other\u2019s legal reasoning, their words dripped with sarcasm.\u00a0\u00a0 Confronting fellow justices in writing The current strife is no doubt exacerbated by the unprecedented ideological split of contemporary times.\u00a0Since the six-justice conservative bloc coalesced in late 2020, it has been driving changes in American life \u2013 including the end of constitutional abortion rights \u2013 and is likely to further transform the law in cases to be issued through the end of June. Conservatives will also control any emergency litigation over ballot rules leading up to the November elections. Liberal justices have been throwing up flares,\u00a0including\u00a0in a Louisiana voting rights case\u00a0earlier this month. When the court majority allowed Louisiana state officials to use a map with a second majority-Black congressional district (over the protest of a GOP-backed group of White voters), the three liberals dissented. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson surely favored the outcome of two majority-Black districts (among Louisiana\u2019s six), after a special US district court had found that the state previously diluted the ability of Blacks\u00a0to elect a candidate of their choice. But the liberals chose to fully separate themselves from the majority\u2019s action, likely because of the majority\u2019s reliance on the so-called Purcell principle that shuts\u00a0down\u00a0litigation as elections approach. (The court, however, has never clarified how close to an election is too close.)\u00a0Liberals\u00a0were perhaps distrustful of how the majority might use that easily manipulated principle in potential lawsuits over discriminatory ballot rules in the heat of an election\u00a0this fall. That Louisiana case recalled liberal justices\u2019 moves in the Colorado\u00a0case\u00a0over whether Trump could be struck from the state ballot because of his role in the riot at the Capitol. In both cases, there was more common ground than differences, but the liberals chose to accentuate the latter\u00a0and were admonished by conservative\u00a0Justice Amy Coney Barrett. \u201cIn my judgment, this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency,\u201d\u00a0Barrett\u00a0wrote in the March\u00a0decision. \u201cThe Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up. \u2026 All nine Justices agree on the outcome of the case. That is the message Americans should take home.\u201d But that was not the message liberals chose to send. True, the\u00a0nine had unanimously concluded that states lack the power to enforce the 14th Amendment\u2019s anti-insurrectionist provision against a candidate for the presidency and other federal offices. But a five-justice conservative bloc went further and said that only specific legislation passed by Congress could activate the provision. In their objection, the\u00a0justices on the left\u00a0turned an earlier adage of Roberts against his majority: \u201cIf it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary\u00a0not\u00a0to decide more.\u201d\u00a0T\ufeffhey\u00a0then quoted a dissenting opinion from the enduringly contentious 2000 case of Bush v. Gore: \u201cWhat it does today, the Court should have left undone.\u201d Thursday\u2019s dispute over a South Carolina congressional map produced another ideologically heated\u00a0series\u00a0of opinions.\u00a0The court by a 6-3 vote kept intact a district that favored Republicans and that challengers said unconstitutionally used race as a proxy for district lines. (A lower US court had\u00a0referred to it as the\u00a0\u201cbleaching of African American voters\u201d from the district.) Dissenting liberals emphasized that the decision reversing the lower court undercut a 2017 Supreme Court ruling, Cooper v. Harris, issued before the far-right majority took hold. \u201c(W)e\u00a0have seen all this once before\u2014except that it was in a dissent,\u201d Kagan wrote, also referring to the \u201cmajority-n\u00e9e-dissent\u2019s reasons.\u201d Alito, who wrote for the majority, dissected dissenters\u2019 criticism, concluding of Kagan\u2019s 35-page statement that went as long as his 35 pages: \u201cDespite its length, the dissent boils down to six main points. None is valid.\u201d Another Alito controversy Alito has been under new scrutiny because of controversial flags flown at his residences in Virginia and New Jersey that suggest sympathy with\u00a0people\u00a0who protested Joe Biden\u2019s election win over Trump in 2020. He has declined to respond to questions about a potential conflict of interest, as the justices are weighing two cases arising from Trump-related \u201cStop the Steal\u201d activities. Shortly after\u00a0the US\u00a0Capitol riot\u00a0on January 6, 2021, an American flag flew upside down at Alito\u2019s house in suburban Virginia. Such inverted flags were widely used by Trump supporters at the time to protest the election results that\u00a0validly\u00a0gave Biden the presidency. Alito said last week he was not involved in flying that flag and and\u00a0that his wife, Martha-Ann, had put it up The New York Times\u00a0this week reported that\u00a0a second flag embraced by January 6 rioters, known as \u201cAppeal to Heaven,\u201d had been spotted at Alito\u2019s vacation home on the Jersey shore. Alito declined requests from CNN for comment on the upside-down and Appeal to Heaven flags. On Thursday, when Alito and the other justices took the bench, it was business as usual, including as Alito tersely read synopses from the two cases he had authored. Nothing in the expressions of the full nine betrayed the latest controversy. Separately, in Kagan\u2019s written dissent in the South Carolina case, she twice described Alito\u2019s approach as \u201cupside-down.\u201d Her opinion was drafted over several months, and it\u2019s impossible to know from the outside when that characterization was added; yet on Thursday, with so much commentary regarding Alito\u2019s upside-down flag still in the air, the phrasing naturally jumped out. Confronting fellow justices using lawyers as foils During the\u00a0recently completed\u00a0oral arguments, as much as the justices directed their questions to the lawyers at the lectern, it was clear they had something to say to each other. Kagan and\u00a0Roberts turned especially confrontational\u00a0in a dispute over a city\u2019s fines for homeless people who camp on public property. At issue during the late April proceedings was whether ticketing of homeless\u00a0persons\u00a0in Grants Pass, Oregon, amounted to \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment under the Eighth Amendment. A lower US appeals court had ruled that the city\u2019s anti-camping ordinances penalized\u00a0people\u00a0for \u201cthe mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements\u201d when they had no alternatives. \u201cFor a homeless person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public,\u201d Kagan said,\u00a0addressing\u00a0the city\u2019s lawyer, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth \u2026 if you were to come in here and you were to say, we need certain protections to keep our streets safe and we can\u2019t have people sleeping anyplace that they want and we can\u2019t have tent cities cropping up, I mean, that would create one set of issues.\u201d \u201cBut your ordinance goes way beyond that. Your ordinance says as to a person \u2026 who has no other place to sleep \u2026 that person \u2026 can\u2019t take a blanket and sleep someplace without it being a crime.\u201d Kagan repeatedly rebuked the lawyer for evading her questioning. Roberts tried to undercut Kagan\u2019s line of inquiry focused on sleeping as a human need, as he questioned a separate lawyer, Edwin Kneedler, from the US Justice Department. \u201cEating is a basic human function as well that people have to do, just like sleeping,\u201d Roberts said, questioning whether someone who broke into a store to\u00a0find\u00a0something to eat could be spared prosecution. Kneedler said that person would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be subject to prosecution because \u201cbreaking into a store is a common crime that not everybody engages in, unlike sleeping, which is what we have here.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s a necessity for the person who needs food,\u201d Roberts continued. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting the hypothetical. I\u2019m saying this person needs food.\u201d Later in that April week, when Idaho state lawyer Joshua Turner stood to defend its abortion ban against a Biden administration policy that would\u00a0ensure emergency abortion care, the three liberal justices\u00a0immediately\u00a0fired a series of questions at him.\u00a0They assailed his\u00a0justifications and\u00a0drew\u00a0out the consequences for pregnant women in dire medical situations. Jackson, Kagan and Sotomayor were not fully in harmony, however; each stepped on Turner\u2019s answers as he was addressing\u00a0the others\u2019\u00a0questions. \u201cWhat you are saying,\u201d Sotomayor told Turner at one point, \u201cis that there is no federal law on the book that prohibits any state from saying, even if a woman will die, you can\u2019t perform an abortion.\u201d The Idaho state attorney objected to that stark conclusion and insisted all states\u00a0provide \u201clife-saving exceptions.\u201d Sotomayor persisted saying his theory would\u00a0lead\u00a0to the worst-case outcome for women in serious medical situations. Turner again tried to counter her conclusion, but Sotomayor interrupted again. Roberts, exasperated, cut off Sotomayor, and said to Turner, \u201cCould I hear your answer?\u201d That provided a momentary breather, but Jackson quickly interjected and justices, liberal and conservative, were firing again. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Alito complained to Turner, \u201cI think you\u2019ve hardly been given an opportunity to answer some of the hypotheticals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/supreme-court-justices-tired-testy-fractured-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_trump-haley-not-speaking", "text": "Despite the public thawing in their rivalry this week, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley still have yet to speak, two sources close to the former president told CNN, continuing a stalemate that has lasted since their race ended. The lack of formal communication is illustrative of the deep rift that emerged from the Republican presidential primary contest and the ongoing divide over who must be first to mend fences. One source familiar with the former president\u2019s thinking told CNN that \u201ctheir relationship remains chilled\u201d in the aftermath of their hard-fought race. Haley on Wednesday appeared to take the first step toward a reconciliation. In a highly anticipated speech in Washington, DC, the former South Carolina governor said she will vote for Trump \u2014 her first public remarks on the former president since dropping out of the race in March. Haley said Trump \u201chas not been perfect\u201d on policies important to her, including foreign policy, immigration and the economy, but President Joe Biden \u201chas been a catastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under the former president. Still, she stopped short of offering an endorsement, just as she did when she ended her campaign. Trump on Thursday welcomed Haley\u2019s support, but declined to elaborate on what role she could play in helping the Republican ticket this November. \u201cI think she\u2019s gonna be on our team, because we have a lot of the same ideas, the same thoughts,\u201d Trump said in an interview with News12 at his rally in the Bronx. \u201cI appreciated what she said, you know, we had a nasty campaign. It was pretty nasty, but she\u2019s a very capable person, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to be on our team in some form. Absolutely.\u201d Many Republicans would like to see Haley play an active role in the Trump campaign, including as a potential vice presidential candidate. South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman told CNN he had pitched the idea to both Trump and Haley and argued to the former president that Haley can carry moderates and independents, given how she continues to draw voters in primaries after exiting the race in March. Trump all but squashed that idea on Truth Social, posting,\u00a0\u201cNikki Haley is not under consideration for the V.P. slot, but I wish her well!\u201d Haley emerged from the 2024 Republican primary as the former president\u2019s last-standing opponent. In her farewell address in Charleston, Haley congratulated Trump and wished him well but added that it was up to him \u201cto earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him.\u201d \u201cAnd I hope he does that,\u201d she said. Within Haley\u2019s orbit, few see evidence Trump has made any such outreach. Meanwhile, Haley continues to win a significant share of the vote in primary contests long after she dropped out of the race, including 17% of the vote last month in Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground. She also won about 22% of the vote in Indiana\u2019s primary earlier this month, a surprising result in a traditionally red state. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s team remains adamant that it\u2019s up to Haley to initiate a detente, just as other Republican challengers have done. \u201cWhen you lose the battle or the war, you generally have to make the outreach, and that\u2019s just the nature of the campaign business,\u201d a Trump adviser previously told CNN. This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/trump-haley-not-speaking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_donald-trump-libertarian-party-rfk", "text": "Former President Donald Trump will address the Libertarian Party\u2019s convention Saturday, an unconventional stop for a presumptive Republican nominee but also illustrative of his campaign\u2019s intensifying concern over third-party candidates. Trump is expected to deliver a pitch to Libertarians focused on their shared grievances over President Joe Biden\u2019s four years in Washington, an event organizer told CNN. His team has also closely watched the results of an informal poll that asked convention attendees which topics Trump should touch on during his remarks. The outreach to Libertarians follows weeks of stepped-up attacks by Trump aimed at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose high-profile independent White House bid is increasingly viewed by the former president\u2019s advisers as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy addressed the convention Friday as the two directly compete for voters disenchanted by the two-party system. In a speech last weekend to the National Rifle Association, Trump described Kennedy\u2019s political views as \u201cradical left\u201d and warned his supporters, \u201cWe can\u2019t waste any more votes.\u201d In a candid moment, Trump also shared the purpose behind his unusual visit to the Libertarian Party. \u201cWe have to join with (Libertarians) because they get their 3% every year, no matter who\u2019s running,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand we have to get that 3% because we can\u2019t take a chance on Joe Biden winning.\u201d Eight years ago, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson earned more than 3% of the popular vote \u2013 a high point in the party\u2019s history. The number of votes Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein and other third-party contenders earned was larger than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in a handful of closely contested battlegrounds. While Trump\u2019s campaign has downplayed Kennedy\u2019s potential to alter the outcome of the race \u2013\u00a0one adviser called him \u201ca problem, not a threat\u201d \u2013 it is not a risk the former president\u2019s team is willing to write off either. Johnson, a former GOP governor of New Mexico, told CNN that any third-party concerns by Trump or Biden would be misguided. \u201cIf there were no third-party candidates, 50% of their vote would go to Biden, 50% would go to Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd a bunch would stay home.\u201d An unusual invitation and a PR boon The decision to host Trump and Kennedy has brought outsize media attention to the Libertarian Party at a time when it has struggled to maintain its relevance. Four years after Johnson\u2019s historic finish, the party\u2019s candidate earned fewer than 2 million votes and wasn\u2019t a factor in Biden\u2019s victory. Convention organizers believe Trump\u2019s speech marks the first time in the modern political era that a presumptive Republican or Democratic nominee will speak at a third-party convention. Trump appeared eager for the audience. His campaign accepted the invite within 48 hours of the offer, said Angela McArdle, chairwoman of the Libertarian Party. Biden was also asked to speak but didn\u2019t respond. Kennedy has challenged Trump to debate him at the convention, a request that has gone unanswered. \u201cI\u2019ve come pretty close to having a major presidential debate at our national convention,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose. If we don\u2019t get to be in a debate, we\u2019re going to get as close as possible. \u201cWe don\u2019t get the coverage Donald Trump and Joe Biden get. It\u2019s an uphill battle. So this has been a real PR boost.\u201d Still, McArdle and other Libertarian members are skeptical that convention attendees can be seriously moved by Trump\u2019s overtures. \u201cThese are people who spent thousands of dollars and devoted hundreds of hours to be here in support of their Libertarian candidates,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cNo one is worried about them flipping.\u201d Wendy Hamlin traveled from St. Augustine, Florida, to attend the Washington, DC, convention. The 43-year-old joined the Libertarian Party in 2008, and while she said Trump\u2019s appearance marks a \u201chistorical moment\u201d for the party, neither she nor any Libertarian she knows is planning to back him. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see him speak,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone excited to see him because they plan to vote for him.\u201d The test for Trump is not necessarily to convert die-hard Libertarians. Rather, his team hopes to convince independent-minded voters who are considering a third-party candidate out of dissatisfaction with the Democratic and Republican nominees or to push back against the status quo. Phil Anderson, a Libertarian running for Senate in the closely watched battleground of Wisconsin, said he\u2019s seen no evidence of the Trump campaign reaching out to Libertarian-leaning voters in his state. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening in Wisconsin because I know all the Libertarians here in one way or another,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing or hearing evidence of that.\u201d Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said the campaign has \u201calready demonstrated effective and solid organizational strength as seen in the historic quickness and size of our primary wins and the historic polling numbers in the general.\u201d \u201cWe are reaching out to Libertarians, Republicans, independents and everyone in between,\u201d Hughes said. Trump is waging a similar \u2013 and more urgent \u2013 battle to convert Kennedy-curious voters. Kennedy\u2019s support in national surveys has reached double digits \u2013 at 16% in a CNN poll conducted last month by SSRS \u2013 with strong indications that he is siphoning support from both Trump and Biden. As the threat has crystalized, so have Trump\u2019s attacks on Kennedy. The former president now regularly attacks Kennedy in public remarks and on social media. Earlier this month, Trump released a lengthy video that labeled Kennedy a \u201cDemocrat plant.\u201d Trump last weekend touched on some kinship between Libertarians and Republicans that could make for a sensible alliance. Libertarians align with conservatives \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 over a desire for a more limited federal government, lower taxes and less spending but often disagree with Republicans on LGBTQ rights and marijuana policy. \u201cThey are also people of common sense, generally speaking,\u201d Trump said, though he added that Libertarians \u201chave a couple of things that are a little different.\u201d Johnson doesn\u2019t see much overlap between his party and modern Republicans, including Trump. He cited the massive growth in the national debt and government spending under Trump and the Covid-19 lockdown measures of 2020. \u201cBottom line, I didn\u2019t vote for Ronald Reagan the second time because he just blew the lid off the deficit. And that\u2019s Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are going to be some things that he has says that the crowd will be receptive to, but there are a lot of things that just don\u2019t fit.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s little overlap between Trump\u2019s agenda and the topics convention attendees indicated are a priority in the party\u2019s poll. The top choices included elimination of the federal income tax, ending the Federal Reserve and freeing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The poll is not scientific but was open only to convention attendees and party members who paid\u00a0$10 to participate. The Trump campaign is aware the former president may receive an unfriendly reception from some attendees Saturday night but is arguing such a reaction is a byproduct of being \u201con offense and competing for nontraditional votes.\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN, \u201cDo we know that it\u2019s not exactly home base? Absolutely. There will be people who want him to be there and people who don\u2019t want him to be there, but we\u2019re on offense and competing for nontraditional votes in order to unite the country.\u201d Trump ally and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was loudly booed Friday when he mentioned Trump during his speech to the convention. The reaction suggests when Trump takes the stage Saturday night, he will be speaking to a crowd far different from the kind he is used to addressing at his rallies, which are full of adoring fans who wait in line for hours to see him D\u2019Anne Welch, 73, has supported Libertarians since 1990, but she\u2019s worried about the party\u2019s embrace of Trump. She\u2019s considering voting for Biden to keep Trump from winning in November. She and her friends, a group of like-minded Libertarians from Texas, brought noisemakers to Washington in hopes of disrupting Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cHe never should\u2019ve been invited,\u201d Welch said. Competition for Libertarian votes Trump is not alone in courting potential Libertarian voters. Though Kennedy has ruled out the possibility of running on the Libertarian ticket, he has courted party officials dating to before he left the Democratic primary last fall to run as an independent. He met with McArdle in July in Tennessee, where the two discussed shared beliefs, including opposition to vaccine mandates and public health restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy and McArdle met again privately following his appearance at the California Libertarian Party\u2019s state convention in February. The Libertarian ticket was seen as a possible pathway for Kennedy to circumvent ballot access hurdles and take advantage of the party\u2019s access to ballots in dozens of states. Kennedy is on the ballot in six states so far, compared with 38 states for the Libertarians. In his remarks at the California convention, Kennedy argued for the benefits of environmental protection while railing against social media censorship and the \u201ctotalitarian control\u201d exerted by government during the Covid-19 pandemic. He did not mention Trump by name. Yet his appearance at the California convention did little to help him gain traction with party members. In an unofficial straw poll of 95 delegates taken at the convention, Kennedy received just one vote. In April, he told ABC News he had ruled out running on the Libertarian ticket. In recent weeks, Kennedy has ramped up his attacks on Trump, including on his handling of the pandemic. Last weekend, Kennedy\u2019s campaign began selling shirts on its website that read \u201cVote Trump/Fauci 2024\u201d along with the slogan \u201cGive us another shot!,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s prominent role in the Trump administration\u2019s Covid-19 response. Kennedy, a staunch anti-war advocate who has said he opposes sending US aid to assist Ukraine\u2019s war effort, has also accused Trump of backing additional aid to Ukraine. \u201c(Trump) gave a big bear hug to Speaker (Mike) Johnson and President Biden and they agreed to send $64 billion more over to Ukraine. Wouldn\u2019t you rather that 64 billion be spent here in the United States?\u201d Kennedy told supporters during a rally in Austin, Texas, earlier this month. Following a campaign rally in Colorado on Sunday, Kennedy told CNN he thinks Libertarians will agree with his views on the environment, foreign policy and Covid-19. \u201cI think a lot of my philosophy and my approach, particularly environmental issues over the many years, my approach is a free-market approach, which appeals to Libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against war, which I think is another important issue for Libertarians. I support constitutional rights. President Trump dismantled our constitutional rights during Covid. So I think Libertarians are probably more inclined to support me if they follow their philosophies.\u201d During his remarks at the convention on Friday, Kennedy issued sharp criticisms of Trump and Biden, but put particular focus on attacking Trump, who he blamed for enacting public health restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWith the lockdowns, the mask mandates, the travel restrictions, President Trump presided over the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known,\u201d Kennedy said. Marcus Schuff, a 42-year-old from Temecula, California, said he\u2019s likely going to vote Libertarian in 2024, depending on who wins the presidential nomination this weekend. But if not, he said he\u2019d be most likely to support Kennedy over any other candidate, including Trump. He doesn\u2019t approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic or his foreign policy record. \u201cThe way Trump behaved during the Covid lockdowns, you know, he shut down international trade. He didn\u2019t do anything to keep things open when certain governors of certain states were shutting things down. And his foreign policy wasn\u2019t great either. I don\u2019t think we should be assassinating Iranian generals in Iraq,\u201d Schuff said, referring to the 2020 drone strike ordered by Trump that killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think many Libertarians are going to be swayed by Trump,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_sotomayor-crying-supreme-court-decisions", "text": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the most senior liberal on the conservative Supreme Court, told an audience at Harvard University on Friday that she sometimes cries after the court hands down its decisions \u2013 and she suggested there may be more tears ahead. \u201cThere are days that I\u2019ve come to my office after an announcement of a case and closed my door and cried,\u201d Sotomayor told the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, where she received an award Friday. \u201cThere have been those days. And there are likely to be more.\u201d Sotomayor made the remarks as the Supreme Court turns toward the final weeks of a term in which the justices will decide a number of high-profile controversies, including former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from\u00a0federal election subversion charges\u00a0and two major cases dealing with abortion. The court is set to hand down those decisions and dozens of others by the end of June. Sotomayor did not discuss specific cases in her remarks. Sotomayor has previously discussed her \u201cfrustration\u201d with the court\u2019s direction. Speaking at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law\u00a0earlier this year, she said she lived with that frustration and that \u201cevery loss truly traumatizes me in my stomach and in my heart.\u201d \u201cBut I have to get up the next morning and keep on fighting,\u201d she said. But her remarks, while generally upbeat, were also more poignant on Friday. \u201cThere are moments when I\u2019m deeply, deeply sad,\u201d she said at Harvard. \u201cAnd there are moments when, yes, even I feel desperation. We all do. But you have to own it. You have to accept it. You have to shed the tears,\u00a0and then you have to wipe them and get up and fight some more.\u201d As often happens this time of year, most of the opinions the court has issued have been unanimous \u2013 or have split along non-ideological lines. But that is partly because the court tends to handle less controversial issues first and deal with the most politically or legally fraught opinions at the end of June. In recent terms, the court has issued\u00a0several\u00a0landmark decisions that have broken along ideological \u2013 or near ideological \u2013 lines, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, a decision that same year that expanded gun rights and a ruling last year that\u00a0gutted affirmative action policies in college admissions. Earlier this week, Sotomayor joined a sharply worded\u00a0dissent\u00a0authored by Justice Elena Kagan in a\u00a0major redistricting case. The court upheld a pro-Republican congressional map in South Carolina and rejected an argument from civil rights groups and a lower court that lawmakers impermissibly used race as a proxy to bolster the GOP\u2019s chances. The decision was 6-3 along conservative-liberal lines.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/sotomayor-crying-supreme-court-decisions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_ted-cruz-2024-election-cnntv", "text": "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz refused on Wednesday to say whether he will unconditionally accept the results of the 2024 election, the latest in a series of comments by prominent Republicans that seek to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the upcoming presidential contest. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually a ridiculous question,\u201d replied Cruz when asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source\u201d whether he will accept the results of the 2024 election regardless of who wins. \u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim. Like, we have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz, who objected to Arizona\u2019s election results on January 6, 2021, then went on in his interview with Collins to suggest, baselessly, that the 2020 election was rife with fraud. \u201cSo my question for you again, free and fair election, will you accept the results regardless of who wins?\u201d Collins asked. \u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz responded. Many prominent Republicans, starting with the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, are already casting doubt on the results in November. Trump said earlier this month that\u00a0he would only accept\u00a0the 2024 election results\u00a0\u201cif everything\u2019s honest.\u201d Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, both considered potential Trump running mates, both said they\u00a0would not have certified\u00a0the 2020 election results had they been Trump\u2019s vice president, while South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott has\u00a0refused to say\u00a0whether he would have certified the results as vice president. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, whom Trump\u00a0mentioned\u00a0as a possible running mate on Thursday, said on CNN the same night, \u201cI will accept the results if it\u2019s done in a fair and transparent way.\u201d Carson also raised doubts about widespread mail-in voting on \u201cLaura Coates Live.\u201d Also on CNN Thursday night, GOP Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who has also been mentioned as a possible Trump vice presidential contender, was asked if he\u2019d accept the results if Trump loses. \u201cIf the states and localities actually follow the rules and procedures and everybody sees the rules followed, then of course, you accept what\u2019s done,\u201d Donalds told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip. On Wednesday, Cruz also defended conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who has been scrutinized over conspicuous flag displays at two of his homes in recent years, telling Collins, \u201cthis entire\u00a0hoopla is greatly overstated.\u201d \u201cI think there is a concerted effort that is driven by Democrats in the Senate to try to delegitimize the court and to try to demonize. We\u2019re seeing it with Justice Clarence Thomas. We\u2019re seeing it with Justice Sam\u00a0Alito. I think the whole thing is disgraceful,\u201d Cruz said. Cruz reiterated Alito\u2019s explanation that Alito\u2019s wife hoisted the symbol of discontent in response to profane signs in the neighborhood, including a neighbor posting a sign saying\u00a0\u201cF**k\u00a0Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Martha-Ann Alito. \u201cListen, there are justices I disagree with, and yet, you should treat everyone with civility and respect, and what Justice Alito said is, his wife was upset,\u201d Cruz said.

The flag was no longer displayed when the reporter, Robert Barnes, visited the justice\u2019s house in Alexandria, Virginia, on the day of President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration to follow up on a related tip, the report said. Martha-Ann Alito demanded the reporter\u00a0\u201cget\u00a0off my property\u201d as he came across the couple leaving their home, The Post said. According to The Post, Martha-Ann Alito yelled,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0an international signal of distress!\u201d as Barnes sought information on the matter before the justice led his wife to a car while denying the flag was related to political protest and saying it stemmed from a neighborhood dispute. Martha-Ann Alito then shouted: \u201cAsk them what they did!\u201d in apparent reference to the Alitos\u2019 neighbors, before retrieving a novelty flag from the couple\u2019s home and yelling,\u00a0\u201cThere!\u00a0Is that better?\u201d after placing it on the flagpole, according to The Post. A spokeswoman for The Post said in the article that the newspaper didn\u2019t report on the interaction at the time\u00a0\u201cbecause\u00a0the flag-raising appeared to be the work of Martha-Ann Alito, rather than the justice, and connected to a dispute with her neighbors\u201d and that it was unclear it was rooted in politics. The Post\u2019s reporting comes as the conservative justice has become embroiled in controversy over displays outside his properties. The New York Times last week\u00a0published a photograph\u00a0of the inverted American flag raised at the Alitos\u2019 home in Virginia in 2021. Alito said the upside-down US flag\u00a0was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors. The dispute involved a neighbor who posted a sign saying\u00a0\u201cF**k\u00a0Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Alito said. The justice\u00a0told Fox News the Alitos got into an argument with the neighbor, who used the term\u00a0\u201cc**t\u201d\u00a0at one point. His wife then flew the inverted flag. The upside-down flag was a symbol for former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The Times then reported Wednesday that a flag that was on display during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was seen flying outside the Alitos\u2019 vacation home in New Jersey last summer.\u00a0The\u00a0\u201cAppeal\u00a0to Heaven\u201d flag, which dates to the Revolutionary War, has become a symbol for supporters of Trump. The revelations about the flags have drawn criticism in Washington, including from\u00a0key GOP senators and from Democrats, who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Senate Republican Whip John Thune, one of the contenders vying to replace retiring Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, told CNN the flag was a \u201cbad decision.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you explain that,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said. The news has also reenergized calls on the left for Congress to enact ethics rules for the Supreme Court, an effort has been stalled for months. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, who has been a frequent critic of conservative justices, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Thursday that it\u00a0\u201craises\u00a0a serious question\u201d for someone on the nation\u2019s highest court to fly such flags at his properties. Some Republican lawmakers have defended Alito, with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas telling CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday that the\u00a0\u201centire\u00a0hoopla is greatly overstated\u201d and accusing Senate Democrats of trying to delegitimize the court.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_democrats-tight-races-border-bill-past-opposition", "text": "Democrats were roundly united against former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. But as the situation at the border has worsened under President Joe Biden, many Democrats have come to embrace some of the very policies they once opposed. That was on display Thursday in the Senate, when a number of Democrats in tight re-election races voted for a bipartisan border bill that would\u2019ve made it easier for the federal government to bar asylum seekers from entering the country, and included money to fund miles of new border wall. Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jacky Rosen of Nevada both strongly opposed a measure known as Title 42 that was initiated under Trump  during Covid-19 allowing officials to turn away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. Brown and Rosen were among 34 Democratic senators who signed onto an open letter in 2020 criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s asylum policies, even likening them to denying safe passage to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust in World War II. But under Biden, Brown later supported extending Title 42 before it expired in May 2023. While Rosen did not advocate for its extension, she warned that the Biden administration was underprepared for an influx of migrants when Title 42 expired. While Democrats mostly say their position has always been to support bipartisan solutions to the border crisis, their vote comes as immigration has surged to the top of voter priorities, reflecting the shifting politics around immigration and the border under Biden. Monthly apprehensions of migrants crossing into the US from Mexico have surged under Biden, topping out at nearly 250,000 in December 2023, up from 90,760 apprehensions from December 2021, according to government data. A Rosen campaign spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that Rosen has \u201cconsistently fought for commonsense and bipartisan reforms to secure the border, fix our broken immigration system and keep our communities safe.\u201d A spokesperson for Brown said that he, too, supported an opportunity for bipartisan reform at the border, and pointed to comments Brown made in May 2023: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can get something comprehensive now, under the pressure of what\u2019s happening at the border,\u201d referring to his support for extending Title 42, adding, \u201cwe need to send more resources to the border\u201d and needed more time to \u201cget this right.\u201d The decision by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to hold a second vote on the bipartisan border security bill was widely seen as a political exercise designed to force Republican senators to vote again on a measure they\u2019d already killed in February, at the behest of Trump. But it also gave some Democrats in competitive races a chance to support a tough immigration bill. Brown and Rosen both face competitive reelection campaigns in Ohio and Nevada. So does Sen. Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat who also voted to support the border bill on Thursday. Tester was on the record opposing a wall long before Trump became a political figure. While running for the Senate in 2006, amidst a different immigration crisis, Tester said during a debate, \u201cIt\u2019s not secure in the least \u2026 But in the end, if we\u2019re focused on this \u2013 I am not in favor of by the way building a fence or a wall or anything else like that.\u201d At one point during the Trump administration, Tester acknowledged that \u201cthere are some places where a wall does make sense.\u201d But Tester also has a history of mocking the wall as \u201cineffective and wasteful\u201d and as a \u201cMedieval border wall\u201d that was not technologically advanced.\u00a0In January 2019, Tester spoke out against Trump\u2019s border wall along the entire US-Mexico border, saying, \u201cI will tell you unequivocally, a wall from sea to shining sea is not the right direction to go.\u201d Tester\u2019s campaign pointed to 14 votes he cast since 2007 to secure funding for border fences, barriers and walls. Recently, Tester\u2019s campaign used prominent images of the border wall in an ad to illustrate his commitment to \u201csecuring the border.\u201d A Tester campaign spokesperson told CNN, \u201cSenator Tester has been a vocal and consistent supporter of border security and Montana\u2019s brave law enforcement officers since the beginning of his time in office\u2014including voting for border wall funding and opposing President Biden\u2019s border policies.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 tonal shift on immigration and the border is also reflected by what wasn\u2019t in the bill, specifically a pathway to citizenship. It is the first major piece of immigration legislation supported by Democrats in more than a decade that doesn\u2019t include provisions for undocumented immigrants. Democrats including Brown and Rosen, as well as Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who is running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, have all previously said that comprehensive immigration reform should include a pathway to citizenship, repeatedly introducing legislation to codify protections. Allred acknowledged that the bill doesn\u2019t have a pathway to citizenship but called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. He is a co-sponsor on the Dignity Act, a bipartisan bill that offers a blueprint for the undocumented to gain legal status. In 2022, Rosen called on Congress to pass a standalone immigration bill for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known colloquially as Dreamers. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Congress, routinely criticized the border wall while first running for Congress in 2018. Over the next few years, he refered to Trump\u2019s border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed. In 2019, Allred said that physical barriers were needed in some places and were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Allred\u2019s campaign pointed CNN to his support for a 2019 appropriations package to avert a government shutdown that offered $1.375 billion in funding for parts of the wall and physical barriers. Allred did not vote for the bill, as he was on paternity leave at the time, but later submitted to the record that he would have voted for it. In October 2023, Allred praised the Biden administration\u2019s construction of new sections of the Trump border wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d Allred told The Hill.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve always said that limited physical barriers have a role to play in a comprehensive approach to securing our border,\u201d said Allred in February 2024 at a Zoom event hosted by The Houston Chronicle. \u201cI have never supported the idea of, you know, a wall across the entire southern border. I think that\u2019s just a waste of money and it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d In a statement, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said, \u201cThroughout his entire time in Congress, Congressman Allred has been steadfast on the need for border security as part of comprehensive immigration reform. Unlike [Texas\u2019 junior US Senator] Ted Cruz, he is willing to work with both parties to actually get something done and secure the border.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/democrats-tight-races-border-bill-past-opposition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is presiding over the sprawling racketeering case, ruled in March that six charges in the 41-count indictment related to\u00a0Trump and\u00a0some\u00a0co-defendants\u00a0allegedly soliciting\u00a0the violation of oath by a public officer lacked the required detail about what underlying crime the defendants were soliciting. The move from Willis comes after an appeals court said it will consider whether she should be disqualified from prosecuting the case after McAfee said she could remain on the case.

Steve Sadow, an attorney for Trump in Georgia, called the filing \u201cnot unexpected.\u201d The former president was named in three of the dismissed counts, but McAfee\u2019s ruling left most of the indictment against Trump and his co-defendants in tact. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and he and his co-defendants are pushing for Willis to be disqualified from the case. The Georgia Court of Appeals said earlier this month that it would consider the challenge to McAfee\u2019s ruling, which allowed Willis to remain on the case if she removed the special prosecutor with whom she had engaged in a romantic relationship.

{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

I share the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. For these reasons, I am planning to vote for change and support Donald Trump for President. In addition, I will be supporting Republican Senate candidates and other Republicans up and down the ticket.\u201d The move represents a decided shift for Schwarzman, the CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone, who made comments critical of Trump in the wake of the 2020 election and suggested in 2022 that the Republican Party needed to seek a \u201cnew generation\u201d of leaders. But that new crop of leaders did not materialize. Schwarzman declined to back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in May 2023 after a meeting with the Republican presidential hopeful left Schwarzman uninspired. Schwarzman supported Trump in the 2016 election and became a trusted adviser once Trump took office. The private equity mogul chaired a prominent business advisory council that weighed in on economic and trade issues and projected a public image of support from corporate America. But the group disbanded after Trump said that a violent Charlottesville white nationalist rally had good people \u201con both sides.\u201d \u201cBigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,\u201d Schwarzman said at the time.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_kansas-city-chiefs-white-house-visit", "text": "The White House announced Friday that President Joe Biden will welcome the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs to the White House on May 31 \u2013 but it seems unlikely that football\u2019s most famous fan will be in attendance. It\u2019ll be the second visit in as many years for the Chiefs, who are celebrating the first back-to-back Super Bowl championships in two decades. The visit caps off a particularly high-profile season for the Chiefs after pop superstar Taylor Swift and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce went public with their relationship early in the season. But, it\u2019s unlikely that Swift will be visiting the White House with Kelce \u2013 she\u2019s touring Europe as part of the foreign leg of her\u00a0record-breaking\u00a0\u201cEras Tour\u201d and will be playing a show in Madrid the night before the visit before traveling on to Lyon, France, later in the weekend. Spe aking to reporters following last year\u2019s visit, quarterback Patrick Mahomes called the trip to the White House \u201csurreal.\u201d \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been to Washington, DC. I\u2019ve never even got to see from the outside, seeing the\u00a0White\u00a0House\u00a0or any of the monuments or memorials,\u201d\u00a0Mahomes\u00a0told reporters. \u201cAnd so, to be able to be here and see that, and see the history of this great nation that we have \u2013 it was really cool for me to just be here and be in the moment, and I don\u2019t think I could ever really imagine it being as cool as it was.\u201d The visit could have some underlying tension after Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker criticized Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2013 an apparent reference to transgender rights. His commencement speech at\u00a0Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas, drew criticism, particularly for a portion in which he said that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d Butker said during the speech. \u201cHow many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world,\u201d he said. Butker\u00a0also praised his wife Isabelle, saying she \u201cwould be the first to say her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.\u201d Asked earlier this week whether Butker would visit the White House with the team, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told reporters, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he will, yeah.\u201d Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to weigh in on the delicate situation when asked during a press briefing last week if the White House expected Butker to attend the festivities. \u201cHonestly, what I can say is we invite the entire team and we do that always. I don\u2019t have anything beyond that,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe invite the team, it\u2019s an invitation that goes to the team, and so it\u2019s up to the team who comes and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d Mahomes defended Butker\u00a0on Wednesday, telling reporters that\u00a0Butker\u00a0is a \u201cgood person,\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him by that. I judge him by the way he acts every single day. I\u2019m not going to get into the full details of the entire\u00a0speech,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cAt the same time, I know what type of person he is and I\u2019m going to make sure I look at that first and let the other stuff handle itself.\u201d Reid said he talks to\u00a0Butker\u00a0\u201call the time\u201d but did not address the\u00a0speech\u00a0with him. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of life here,\u201d Reid said. \u201cEverybody is from different areas, different religions, different races and we all get along. We all respect each other\u2019s opinions, and not necessarily do we go by those but we respect everybody to have a voice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing about America and we\u2019re just, like I said, a microcosm of that,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy wish is that everybody could follow that. \u2026 I don\u2019t think he was speaking ill to women. He has his opinions, and we all respect that. I let you guys in this room, and you have a lot of opinions that I don\u2019t like.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jacob Lev and A.J.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_rnc-secret-service-convention-security", "text": "A dispute over security at the Republican Party\u2019s upcoming Milwaukee convention continued to escalate on Thursday, with the GOP accusing the US Secret Service of ignoring its concerns and the agency claiming the party was undermining efforts to keep the July event safe. The Republican National Committee has been at odds with the city of Milwaukee and the Secret Service over where to place protesters outside the convention. The party has pushed to move protesters to a designated area several streets away from the pathway of convention delegates and other attendees. In a letter dated Thursday, a lawyer for the RNC blasted Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, insisting the security environment around the July convention was \u201crapidly deteriorating\u201d and demanding she force the city to move the First Amendment Zone where protesters can congregate. \u201cRather than dissipating, the overall security climate has worsened significantly over the past month of the USSS\u2019s inaction,\u201d RNC counsel Todd Steggerda wrote, adding that Cheatle\u2019s \u201cfailure to act now to prevent these unnecessary and certain risks will imperil tens of thousands of convention attendees.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Secret Service Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said the service \u201cis confident in the security plan being developed, and will continue to focus on working with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure a safe and secure event.\u201d Moreover, Guglielmi said Steggerda had endangered the event by sharing details of the security plan. The letter included maps of the proposed protest area in downtown Milwaukee. \u201cPublicly disclosing security information, as done in this letter, undermines our ability to maintain the integrity of our security plan and keep the convention, attendees, and the public safe,\u201d Guglielmi said. Guglielmi said the host city is responsible for establishing protest zones, not the agency. The RNC first publicly raised concerns to the agency over the proximity of planned protest zones in a letter last month. The risks have increased since then, Steggerda wrote Thursday, citing statements made by organizers for the Coalition to March on the RNC 2024 suggesting protesters may ignore law enforcement orders related to where they can demonstrate. Steggarda also asserted that requests by RNC leadership to meet with Cheatle have gone unanswered. A number of top Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have reached out to the Secret Service to discuss their concerns, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Guglielmi, though, said Secret Service personnel in Milwaukee have held multiple meetings focused on security plans for the convention with RNC Chair Michael Whatley, RNC staff and senators. \u201cThe director of the Secret Service continues to engage with Chair Whatley,\u201d Guglielmi said. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment to the agency\u2019s response. This headline and story have been updated.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial-defense-argument", "text": "Attorneys for Hunter Biden in a filing Thursday evening outlined some of the arguments they may bring in the upcoming gun trial in Delaware, including his state of mind when he purchased a firearm in 2018. Prosecutors have said they will present evidence \u2013 including text messages, pictures and excerpts from Biden\u2019s autobiography \u2013 to show that he was using illegal drugs around the time they say he purchased the firearm. The president\u2019s son faces three charges, including making false statements on a federal form and possessing a firearm while using illegal drugs. The trial is currently set for June 3. The filing from Biden\u2019s attorneys Thursday highlights several issues they see with instructions for the jury proposed by prosecutors. One issue defense attorneys raised in the filing is whether Biden believed he was a drug user or addict at the time of purchasing and possessing the firearm. \u201cThe terms \u2018user\u2019 or \u2018addict\u2019 are not defined on the form and were not explained to him,\u201d the defense attorneys wrote. \u201cSomeone, like Mr. Biden who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.\u201d The filing also highlights several arguments surrounding the Second Amendment. Biden\u2019s attorneys say that a jury should be instructed that the statute he has been charged with \u201cis violated only when a person is simultaneously armed and actively intoxicated, and using the weapon in some way that terrifies or endangers others.\u201d \u201cAs there is no evidence that Mr. Biden never loaded or fired the weapon, displayed it publicly, or threatened anyone with it, and was not in actual possession of the firearm throughout the entire eleven days from the time of purchase to disposal, the Special Counsel cannot meet that burden,\u201d the defense attorneys wrote. His attorneys added that the jury instructions proposed by prosecutors \u201cviolate the Second Amendment\u201d and \u201cunlawfully expand the scope\u201d of the gun-control law being used against him in the case. They added: \u201cA gun owner who leaves their guns behind when they head to the bar for a drink or locks their gun in a lockbox or safe while using marijuana (or taking a legally prescribed Oxycontin) is being responsible and should not be treated like a felon. That is not just good policy, it is a constitutional right under the Second Amendment.\u201d Biden\u2019s attorneys previously filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that the primary statute under which he\u2019s charged violates his rights under the Second Amendment. The motion was rejected by the judge presiding over the case. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will meet Friday with the federal judge overseeing over the case, Maryellen Noreika, for the final conference before trial begins. And hours before the hearing, Biden\u2019s lawyers doubled down on their push to keep his tax problems out of his upcoming gun trial. They reiterated a previous request that Noreika block prosecutors from telling the jury about the lurid and \u201cextravagant\u201d lifestyle that Hunter Biden lived while he was still struggling with alcohol and crack addiction. \u201cAny reference to money allegedly spent on, for example, adult entertainment, online chat rooms, or escort services is not relevant to the charges,\u201d they wrote. His spending is a key part of the tax indictment he faces in California, which his team claimed should not be mentioned at the gun trial, because it will prejudice the jury. \u201cAt this stage, the charges against Mr. Biden in California are just that\u2014 charges. Thus, they ought not be mentioned in the Delaware case,\u201d Biden\u2019s lawyers in a Friday morning filing. Prosecutors have said they don\u2019t plan to bring up Biden\u2019s \u201cextravagant\u201d spending beyond his drug purchases. It\u2019s unclear when the judge will issue decisions on these key pretrial questions.

{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters", "text": "With a holiday weekend happening between the final witness testimony and closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money criminal trial, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to look back at what we\u2019ve just seen. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb were inside the courtroom and an adjacent viewing room for all of the oral arguments \u2013 for all 20 days over the course of a month when the trial was in session. While these are the first criminal trial proceedings against Trump, he also faced a civil fraud trial brought by the New York attorney general and two separate defamation lawsuits brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A judge found Trump liable for fraud for inflating his net worth to get friendly loans, and juries found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defaming Carroll. CNN\u2019s reporters have covered all of the trials. I talked to Herb and del Valle about how they went about getting what happened in court out to the world in almost real time and what people watching on TV might have missed. Portions of those conversations, conducted by phone and email and edited for length, are below: What will you take away from covering this trial? DEL VALLE: This is actually my fourth Trump trial. They\u2019ve all been different. This is the first one where he\u2019s had to be there every second. We saw different versions of him, I would say, at each trial. He didn\u2019t show up to the first E. Jean Carroll trial. He came to some of civil fraud trial for big days. He did briefly get up on the stand, and that was a moment in itself that we didn\u2019t get to see here in the criminal trial. We saw a very angry Trump at the second E. Jean Carroll trial where he walked out of closing, was very emotional and had tension with the judge. Here, it\u2019s almost been interesting how at moments it just felt like a regular trial. That\u2019s never really been the case; we go through two levels of security, we have to wait in line hours before the trial starts, and we\u2019re very much controlled by the security for Trump, and that\u2019s not normal. But at the same time, Trump as a defendant has to sit there every second of the day. There are times where you can forget that you are watching the first former president to be on trial facing criminal charges. It\u2019s a shake yourself kind of moment to see him sit there like any other defendant I\u2019ve seen in that courtroom facing what could be a conviction. How did you cover a trial without cameras in real time for coverage on TV? HERB: Kara, Lauren and I watched every day of the trial unfold from two places: inside the courtroom or in an \u201coverflow\u201d auxiliary courtroom, where the proceedings were played on closed-circuit television. This was a historic trial, of course, and we used a brand-new method of filing updates to try to keep readers and viewers informed of what was happening literally second by second. This was possible because the press corps was allowed to use laptops in court (strictly no recording!), so we frantically took notes and then transmitted what we were seeing in real time to a Slack channel. From there, our editors quickly read our Slacks and added them to\u00a0CNN.com\u2019s live story, as well as to a \u201csidestream\u201d feed that was displayed live on air. The idea was to put readers and viewers in the room as best we could \u2013 our dispatches were sent mostly in single sentences so that we could keep updating as quickly as possible. Between the three of us, we tried to capture every moment, big and small, both in terms of quotes being said by the attorneys and witnesses as well as how others in the courtroom \u2013 mainly Trump \u2013 were reacting to what was happening. What did TV viewers miss? HERB: We tried to use descriptive language to describe what we were seeing and hearing, but words can only go so far to replace audio or video. I think it was often hard to capture the tone of a conversation, particularly when it got contentious. We also couldn\u2019t really convey what the jury was thinking \u2013 reporters were far enough away from the jurors that we could see them taking notes or watching the lawyers and witnesses, but it\u2019s hard to know whether they were truly engaged or how they were taking any given bit of testimony. What could you see of Trump? HERB: We made sure to have at least one person in the courtroom and one in overflow, because they give you two different vantage points. Reporters in the courtroom sat behind Trump \u2013 with a view often blocked by the many officers in the aisles of the gallery. In the overflow room, there was a big-screen TV set up that showed four shots: the prosecutors, the defense table, the judge and the witness. From the overflow room, that gave us a clear view of Trump\u2019s face, meaning we could see whether his eyes were closed (which didn\u2019t mean he was necessarily sleeping!). We could also see when he smirked or smiled at something or was writing and passing notes to his attorneys. From the courtroom, that same TV feed was displayed, but it was on a much smaller screen and farther away \u2013 some reporters had binoculars to try to get a better view. What were the most dramatic moments? During Stormy Daniels\u2019 testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Midway through the trial, Stormy, in vivid detail, describing certain things that were entirely taboo, that we wouldn\u2019t really expect to hear in a courtroom, was certainly, I wouldn\u2019t say dramatic, but it was definitely a moment that became a sideshow. It\u2019s not necessarily directly tied to the allegations or the charges in this case, but hearing her describe this alleged night with Trump in the hotel room, down to the anecdote of her smacking him on the butt with a magazine and his reaction in court, audibly cursing at that moment, was definitely a memory. During Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Then, during Cohen\u2019s testimony, on cross-examination (Trump attorney) Todd Blanche built up into what Blanche clearly thought was a gotcha moment, suggesting that Cohen made up a call keeping Trump informed in the Daniels scheme. Blanche suggested it was actually a call with Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, about a 14-year-old prankster who had been prank calling Cohen \u2026 in that moment, Blanche was flailing his arms, yelling in a high-pitched tone, telling Cohen he made this up. Cohen responded that, well, no, I think we could have talked about both things at the same time, or I believe this is the call. And Blanche told him the jury isn\u2019t here to hear what you believe. They need to know what the facts are. And that was right before a lunch break, and it kind of left energy in the room, and set a tone for the rest of the day. When the judge cleared the courtroom \u2026 HERB: The most dramatic moment I think happened when the jury was out of the room during the testimony of the final witness, Robert Costello. His testimony had been limited by the judge ahead of time, and prosecutors were successfully objecting repeatedly to Trump lawyer Emil Bove\u2019s questions. Costello was visibly annoyed at this, and even uttered \u201cridiculous\u201d while the attorneys were at a sidebar with the judge. When he let out a \u201cjeez\u201d after another objection, Judge Juan Merchan excused the jury to admonish the decorum of the witness, (who is) an attorney and former federal prosecutor. That\u2019s when things really got heated. \u201cAre you staring me down right now?\u201d Merchan said to Costello after dressing him down. \u201cClear the courtroom!\u201d the judge announced, leading to chaos as court officers forced reporters \u2013 and the attorney representing the media \u2013 to leave the courtroom over vigorous objections. DEL VALLE: I\u2019ve been in this courtroom for other trials many times. I have not seen a judge clear the courtroom of press to admonish a witness in a sidebar in such a way. The way Merchan handled that was definitely a surprise. How did Trump interact with the friends and aides whom he had not spoken to in some time and who testified for the prosecution? David Pecker, Trump\u2019s longtime friend who tried to use the National Enquirer to help \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories that could hurt Trump \u2026 DEL VALLE: It felt like by the end, Pecker was maybe trying to send Trump a message. Even though they have not spoken since all of this unraveled in 2018, Pecker made a point of saying really positive things about Trump. How long they\u2019ve known each other and had a really strong relationship. How, even though they haven\u2019t spoken recently, Trump has sent him a hello through other people that he\u2019s run into. He still considers Trump a friend all these years later. By the end there, it felt like Trump was watching him and listening to these words, like, who knows, maybe they could be friends publicly again. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary and White House communications director who has since moved on from Trump\u2019s orbit \u2026 DEL VALLE: It was interesting because she made a point of saying that she was paying for her own attorney. She was not by any means still tied to Trump, but she was actually overcome with emotion when they started the cross-examination. She was so nervous the whole time, but especially when it came to how she might be treated by Trump\u2019s side. I think her candor also caught Trump\u2019s attention, and he was definitely watching her at times \u2013 most of her testimony, actually. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump\u2019s former personal assistant at the White House \u2026 DEL VALLE: The one where it definitely felt like there was a connection \u2013 they exchanged eye contact when she came off the stand \u2013 was Madeleine Westerhout, who cried on the stand, was very emotional about the mistakes she made that led to her exit from the White House. She made clear how apologetic she was and what a great man she felt Trump was. He definitely was paying close attention to her and smiled at her at times, and seemed to give her a nod and a smile and maybe exchanged words with her on her way off the stand. Where were Trump\u2019s many supporters, including high-ranking Republican lawmakers? Was there any indication jurors recognized them? HERB: Both the prosecution and the defense were given the first two rows of seats behind their tables in the well for guests. On the prosecution side, District Attorney Alvin Bragg would sit here whenever he popped into the courtroom. On Trump\u2019s side, this was where the Republican lawmakers and other allies of Trump would sit. Trump aide Boris Epshteyn would often direct traffic and make sure they found their seats. On some days, Trump had so many people attending that a few would get relegated to the back row. As for the jury, it\u2019s hard to say whether they recognized any of the VIP guests. Every time they entered the courtroom, they walked past Trump\u2019s table \u2013 and 99% of the time, all of them looked straight ahead and not at the defendant or his guests. What less dramatic moments stand out? DEL VALLE: With Stormy, it was definitely interesting and we tried to describe it, but she was talking a mile a minute. The court reporter could not keep up at all. The prosecutor and the judge had to stop her several times to ask her to slow down. And at one point later in the day, on her direct examination, she leaned over to the court reporter and smiled at her, and said, \u201cAm I talking slower? Can you get it all?\u201d HERB: One of the things that isn\u2019t obvious if you aren\u2019t watching the proceedings is how collegial the lawyers on the opposing sides can be, even as they are viciously fighting against each other on the case and in rulings to try to help their side. During breaks, Blanche would occasionally jump to the other side of the well to speak with his counterparts, Susan Hoffinger or Joshua Steinglass, and more than a few laughs were shared with whatever it was they were discussing. While the press took up the majority of the seats, there were spaces dedicated to the general public \u2013 and some regulars who showed up every day, either sleeping overnight or, more likely, hiring line sitters who had a lucrative business throughout the trial saving spots in lines outside the courthouse for both media and the general public. My favorite light moment in court may have come when Trump attorney Emil Bove was cross-examining a paralegal for the district attorney\u2019s office, Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, who was testifying to enter into evidence call logs he had analyzed for the case. Bove asked him if putting together call summary charges could be \u201cat times, arguably, tedious work?\u201d \u201cHonestly, I kind of enjoyed it,\u201d Jarmel-Schneider said. The response prompted one of the biggest laughs in the courtroom in the entire trial \u2013 even several jurors were laughing. \u201cI hear that,\u201d Bove said in response. \u201cRespect.\u201d What will stick with you from covering this moment of history? HERB: This has easily been one of the most intense assignments I\u2019ve ever had at CNN. Not only is it historic and unprecedented, but the way we are covering it requires a constant focus throughout every hour of every day of the trial \u2013 and every moment, dramatic or monotonous \u2013 in order to make sure we are conveying it to our readers and viewers quickly and accurately. My hope is that I will be able look back at this unprecedented trial and be able to say we covered the historic moment fast and got it right (which I am not taking for granted until the trial is over!).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/politics/trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_hunter-biden-delaware-case", "text": "The judge in Hunter Biden\u2019s gun case issued a series of pretrial rulings Friday, handing wins to both sides and setting the contours of the upcoming trial. Federal Judge Maryellen Noreika sided with prosecutors on a\u00a0key question about what\u00a0they need to prove about Biden\u2019s drug use when he bought a gun in 2018. To win a conviction, she said they\u2019ll need to show that he was generally using drugs at the time, and not that he specifically used drugs on the day he bought the gun. Biden has advocated for the narrower scope of the law to be applied. But she also decided to allow Biden\u2019s lawyers to challenge the authenticity of specific texts\u00a0from his infamous laptop that will be presented to the jury by special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team. Biden\u2019s lawyers maintain that there are serious questions about the legitimacy\u00a0of the material. Prosecutors said\u00a0in court that they only want to introduce a small slice of the laptop material at trial. \u201cWhat we\u2019re using from the laptop are messages that will be corroborated by a witness who will testify that she sent those messages,\u201d prosecutor Derek Hines said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some vast array of messages.\u201d The issues were among the more than a dozen questions before the judge at Friday\u2019s hearing about what evidence could come in during the trial, which will begin June 3.\u00a0Biden was present at the hearing, as was Weiss. The president\u2019s son faces three charges in the case brought by\u00a0the special counsel\u00a0in Delaware. Prosecutors accuse Biden of buying and possessing a firearm while addicted to illegal drugs, which is a violation of federal law, and of lying on a form he submitted during the purchase about his drug use. Biden has pleaded not guilty. Lawyers said the trial could last up to two weeks, including jury selection, with the potential to go longer. Biden recently secured a delay in a separate, tax-evasion trial he is facing from the special counsel\u2019s investigation in California, which was originally slated for late June but is now expected to kick off in September. Dispute over ATF forms The parties also tussled over the forms from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that were filled out when Biden bought the revolver in a Wilmington gun shop in October 2018. The forms are a key piece of evidence because Biden is charged with making a false statement by checking a box that said he wasn\u2019t\u00a0using illegal drugs.\u00a0That\u2019s one of the boilerplate questions on the form that every gun buyer is required to fill out. But some credibility issues have emerged about the forms and the staff at the gun store, who are expected to be called as witnesses by Weiss. There are apparently two versions of the form involving Biden: The initial version that was\u00a0emailed\u00a0to the ATF not long after the purchase, and a paper copy that contains additional\u00a0written\u00a0information that the gun store staff added a couple years later. \u201cThey tampered with it,\u201d Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell said Friday, noting that the employees added details about how they verified Biden\u2019s identity in order to comply with federal law. At the time of the purchase, the store verified Biden\u2019s identity by using his passport. They later added information about his car registration. \u201cThey accepted an ID that they shouldn\u2019t have accepted,\u201d Lowell said, and now \u201cthe government is giving them a break\u201d by offering them some immunity so they can testify against Biden. The judge didn\u2019t issue any decisions Friday on the matter. Prosecutors have asked her to exclude the second, altered form from the trial altogether. Questions looming if Biden takes the stand There was minimal disagreement between prosecutors and the defense team on many of the 13 motions Noreika was considering Friday about what arguments a jury could hear. They generally agreed that Biden could not bring up claims that the prosecution violated the Second Amendment and that information from his failed plea deal \u2013 and the July 2023 hearing where\u00a0that\u00a0agreement fell apart\u00a0\u2013 should, in most circumstances, not come into the trial. The judge also granted Biden\u2019s request that the\u00a0paternity case\u00a0he faced in Arkansas be excluded, as should his 2014 discharge from the Navy\u00a0over a drug incident. She also limited what references prosecutors could make at trial to his lavish spending habits at the time of the gun purchase, narrowing such evidence to spending connected to drug use. She sided with Biden on whether prosecutors could refer to the tax charges. \u201cThere shall be no reference to the tax case,\u201d the judge said. However, the judge granted those requests with the caveat that she may need to revisit the questions about what a jury can hear if Biden decides to take the stand. His attorneys have not said whether the defendant will testify, and such a decision is usually not announced until the trial is well underway. \u201cA number of issues may become more contested\u201d if Biden testifies, Noreika said.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_louisiana-abortion-drugs-controlled-substances-law", "text": "Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed\u00a0a bill\u00a0Friday classifying the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifepristone as\u00a0Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances,\u00a0a first-of-its-kind law that places them in the same category as narcotics and depressants. \u201cRequiring an abortion inducing drug to be obtained with a prescription and criminalizing the use of an abortion drug on an unsuspecting mother is nothing short of common sense,\u201d Landry said\u00a0in a statement posted on X. \u201cThis bill protects women across Louisiana and I was proud to sign this bill into law today.\u201d Under the law, which\u00a0took effect\u00a0with the governor\u2019s signature, it is now a crime to possess the abortion medication without a prescription, as well as to give the drugs to a person without their consent. While proponents of the legislation say that it will protect expectant mothers, hundreds of health care providers in the state have come out against the reclassification, warning that it could create false perceptions around the medications\u2019 safety and prevent people from accessing necessary care. While abortion\u00a0is already banned\u00a0in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest, mifepristone and misopristol have other medical uses, including miscarriage care. Anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription could face a felony charge punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000. Pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption are exempt from such penalties. Louisiana doctors are also permitted under the law to prescribe the drugs. A conviction in Louisiana for distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs\u00a0carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000. In a\u00a0medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. Misoprostol is then taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, causing cramping and bleeding. Approved for other uses, such as miscarriage management, inducing labor, and preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades. As the bill made its way through the state\u2019s legislature, its critics argued that mifepristone and misoprostol are not dangerous and do not require the same level of regulation as Schedule IV substances. A group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students signed a letter to the bill\u2019s sponsor, state Sen. Thomas Pressly, expressing concerns over the reclassification. They argued that \u201cneither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\u201d Pressly, who proposed the legislation after he said his sister was given misoprostol against her will, has argued the legislation would not prevent the prescribing or dispensing of the drugs \u201cfor legitimate reasons.\u201d \u201cThe doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\u201d Pressly, a Republican, said\u00a0in rebutting the letter. CNN has reached out to the governor\u2019s office and Pressly\u2019s office for comment. Medication abortion, which makes up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States, emerged as a national political flashpoint after the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Supreme Court is currently considering a major case that challenges the FDA\u2019s approval of the drug mifepristone, with\u00a0a decision expected by July. A White House spokesperson told CNN the administration is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about efforts to restrict access to mifepristone. \u201cMake no mistake: these laws are not driven by concerns over women\u2019s health,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis is about coming after women\u2019s right to access reproductive health care since\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0was overturned\u2014with devastating effects on women\u2019s health and lives that we\u2019ve already seen in Louisiana and other states across the country.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_louisiana-abortion-drugs-controlled-dangerous-substances", "text": "Louisiana lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to a bill that would classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifepristone as\u00a0Schedule IV\u00a0controlled dangerous substances\u00a0in the state, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants. The state Senate voted 29-7 to pass the bill largely along party lines, which the state House approved earlier this week. It now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. CNN has reached out to Landry\u2019s office for comment. If signed into law, Louisiana would become the first state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. Senate Bill 276 would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. An amendment to classify the drugs as\u00a0Schedule IV substances\u00a0was added to the legislation after it initially passed out of the Senate, which then concurred the change on Thursday. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given the drug misoprostol against her will. Under the measure, anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription could face a felony charge \u2013 punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000.

Sarah Zagorski, the communications director for Louisiana Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, praised the GOP lawmakers that supported the bill in a statement Thursday. Zagorski also said the intention of the bill \u201cis to stop the abortion industry from profiting off of abuse and trafficking of vulnerable women through their flagrantly illegal distribution of pills.\u201d Critics have argued \u200b\u200bthat instead of helping women, the bill could prevent them from accessing necessary care. Michelle Erenberg, executive director of reproductive rights group Lift Louisiana, said the bill was a \u201clegitimate attempt to address a terrible crime\u201d that had been \u201chijacked by anti-abortion activists.\u201d \u201cIt is absurd that the state would continue to pass laws that will delay access to timely care for pregnant patients when we have one of the highest maternal death rates in the country,\u201d Erenberg added. Victoria, a New Orleans woman who flew across the country to get a medication abortion in 2023 because of Louisiana\u2019s ban on the procedure, said she felt \u201ctrapped\u201d and \u201cdehumanized\u201d when she heard the bill passed through the state Senate. She asked CNN to withhold her last name out of fear of backlash against her and her family. \u201cI feel trapped and dehumanized,\u201d she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s more infuriating is the completely disingenuous posture that the goal with these restrictions is to protect women. Clearly, that\u2019s a ruse and it\u2019s an attack on women\u2019s attempts to hold onto their right to self-determination.\u201d Medication abortion, which makes up the majority of abortions obtained in the United States, has emerged as a national political flashpoint since the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v.

A decision is expected by July. President Joe Biden said in a statement Thursday that the Louisiana bill is a \u201cdirect result\u201d of former President Donald Trump \u201coverturning Roe v. Wade.\u201d Trump appointed three of the conservative justices who voted to reverse the decades-old ruling. Biden added that \u201cthis is a scary time for women across America\u201d and said, if reelected, Trump will \u201ctry to make what is happening in states like Louisiana a reality nationwide.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

While Biden stayed away from mentioning former President Donald Trump or making an appeal to voters ahead of the November election, he drew a sharp contrast with his Republican rival by underscoring values Democrats have suggested are at risk, such as democracy and the NATO alliance. \u201cNothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cEvery\u00a0generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Speaking to the graduating class of cadets, Biden reiterated the US\u2019 support of Ukraine by saying,\u00a0\u201cWe\u00a0are standing strong with Ukraine and we will stand with them.\u201d In response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Biden said NATO was now\u00a0\u201cthe\u00a0greatest defense alliance in the history of the world \u2013 stronger than ever\u201d while praising its newest members, Sweden and Finland. The president\u2019s speech came as he deals with a delicate balancing act over his support for Israel in its war against Hamas, which has roiled college campuses across the country. The speech also followed a commencement address he gave last weekend at Morehouse College in which he appealed to Black voters while also acknowledging the anguish\u00a0simmering among young people over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The president on Saturday praised the US military for its work in building a temporary pier off the shore of Gaza, saying it was built \u201cin record time\u201d and \u201cincreased life-saving aid to the Palestinians.\u201d Aid groups began distributing\u00a0the humanitarian assistance offloaded at the pier to Palestinians this week after\u00a0encountering significant obstacles\u00a0on distribution routes that delayed the deliveries.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_elections-uk-mexico-what-matters", "text": "A large portion of Americans think the US government needs major, systemic reform \u2014 at least according to some polling \u2014 so it\u2019s worth looking at how other countries are doing things. Where are elections not never-ending? Anyone struggling to maintain interest in the never-ending, yearslong focus on the American presidential election might look with envy at the United Kingdom. Voters there only learned Wednesday they\u2019ll have an election in July, when rain-soaked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gambled by announcing a snap general election for July 4. No months of primaries. No party conventions. Everyone knew something was coming \u2014 Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party had until next January to call the election, and it seems like an excessive period since the last UK-wide election in December 2019 \u2014 but clearly the campaign portion will be truncated. Sunak and his party have six weeks to make up a steep deficit in the polls or at least hope to block an outright majority for the Labour Party. RELATED: 7 questions you might have about the UK\u2019s snap July general election British voters won\u2019t directly pick a prime minister. Instead, they\u2019ll select members of Parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority automatically becomes prime minister, and he or she assembles a government around them. It would be as if US House Speaker Mike Johnson appointed fellow lawmakers to run portions of the federal government. It can be a messy system, such as when the ruling Conservative Party churned through a series of prime ministers in recent years without having to get any input from voters. In contrast, India, which is the world\u2019s largest democracy and which, like the UK, has a parliamentary system of government, conducts its election over the course of many weeks. Results will be announced on June 4. CNN\u2019s Will Ripley was recently out on the campaign trail with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is vying for a third consecutive term. Modi\u2019s international reputation has morphed in those years from that of a reformer to that of a divisive nationalist, vilifying the country\u2019s Muslims in his bid to keep power. Where are they choosing between 2 younger women instead of 2 old men? Anyone struggling to find inspiration in the rematch of two senior citizens vying for the US presidency might look with some envy at Mexico, where the government bears many similarities to the US but where the president can only serve a single six-year term. That means Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador must step aside despite his relative popularity \u2014 and, at 70, youth \u2014 compared with the US options, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Instead of choosing between two older men, when Mexican voters go to the polls on June 2, they will be choosing between two younger women. L\u00f3pez Obrador endorsed the front-runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate from his Morena Party who previously led the Mexico City government. The candidate for an opposition coalition is Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, a former Mexican senator. Both are 61. There are other candidates, although they have little chance of winning. Tragedy struck the campaign trail Wednesday when a stage collapsed due to heavy winds, killing nine people. It\u2019s a direct election \u2014 no Electoral College \u2014 and the person who gets the most votes wins. Where do judges not have lifetime appointments? Another difference in Mexico is that Supreme Court justices serve a 15-year term instead of the justice-for-life tradition in the US. If the US had term limits, Samuel Alito would be three years off the bench and free to fly whatever flag he wanted at any of his homes. Instead, with no term limits and no binding ethics rules for US Supreme Court justices, there\u2019s nothing to keep Alito from joining opinions related to November\u2019s election. That\u2019s despite the fact that the flags outside his homes suggest he might have some preferences. Does an upside-down flag flown outside his home in Virginia days before \ufeffBiden\u2019s inauguration betray a bias? Does the flying of a flag seen at the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally suggest a friendliness to Christian nationalists? There\u2019s arguably more evidence of a preference in the activism of fellow justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni. Thomas, who was appointed to the bench in 1991 by then-President George H.W. Bush, is more than 30 years into his Supreme Court tenure. Both Thomas and Alito, in their 70s, are younger than both of the men most primary voters for the major political parties have selected to run for president. Where do they overhaul their court systems? If the nature of the US Supreme Court seems immutable and unchangeable, it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no political will to change the system, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. Congress could, in theory, impose term limits on justices. It could also change the number of justices on the court, as it has in the past. There are active campaigns to change the US system, including changing the number of justices and imposing 18-year term limits. But these do not currently have major political momentum. Plus, Republicans rightly feel they will enjoy an advantage with the current system for decades to come. It\u2019s unlikely they would buy into an overhaul. The UK actually overhauled its Supreme Court with a Constitutional Reform Act back in 2005, although a major difference between the UK and the US is that the UK does not technically have a written constitution. There are plenty of cautionary tales out there as well about other forms of government. In Russia and China, where free speech and the press are seriously limited, autocratic leaders have instilled themselves and are looking to widen their worldwide influence. El Salvador had a ban on its president serving two consecutive terms, but a court full of appointees by controversial President Nayib Bukele gave him the power to seek and win reelection in February. That\u2019s not an option in the US, where the 22nd Amendment only allows for a person to serve two four-year presidential terms. Whoever wins in November \u2014 Biden or Trump \u2014 will be unable to run again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/elections-uk-mexico-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_donald-trump-bronx-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump held a rally Thursday in the Bronx as his campaign looks to make inroads with Hispanic and Black voters ahead of November\u2019s election. The event in one of the most Democratic counties in the country comes days ahead of closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York criminal hush money trial. Trump faces 34 felony counts and has pleaded not guilty. The trial has tethered the former president to New York for much of the past six weeks, but Thursday\u2019s event in Crotona Park in the South Bronx was Trump\u2019s first major campaign rally in the state since his initial presidential run in 2016. Trump has visited a bodega, which was the scene of a fatal stabbing in 2022, a construction site and a fire station in Manhattan since his trial began in mid-April. As he addressed supporters in the park Thursday, Trump dedicated most of his remarks to bashing President Joe Biden, arguing that his rival is \u201cnot getting the job done for the Bronx,\u201d the state of New York or the country. \u201cAfrican Americans are getting slaughtered. Hispanic Americans are getting slaughtered,\u201d Trump said as he argued that they have been negatively impacted by Biden\u2019s border and economic policies. \u201cThese millions and millions of people that are coming into our country, the biggest impact and the biggest negative impact is against our Black population and our Hispanic population who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose,\u201d he said. A Trump campaign official told CNN that several factors, including the former president\u2019s long history of living and working in New York and his efforts to win over minority voters, played into the decision to hold the Bronx rally. The official said that the area\u2019s proximity to Trump\u2019s criminal trial was also a consideration, as was the former president\u2019s desire to \u201cchallenge the status quo\u201d in a state that has long voted for Democrats. Trump has insisted that he has a shot this fall at winning New York, which a Republican presidential nominee has not carried since 1984. The Bronx is a Democratic stronghold, which Trump lost by about 68 points to Biden in 2020. That margin, however, was down from four years earlier, when Hillary Clinton carried the county by 79 points. Trump\u2019s improvement was even greater in the South Bronx, where Thursday\u2019s rally took place. Biden won the election district (or precinct) surrounding Crotona Park by 69 points. Clinton carried the same precinct by more than 90 points in 2016. Trump\u2019s performance in the Bronx in 2020 mirrored his results in other areas where Hispanic voters make up a substantial portion of the electorate. Residents in the South Bronx are mainly Hispanic (64%) and Black (31%), according to the US Census Bureau. Polling this year shows Trump may do even better among Hispanic and Black voters than he did four years ago. Surveys taken since the beginning of April show Biden\u2019s margin among these voters down double digits compared with surveys from the same point in 2020. This is likely part of the reason why the Biden campaign launched two new ads Thursday aimed at highlighting what it called \u201cTrump\u2019s long record of failures and broken promises\u201d to Black Americans. The spots point out that Trump was sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s and charged with discriminating against African Americans; promoted the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US;\u00a0pushed for the death penalty for five minority teenagers who were wrongly accused and convicted of beating and raping a woman in Central Park in the 1980s; and \u201cstood with violent White supremacists\u201d in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The Trump campaign said the ads represented an attempt to \u201cgaslight Black voters.\u201d \u201cWe must not forget that it was Joe Biden who was a key figure in passing the 1994 Crime Bill, which disproportionately harmed Black communities through harsh sentencing laws and increased incarceration rates. Additionally, we cannot overlook that Biden\u2019s policies are driving Black families deeper into poverty and making them less safe,\u201d Janiyah Thomas, the campaign\u2019s Black media director, said in a statement. Several House Republicans from New York said they couldn\u2019t make it to Trump\u2019s event due to changes in the chamber\u2019s voting schedule Thursday. \u201cNew York is in play and we had all planned to be there to greet him and attend this historic event. However, the House schedule changed and we will be voting to ban illegal immigrants from voting in elections and to protect American\u2019s right to financial privacy,\u201d House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, seen as a potential Trump running mate,\u00a0said in a joint statement with seven other lawmakers. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ritchie Torres, who represent parts of the Bronx, blasted the former president ahead of the event. Ocasio-Cortez, in an interview with NY1, called it an \u201cattempt to, I think, trick some of our folks here,\u201d while Torres told The New York Times that Trump was \u201cradioactive\u201d in the Bronx. Trump\u2019s outreach to minority voters also comes as the former president has made stoking fears about undocumented migrants a cornerstone of his campaign. He has regularly made false or misleading claims about illegal immigration and\u00a0used dehumanizing language when referring to migrants.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_lloyd-austin-transfer-duties-medical-procedure", "text": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin \u201cunderwent a successful, elective, and minimally invasive follow-up non-surgical procedure related to his bladder issue at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center\u201d on Friday and has resumed his duties as secretary, according to the Pentagon. The procedure took 2.5 hours, during which time his authorities were temporarily transferred to\u00a0his deputy, Kathleen Hicks, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. Austin subsequently resumed his functions and duties as the secretary of defense at\u00a08:25 p.m. ET\u00a0and has returned home, Ryder said. The procedure was related to a bladder issue Austin suffered as a result of a surgery he underwent to treat prostate cancer last year. Ryder announced that Austin would undergo the planned procedure earlier Friday. The notification from Ryder is part of the Pentagon\u2019s attempt to be more transparent about Austin\u2019s health \u2013 Austin underwent two surgeries at Walter Reed in December and January without telling the president, his deputy, or the public, sparking controversy. He later admitted he should have disclosed his hospitalizations and pledged to be more transparent. \u201cI want to be crystal clear: We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,\u201d Austin said in February, weeks after he was hospitalized on New Year\u2019s Day following complications from a previous surgery on December 22 to treat his cancer. \u201cI apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\u201d Austin was hospitalized on January 1 for complications related to the prostate cancer surgical procedure in December, including severe abdominal, hip and leg pain. He transferred his authorities to Hicks during both procedures, Ryder has said. But Hicks was not informed either time why the secretary was delegating his powers to her. At the time of the January 1 procedure, Hicks was in Puerto Rico on vacation and had to exercise the secretary\u2019s authorities from there. A Pentagon review of Austin\u2019s delayed notification of his January hospitalization found there was no deliberate attempt to \u201cobfuscate\u201d the situation, but did find that Austin\u2019s staff was unwilling to share information out of concern for privacy. The review also made a series of recommendations to improve processes around the transfer of authorities to his deputy. The review made eight total recommendations, which Austin has said he will be implementing. Those mostly focus on processes and guidelines, such as requiring proposed training or communication plans to ensure officials and their staffs are aware of their responsibilities during a transfer of authority. Austin has also directed a review of internal reporting requirements for transfer of authorities from the general counsel. Friday\u2019s announcement of Austin\u2019s procedure came as he was meeting with Kenyan President William Ruto at the Pentagon. Moments before the press release came out, Austin and Ruto were making opening remarks ahead of their bilateral meeting, expressing their interest in working closely together and recognizing the close relationship between the US and Kenya.

{"id": "2024_05_22_politics_trump-trial-jury-analysis", "text": "It was a tawdry tale of lies, revenge and hush money, with a sordid alleged bedroom scene, a judge whose patience finally cracked and a raging defendant who is a once and possibly future president. But there\u2019ll be no more evidence, witnesses, or brutal cross-examinations in Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial, which has moved into the final phase before jurors retire to deliberate their verdict in a historic case entangled with the 2024 election. Unusually, there will now be a break of a week \u2014 because of the Memorial Day holiday \u2014 between Tuesday\u2019s final testimony and when lawyers for each side lay out their final narratives in closing summations. Then the judge will deliver his instructions \u2014 a critical stage of the case in which the jury will learn how to apply the law and to weigh conflicting testimony and different kinds of evidence. That\u2019s when seven men and five women from New York will have to decide whether Trump will be the first ex-president convicted of a crime and the first presumptive nominee running as a convicted felon. The former president has been preparing for the moment for weeks. He\u2019s mounted a daily campaign to destroy the reputation of the court and Judge Juan Merchan, as well as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, who brought the case. \u201cThe judge hates Donald Trump, just take a look, take a look at him, take a look at where he comes from. He can\u2019t stand Donald Trump,\u201d the former president said on Tuesday in the latest of his daily media rants in the corridor. At one point, the judge threatened to send him to jail if he continued to violate a gag order protecting key witnesses \u2013 establishing a red line that the ex-president is yet to cross. Trump\u2019s bizarre practice of reading aloud critiques of the case from his allies in conservative media was all designed to create an atmosphere of grievance around the trial, which he\u2019s leveraged to bolster the core rationale of his White House campaign \u2014 that he\u2019s a persecuted victim of weaponized justice. As the weeks went on, Trump was joined at the court by a cadre of Republican lawmakers, exemplifying his total control over the GOP after winning his third consecutive nomination and its continued genuflection toward a leader who tried to destroy American democracy to stay in power after the 2020 election. It\u2019s still early to say if the case in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty \u2014 and the eventual verdict \u2014 will have any influence on voters this fall. But there is little sense the trial, from which television cameras are barred, has captured the imagination of the nation. The intricate task that awaits jurors It\u2019s impossible to know how jurors are interpreting the daily drama of the courtroom in any trial. But there\u2019s a lot to sort out in a case that has grave implications for Trump\u2019s future, and even his liberty, and comes with huge political overtones as potentially the only one of his four criminal trials to be completed before the election. In a month of dramatic testimony, the prosecution alleged that Trump illegally falsified business records to cover up a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to deceive voters in 2016 in an example of election interference. Trump has denied the alleged affair with Daniels, and hush money payments are not illegal in themselves. But the jury must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York State prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records \u2014 which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime \u2014 in relation to the election. \u201cThe defendant Donald Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,\u201d prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors in his opening statement in April. The defense, however, contends that Trump is innocent of any crime. His lawyers have sought to cast doubt on the paper trail established by prosecutors by saying Trump had nothing to do with falsifying financial records and they\u2019ve tried to obliterate the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s star witness, Michael Cohen. The ex-president\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d is critical to the case because he provided the only direct implication of Trump in an alleged scheme to break the law with the cover up of the payment. And the defense tried to establish that Trump did not try to suppress details of his alleged affair with Daniels as part of a scheme to mislead voters. Rather, they argued, he was worried that it would upset his family. And in his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche told jurors: \u201cI have a spoiler alert. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to influence an election: It\u2019s called democracy.\u201d The critical witness Cohen\u2019s testimony will likely be a critical element of the deliberations \u2014 especially whether the damage done to his trustworthiness during a searing cross-examination is enough to convince one or more jurors they cannot convict Trump based on his former fixer\u2019s word. Prosecutors knew that they had a problem with Cohen heading into the trial since he had already gone to jail after being found guilty over offenses related to the hush money payment and other crimes, including lying to Congress. They therefore sought to buttress his testimony before he took the stand with days of evidence. They called David Pecker, the former head of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Pecker was not directly involved in the hush money payment at the center of the case. But he was used to establish that Cohen and Trump had a record of using payments to squash unflattering stories about the future president before the 2016 election. Former White House communications director and long-time Trump aide Hope Hicks was also called by the prosecution and appeared to put her former boss in a heap of trouble when she said that his campaign was transfixed with worry over the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that showed him boasting that he could grab women by the genitals. Hicks testified that Trump believed that the Daniels story would be even more damaging. \u201cIt would be better to be dealing with it now, and that it would have been bad to have that story come out before the election,\u201d Hicks said of his thinking. Why the most salacious evidence may have been \u2018best left unsaid\u2019 In the most risqu\u00e9 chapter of the trial, Daniels was called to testify about her alleged liaison with Trump in a suite in Lake Tahoe in 2006. Daniels said that she \u201cspanked\u201d Trump \u201cright on the butt\u201d with a magazine and returned from the bathroom to find him on the bed in his boxers and a T-shirt. She said that they had sex and that she was shaking when she left the room, which she remembered for its black-and-white-tiled floor. The judge had sought to limit the details of the encounter ahead of time, and after the testimony he commented that some of the explicit details were \u201cbest left unsaid.\u201d But the Daniels testimony was critical to the prosecution case because it illustrated the alleged liaison that it wants jurors to believe was the genesis of the cover up. When Cohen finally took the stand, he directly implicated Trump in the alleged scheme to buy Daniels\u2019 silence.\u00a0\u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, smart people, and \u2018That it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re a billionaire, just pay it. There\u2019s no reason to keep this thing out there so do it.\u2019 He expressed to me, \u2018Just do it,\u2019\u201d Cohen said, paraphrasing Trump\u2019s alleged instructions to him. The former fixer, who once said he\u2019d take a bullet for Trump, also denied that he had acted alone, saying that everything he did for his former boss required Trump\u2019s sign off \u2014 and that he wanted to make sure he was paid back. But Cohen\u2019s reputation came back to haunt him in a cross-examination when the defense claimed he was a liar who was obsessed with bringing Trump down and that he was getting rich from his media appearances and podcasts focusing on his former idol. The key moment came when Cohen was tripped up over a phone call about which he\u2019d previously testified under oath. He said he had discussed with Trump the payment of the hush money in that October 2016 call. But the defense produced texts Cohen sent before the call \u2014 placed to the phone of Trump\u2019s bodyguard, who was with the then-2016 GOP nominee \u2014 that suggested the subject of the 96-second conversation was another matter. In response, prosecutors used their redirect examination to try to downplay the importance of a single call, and Cohen said he spoke to Trump about the payment multiple times, not just on that occasion. But Trump\u2019s lawyers beseeched the judge on Monday to throw out the trial based on Cohen\u2019s testimony, saying the jury should not be asked to deliver a verdict based on what the defense viewed as unsafe evidence. \u201cThere is no way that the Court should let this case go to the jury, relying on Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony,\u201d Blanche told Merchan. In comparison to the weeks of testimony put on by the prosecution, the defense case lasted only 90 minutes and included only two witnesses before Trump\u2019s lawyers rested on Tuesday. That meant the former president, who many experts thought would pose a massive risk to his own case if he testified, did not take the stand. Some experts questioned whether the defense would also have been better not to have called one of its witnesses \u2014\u00a0Robert Costello, who got into a verbal altercation with an infuriated Merchan, some of which was seen by the jury. In an extraordinary scene, Merchan asked whether Costello was trying to stare him down after the witness had registered contempt for several of the judge\u2019s interventions. Costello was meant to rebut a claim by prosecutors that Trump mounted a pressure campaign to keep Cohen quiet in 2018. But he may have ended up creating a hole in the Trump defense, according to several legal experts. At the very least, his spell on the stand may have made a case that looked in recent days like it could turn on the reputation of Cohen once again focus on the behavior and character of the ex-president. It may have all been a sideshow that will have little bearing on the eventual destiny of the trial. But only the jury can decide that.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/trump-trial-jury-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_trump-gag-order-trump-classified-documents", "text": "Special counsel\u2019s office prosecutors on Friday asked a federal judge in Florida to place a gag order on Donald Trump that would limit his ability to comment about law enforcement that searched his Mar-a-Lago resort. The request \u2013\u00a0a first in the classified documents mishandling case \u2013 comes after the former president has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search and seizure of government records at his resort in August 2022. While Trump has told his supporters he could have been in danger because of the policy, the policy is standard protocol for FBI searches and limits how agents may use force in search operations.\u00a0The same standard FBI policy was used in the searches of President Joe Biden\u2019s homes and offices in\u00a0a separate\u00a0classified documents investigation. Prosecutors for special counsel Jack Smith wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon in a filing Friday night that the conditions that allow Trump not to be in jail awaiting trial should be updated. The request will force Cannon into the center of an intensely charged and politicized battle, grappling with Trump\u2019s ongoing presidential campaign and the First Amendment at the same time prosecutors are escalating their concerns to her about proceedings she oversees. The judge so far has moved slowly to resolve disputes in Trump\u2019s criminal mishandling and obstruction of justice case before her, and no trial date is set. The prosecutors say the gag order is needed to protect the integrity of the criminal case and law enforcement officers associated with it. They wrote that the former president\u2019s inflammatory statements could cause his supporters to retaliate against federal authorities, some of whom may be witnesses in the case. \u201cTrump\u2018s repeated mischaracterization as an attempt to kill him, his family, and Secret Service agents has endangered law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case and threatened the integrity of these proceedings,\u201d prosecutors wrote. His recent comments, they added, \u201cinvite the sort of threats and harassment that have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d The use of deadly force policy is included among several pages of paperwork governing FBI search protocol and policies when they went to Mar-a-Lago, which was made public in Trump\u2019s case in federal court this week. The paperwork also lays out that agents would wear unmarked, business casual attire, and specifies that if Trump were to arrive at Mar-a-Lago during the search, leadership on site would speak to him and his Secret Service detail. Pushback from Trump\u2019s team Prosecutors say Trump\u2019s lawyers told them they are against a restriction on his ability to comment about law enforcement\u00a0who worked on the investigation, and they opposed the special counsel\u2019s office responding to Trump\u2019s recent remarks to the court late Friday of Memorial Day weekend. \u201cThey do not believe that there is any imminent danger, and asked to meet and confer next Monday,\u201d prosecutors added in the filing. Trump\u2019s legal team is preparing to respond in court over the weekend, a person familiar with Trump\u2019s approach told CNN. Prosecutors noted that Trump has been amplifying accusations\u00a0about the FBI in the search on his Truth Social account\u00a0Friday. \ufeffTrump\u2019s campaign sent a fundraising email on Tuesday that claimed FBI agents were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d at Mar-a-Lago. Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s campaign spokesman, in response to the prosecutors\u2019 request\u00a0Friday night said Biden administration\u00a0\u201cHacks and Thugs are obsessed with trying to deprive President Trump and all American voters of their First Amendment rights. Repeated attempts to silence President Trump during the presidential campaign are blatant attempts to interfere in the election.\u201d Escalating responses to Trump\u2019s attacks The Justice Department request to the court on Friday specifically asks Cannon to restrict Trump\u2019s ability to comment on law enforcement by changing his conditions of pre-trial release from\u00a0jail. That is a different approach from what the special counsel\u2019s office took in pursuing limitations on what Trump could say about his 2020 election case in Washington, DC\u2019s federal court. It potentially could carry greater consequence and be monitored by court probation authorities in addition to the Justice Department, according to sources familiar with the case. In a notably direct pushback to Trump, Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday addressed the claims that Trump has made about the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cThat allegation is false, and it is extremely dangerous. The document that is being referred to in the allegation is the Justice Department\u2019s standard policy, limiting the use of force,\u201d Garland said. \u201cAs the FBI advises, it is part of the standard operations plan for searches,\u201d Garland said. \u201cAnd in fact, it was even used in the consensual search of President Biden\u2019s home.\u201d The FBI reiterated the same in a statement of its own this week, an indication of the concern Trump\u2019s remarks have set off within the federal law enforcement agencies. Previously, prosecutors on Trump\u2019s classified documents case successfully fought for the judge to keep names of FBI agents who worked on the Mar-a-Lago search blacked out in recent court filings,\u00a0because of\u00a0fears of threats and harassment. The FBI and Justice Department have dealt with a substantial\u00a0number\u00a0of threats since the search of Mar-a-Lago nearly two years ago, particularly after times Trump amplified false information about the federal law enforcement approach. For instance, a\u00a0man who was\u00a0a\u00a0prolific poster on Trump\u2019s social media platform tried to attack the FBI\u2019s Cincinnati field office in the wake of the search. Courts outside of Florida have upheld gag orders that bar Trump from speaking about witnesses, potential jurors and staff working on his cases because of threats and harassment his comments have prompted, among other reasons. Trump\u2019s ability to comment publicly is still limited in\u00a0his ongoing\u00a0New York\u00a0trial,\u00a0where he has been held in contempt and fined 10 times for violating that gag order, and in\u00a0his Washington, DC-based election interference case, where he is awaiting trial in federal court.

Former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, actor LeVar Burton,\u00a0NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries were among the distinguished guests invited to the official \ufeffstate dinner \u2013\u00a0with former President Barack Obama making a brief, surprise appearance. \u201cThere is a bright light at the White House tonight,\u201d Biden said to the Kenyan president during his toast at the state dinner. \u201cJill and I are honored to have you here.\u201d He then joked that \u201cmany members of the African diaspora\u201d were at Thursday\u2019s black-tie event, including Obama who \u201cjust left.\u201d Biden added that Obama has been \u201cvery gracious\u201d and met with Ruto earlier Thursday. The former president was not on the initial state dinner guest list released by the White House. He attended a reception in the Blue Room prior to the dinner and stopped into the dinner area briefly, according to his office. Obama, whose father was born in Kenya, visited the country as president in 2015 and returned in 2018 after leaving office. Biden added that the United States has a \u201cstrong respect\u201d for Kenya and recalled when former President Jimmy Carter hosted Kenyan leaders for the first time. He concluded with an Irish toast, saying in part \u201cuntil we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand - to Kenya, to our guests.\u201d During his toast, Ruto asked attendees to raise a glass to the \u201ccontinued wellbeing and long life\u201d of President Biden and the first lady. A state visit\u00a0is among the highest diplomatic tools a White House can employ to honor a top ally, with the\u00a0meticulously planned event arriving as Biden seeks to\u00a0emphasize the strong alliance\u00a0between the two countries.

Guests were expected to be served three courses \u2013 the first was a chilled heirloom tomato soup. The main course for Thursday\u2019s dinner was a \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d duo of butter-poached lobster and smoked beef short ribs, according to White House\u00a0Executive\u00a0Chef Cris Comerford. Sports commissioners\u00a0Goodell\u00a0and Silver were\u00a0among\u00a0the\u00a0guests invited to Thursday night\u2019s state dinner. The NFL hosted a talent identification camp in Kenya last year as it looked to expand its\u00a0\u201cNFL Africa\u201d program, according to a\u00a0press release from the time.\u00a0NBA Africa has a\u00a0\u201csubsidiary\u201d in Kenya that was opened in November\u00a02023, per the league. Philanthropist Melinda French Gates and former longtime Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg were also\u00a0among\u00a0the\u00a0guests invited to Thursday\u2019s dinner. Country star Brad Paisley and the Howard Gospel Choir provided the entertainment at the glitzy event. Paisley donned a white cowboy hat as he entered the White House Thursday evening.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_republicans-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Top Republicans are already rushing to buy into a new 2024 election fraud narrative sown by ex-President Donald Trump in their zeal to appease their party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Leading\u00a0party figures are increasingly warning they will only recognize the result of November\u2019s presidential vote if there is no fraud. But there is no indication that there will be irregularities in the election. And their warnings come despite many Republican state legislatures taking steps to tighten voting rules \u2014 based on Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in 2020. The new Republican trend of casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election in advance was exhibited by Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. The Texas lawmaker, who in 2016\u00a0fell in\u00a0line behind Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s insults about his father and his wife, falsely stated that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of voting irregularities, multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, rejected the former president\u2019s claims he was cheated out of power. And Trump\u2019s then-attorney general, William Barr, looked into his claims and decided that there was no widespread fraud that would have changed the result of the election. But Cruz told Collins that a question about whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election was \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time.\u201d Cruz, who objected to election results in Arizona, which Trump narrowly lost to Biden, on January 6, 2021, went on to suggest there was significant fraud in 2020. And he implied the same could happen this year. \u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz said. A sign of Trump\u2019s power The equivocating of senior Republicans appears motivated by a fear of crossing Trump, the twice-impeached GOP leader who has the power to end careers in the party simply by turning against an individual lawmaker. The positioning looks a lot like laying the groundwork for a challenge to the fairness of the 2024 election if Trump loses in November. Undermining an election even before it happens represents a grave threat to democracy. The attempt to raise the specter of election fraud this year is especially corrosive because of the likelihood that the 2024 vote will be decided in a handful of swing states by mere thousands of ballots and raises the possibility of prolonged legal action by Trump\u2019s camp that would tarnish yet another US election. Trump is still claiming falsely that Mike Pence had the constitutional authority power to overturn the 2020 election result, and the former vice president has been largely ostracized within his party for following the Constitution and overseeing the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Cruz is just one of the latest senior party figures to try to avoid getting on the wrong side of Trump when asked whether they will accept the result of the 2024 election. The attempt to win Trump\u2019s favor follows an interview that Trump gave to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper earlier this month. \u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results. I don\u2019t change on that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d His comments carried the implicit threat that he will decide if he loses, as he did in 2020, that the election was not fair. Trump frequently claims he did better in the popular vote four years ago than any incumbent president, creating a false argument that it was therefore impossible to lose to Biden, who got more votes. Trump\u2019s renewed election denialism is disturbing for several reasons. First, it mirrors his pre-election spin in 2020, when he suggested that the election might not be fair \u2014 which he later built upon after losing to Biden with a widespread campaign that culminated in the mob attack by his supporters on the Capitol\u00a0that was\u00a0designed to thwart the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Trump often leaves the impression that any election he loses cannot, by definition, be legitimate. His false claims about election fraud in 2020 are now believed by millions of Republican voters despite the fact that he has been indicted twice \u2014 in a federal case and in Georgia \u2014 for his attempts to steal the election and stay in power. Comments like Cruz\u2019s on Wednesday serve to create an expectation among some voters that the coming election will not be fair, even though there is no indication that this, or any other US election, will be tarnished by fraud,\u00a0which historically has only taken place at very low levels. Republican senators try to demonstrate loyalty to Trump The Texas senator is far from the only senior party figure to buy into Trump\u2019s claims,\u00a0a trend that shows the sheer power of Trump in the GOP. It also follows the announcement by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Wednesday that she will vote for Trump despite having called him \u201cunhinged\u201d and unfit to serve in the Oval Office again during her primary campaign earlier this year. Her move appeared to be an attempt to retain viability in the Republican Party for any future run for president. It seems like it should be easy for Republicans just to state that they will accept the result of the 2024 election and that US presidential votes in the modern era have not been tainted by fraud. But they can\u2019t seem to do it. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, whom Trump mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender on Thursday, said on CNN the same night, \u201cI will accept the results if it\u2019s done in a fair and transparent way,\u201d going on to raise doubts about mail-in voting. Also on CNN Thursday night, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds \u2014 who\u2019s also been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d accept the results if Trump loses. \u201cIf the states and localities actually follow the rules and procedures and everybody sees the rules followed, then of course, you accept what\u2019s done,\u201d Donalds said. Earlier this week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in 2016 but has since adopted Trumpian positions, was asked Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether he would accept the result of the election \u201cno matter what happens.\u201d He replied: \u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested by either side.\u201d He claimed that Democrats have \u201copposed every Republican victory since 2000\u201d and added: \u201cIf it\u2019s unfair, we are going to do the same thing Democrats do \u2026 we\u2019re going to use lawyers to go to court and point out the fact that states are not following their own election laws.\u201d Rubio\u2019s comment is misleading because, while there were some claims by small groups of Democrats that the elections of 2004 and 2016 featured some fraud, the Democratic candidates in each case quickly conceded to Republicans,\u00a0unlike Trump, who has never accepted that he lost. The 2000 election was contested by Republicans and Democrats over a recount controversy in Florida, the pivotal state. The Democratic candidate,\u00a0then-Vice President\u00a0Al Gore, eventually conceded after the case was adjudicated by the Supreme Court \u2014 a step that Trump never took as he sought to disrupt the American tradition of peaceful transfers of power. The idea that the 2024 election may not be free and fair was also raised recently by Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance,\u00a0who is reported to be on Trump\u2019s shortlist as a potential vice presidential nominee. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier this month that \u201cI totally plan to accept the results of 2024,\u201d while holding out the possibility that the election may not be fair if Trump were to lose. \u201cI think that Donald Trump will be (the victor).\u00a0And if it\u2019s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results. And, again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president, been reelected president.\u201d Vance argued that parties in the election had to be willing to prosecute their cases if they believed there was election fraud. But academic studies and multiple legal cases have shown that fraud in presidential elections only occurs in isolated cases. That\u2019s not stopping Republicans demonstrating their loyalty to Trump by casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election before it even happens. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trump-nazi-allusions-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump dabbles in Nazi allusions too often for it to be a coincidence. The latest example is a video posted on the ex-president\u2019s social media account that features a fake headline implying the US could become a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins a second term in November. The video replicates what appears to be World War I-era newspapers. But the term \u201cReich,\u201d which means a kind of empire, is also synonymous with the later Third Reich of Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi Germany. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s campaign insisted the sharing of the third-party video on Monday was the work of a staffer and not Trump, who was in court. It was eventually taken down hours later on Tuesday. Trump may not have not been responsible for the post. But campaigns reflect the character of the candidate. And Trump has been flirting with Nazi imagery and giving comfort to far-right extremists for years. He recently accused President Joe Biden of running a \u201cGestapo\u201d administration. Trump has several times warned immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the United States, echoing language used by Hitler in his manifesto \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d which the ex-president claims he hasn\u2019t read. Back in 2017, Trump equivocated about condemning a White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which marchers chanted \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d Trump also allegedly praised Hitler, according to former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was quoted by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto in his new book \u201cThe Return of Great Powers.\u201d Kelly commented: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, but Hitler did some good things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, [Hitler] rebuilt the economy.\u2019\u201d Sciutto also cited Kelly as saying that Trump believed that Hitler\u2019s hold on senior Nazi officers displayed a loyalty he did not enjoy from his senior subordinates. When the book was published, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not comment on the substance of the allegations from Kelly and another former White House official, former national security advisor John Bolton. But he accused them both of \u201csuffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d In 2021, a Trump spokeswoman denied the former president had praised Hitler. Some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests an ignorance of history and his own self-obsession. But it must also be viewed in the context of a past and possibly future president who admires present day tyrants and dictators and has vowed to use the powers of the presidency to enact personal and political retribution. He\u2019s promising the biggest deportation operation in history to expel undocumented migrants. And his echoing of Nazi rhetoric on immigration has the same consequence as Hitler\u2019s \u2014 to demonize outsiders supposedly threatening the \u2018native\u2019 purity of the homeland. Trump has already tried to avoid leaving power after a democratic election he lost, whipping up his supporters ahead of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. And over the weekend, he spitballed about potentially serving more than the two terms to which the Constitution says he can be elected.\u00a0Some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric seems designed to get a rise from his opponents and the media. But a strongman\u2019s aspirations lay behind it. And the searing demagoguery of his rallies increasingly resembles a tyrant\u2019s theatrics. Biden seized on the latest evidence of extremism in Trump\u2019s orbit by telling Democratic donors in Boston on Tuesday that \u201cthis is the same guy that uses Hitler\u2019s language, not America\u2019s.\u201d\u00a0He also used the furor to bolster his warnings that Trump\u2019s return to the White House would be a disaster for democracy. \u201cThe threat that Trump poses is greater in the second term than it was in the first.\u201d It\u2019s a good rule in politics that no one should use Nazi-themed rhetoric or allusions. Even Trump critics who portray him as an aspiring Nazi tyrant contribute to an erosion of the record about some of humanity\u2019s most heinous crimes. And as extreme as a second Trump term might be, the Nazi Germany comparison feels extreme. Analogies to the autocratic rule and democratic dismantling taking place under his friend, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, seem more on point. The casual proliferation of Nazi references is especially troubling at a moment when echoes of the 1930s are everywhere. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine recalls Hitler\u2019s European expansionism. Israel has just suffered the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, in the October 7 Hamas terror attacks. And there\u2019s been an upsurge of antisemitism in the United States. Anti-Jewish hate has infiltrated some pro-Palestinian protests initially motivated by anger over the civilian carnage of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Some of Trump\u2019s GOP allies have highlighted some antisemitic incidents on college campuses to distract from Trump\u2019s past use of antisemitic tropes, including his attacks on American Jews who vote Democrat and his implications they have dual loyalties to the US and Israel. The rising use of both Nazi innuendo and antisemitism suggest a troubling trend \u2014 the receding of the lessons of World War II and the Holocaust. The public\u2019s collective memory is fading as the Baby Boomers who grew up in the shadow of their parents\u2019 exploits in the 1940s Greatest Generation also begin to pass on. Anyone who admires Hitler and his murderous cult would do well to walk through the preserved death camps, gas chambers and mass crematoria in Eastern Europe where Nazis exterminated the continent\u2019s Jews. And those who carelessly peddle Nazi-themed rhetoric should visit the cliffs of Normandy, where Biden is expected next month to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day amid rows of buried US and Allied soldiers who perished as part of the cost of eradicating fascism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-nazi-allusions-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_biden-campaign-trump-trial", "text": "Biden campaign officials have no idea what next week will bring in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial in New York \u2013 including whether the former president will be convicted or found not guilty or whether the whole saga will ultimately end in a mistrial. But regardless of precisely how the weeks-long historic trial ends, President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is preparing to enter its next, more aggressive phase. On everything from the ads the campaign runs to the messaging and rhetoric that comes from the president himself to growing the campaign\u2019s infrastructure, a person familiar with the campaign\u2019s thinking said, the Biden team recognizes that once the Trump trial \u2013 and the aggressive media coverage of it \u2013 is over, there will be more room and opportunities to make their case to the American people ahead of November. Biden campaign officials are still grappling with the reality, this person said, that a substantial part of the population still doesn\u2019t see that the choice on Election Day will be between Biden and Trump. And while the campaign will need to calibrate its messaging and strategy based on how exactly Trump\u2019s trial ends, this person insisted that at the end of the day, the thrust of their case against the former president won\u2019t change \u2013 whether Trump emerges a convicted felon or not. As CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0on Friday, the Biden campaign on Friday effectively launched the start of that next phase by releasing a scorching new ad called \u201cSnapped,\u201d narrated by actor Robert De Niro. \u201cWe knew Trump was out of control when he was president,\u201d De Niro says over a shot of Trump behind the Resolute Desk. \u201cThen he lost the 2020 election and snapped.\u201d The ad describes Trump as \u201cdesperately\u201d trying to cling to power while showing images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The phrases \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201cterminate the Constitution\u201d flash on screen, followed by a clip of Trump saying, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath.\u201d It\u2019s a message echoed by campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, who wrote in a memo released Friday that the campaign is ready to go deeper on Trump\u2019s rhetoric ahead of next month\u2019s debate on CNN. \u201cIn the month leading up to that first debate, the Biden-Harris campaign will zero in on Trump\u2019s dangerous campaign promises and unhinged rhetoric. We will make sure that the voters who will decide this election are reminded of the chaos and harm Trump caused as president \u2013 and why they booted him out four years ago,\u201d she wrote. That month will be busy for Biden \u2013 the president has two multi-day trips to Europe \u2013 one to commemorate D-Day and one for the annual G-7 summit \u2013\u00a0as well as a fundraising swing to California. The key moments that the campaign has identified are the anniversary of the Dobbs Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and took away the federal right to an abortion and the anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, in which 49 people were killed \u2013 \u201ca tragedy to any normal person, but to Trump just something we should all just \u2018get over,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote. Closing arguments in the Trump trial are set for next week and the jury will receive its instructions from the judge overseeing the case before deliberation begins. There is not an exact time frame for when the jury will make its decision.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_biden-trump-debate-prep", "text": "Two presidents have never debated before. And neither of these two presidents has debated anyone in almost four years \u2014 not since the last time they faced each other. Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are confident\u00a0they can take the other down in next month\u2019s CNN debate,\u00a0people who\u2019ve\u00a0spoken to them said, and each camp is convinced the other\u2019s\u00a0diminishment from four years ago will be\u00a0overwhelming to\u00a0voters\u00a0throughout\u00a090 minutes of live TV. Both believe the debate could move the needle for that thin\u00a0slice\u00a0of\u00a0undecided\u00a0voters who don\u2019t like either candidate and are primed to\u00a0oppose whoever comes across worse. But Biden and Trump are\u00a0gearing up in very different ways. Between\u00a0the president\u2019s\u00a0two multi-day trips scheduled for Europe to commemorate D-Day and for the annual G-7 summit and a fundraising swing to California, Biden aides have plans for extensive prep sessions that will likely include a sequestered stretch, possibly at Camp David. Trump\u2019s advisers, however, insist there have been no formal conversations about preparation for next month\u2019s debate, particularly with the candidate himself.\u00a0Trump, who is facing the end of his\u00a0hush money criminal trial in New York next week and waiting for a verdict, has several events and a California fundraising swing of his own planned. Biden aides believe the president\u2019s task on stage will be straightforward: both needling and taunting Trump, and repeatedly calling on his opponent to answer and explain comments he\u2019s made and positions he has taken. They argue they\u2019re set up to keep capitalizing on how they cornered the former president into agreeing to a debate on their terms, format and timeline, and much of what Biden will do is try to leverage that into confronting Trump. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon,\u00a0the chair of the Biden reelection campaign,\u00a0said that \u201cultimately it doesn\u2019t matter how Trump responds.\u201d \u201cWe make no bones about the fact that the more people see the choice, the better it is for us, the more people feel and hear him, see the crazy\u00a0stuff\u00a0he says,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThese [debates] are\u00a0two moments that the president can stand next to Donald Trump and show the strength of his leadership and show there\u2019s just one choice here who can actually deliver for people.\u201d No level of preparation or rehearsed lines can cover for those\u00a0positions,\u00a0Biden aides said, and even if they don\u2019t get the wild-swinging responses they\u2019re fantasizing about, \u201cthe problem for [Trump] is there is no substantive answer to these questions that the American people are going to agree with,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said. Trump aides, meanwhile, said formal practice sessions are unlikely, with Trump\u2019s run-up to the debate likely to look very different from the standard. Though they acknowledge plans may change \u2014 and that any change would have to come from Trump himself \u2014 they said, as of now, there will not be someone playing Biden, they will not hit\u00a0the former president\u00a0with tough questions, and they will not have him practice engaging with moderators. More likely, they said, will be a series of meetings and conversations with close advisers. Trump\u2019s less structured preparation more suits his freewheeling style, they said, while they\u2019re also being careful to avoid setting the bar too low for Biden even as the former president frequently attacks his Democratic rival\u2019s fitness for office. Biden\u2019s performance at his State of the Union address \u2014 which went over largely well and led to many public reconsiderations of whether he was too diminished to run for a second term \u2014 is very much on the minds of some Trump aides. They expect that Biden\u2019s team will get him into similar shape ahead of the debate. \u201cThe American people are unhappy with his administration, and he will have to answer for three years of bad policies,\u201d one\u00a0Trump\u00a0adviser told CNN. A key date on the calendar Biden\u2019s campaign is using the June 27 debate as an organizing directive, with two main dates on the calendar in the lead up. First up will be\u00a0June 12, the day in 2016 when 49 people were killed in a mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando by a man with the kind of automatic rifle Biden has been pushing to ban. Then will be\u00a0June 24, the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u00a0decision that struck down Roe v. Wade. That next phase will begin with a new ad releasing Friday, narrated by Robert De Niro, hitting some of what the Biden campaign believes are their strongest points. \u201cWe knew Trump was out of control when he was president,\u201d De Niro says over a shot of Trump behind the Resolute Desk. \u201cThen he lost the 2020 election and snapped.\u201d The ad describes him as \u201cdesperately\u201d trying to cling to power while showing images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The phrases \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201cterminate the Constitution\u201d flash on screen, followed by a clip of Trump saying, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath.\u201d To Biden aides, talking about Trump having \u201csnapped\u201d is continuing to set the terms of the face off, even before they get to the debate stage. Trolling Trump, they said, doesn\u2019t just increase the likelihood that it will set off the former president; it\u2019s what they need to rev up the disenchanted in their own base who are struggling to get excited for Biden but can never get enough of hating Trump. But multiple prominent Democrats said they worry Biden can\u2019t come off as robust next to Trump. They live a daily nightmare imagining some kind of trip up, literal or verbal, that becomes the one Biden can\u2019t come back from, and\u00a0they think\u00a0the debate stage seems like the obvious place where this\u00a0could\u00a0happen. Back in 2020, as Biden and his close advisers were trying to figure out what he would be facing in the presidential debates, top aide Anita Dunn reached out for some insight to Anthony Scaramucci, the finance executive who famously spent 11 days as Trump\u2019s communications director before being fired and then turning hard against his former boss. These days, Biden and his team feel like they have Trump pegged to the point that they\u2019re laying out much of what they want to talk about, and how, in a memo they will circulate to reporters on Friday, over a month ahead of when the lights go on in Atlanta. Trump aides, however, said they\u2019re not worried, and neither is Trump,\u00a0people who have spoken to him said. They believe formats and calendars can\u2019t change issues like immigration and the economy that they think are dominating the race and certainly can\u2019t change how Biden comes off on camera. Biden and Trump have both struggled in debate prep before Biden savors going after Republicans much more than he ever liked going after fellow Democrats during many stumbling primary debate performances in 2019 and 2020. But \u201csprawling\u201d is a word often associated with Biden prep. People who have been in previous debate preps sessions with him said they can be exhausting and, for long stretches, not productive. He prefers sitting around a table covered in policy binders, trying to explain himself in long answers in ways that he feels like he hasn\u2019t gotten to do and asking whoever he can make eye contact with, \u201cHow would you do it?\u201d Much of the work goes into focusing him, these people who have been in prep with him said, pulling him back to the key point or narrative that aides have identified. Biden does not like mock debates, according to people who were involved with those sessions. Staffers built podiums for him to use in prep in 2020 and he would stand at his occasionally, but he likes the feeling of preserving some fresh energy for the night itself. Last time around, though, aides kept making him face his Trump stand-in \u2014 Bob Bauer, the lawyer for his campaign who has since represented Biden in several matters, including being in the deposition for the classified documents investigation that produced the special counsel report in February. Over and over, Bauer would go at Biden with vicious attacks about his son Hunter and his family, trying to numb Biden to even worse comments than they expected Trump might dare to make. This worked well enough, Biden 2020 campaign aides argued, that it set Biden up for one of his more lauded moments four years ago, when he responded to Trump\u2019s attacks on his son with a firm but emotional statement about families like his that have struggled with addiction. Ron Klain, Democrats\u2019 most experienced presidential debate coach and former Biden chief of staff, is expected to be involved again this time, but multiple people in the Biden circle also point to longtime adviser and current deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed as being key this time. With Dunn, O\u2019Malley Dillon and fellow aides Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon, the rest of Biden\u2019s core political team that prepped him four years ago remains largely in place. The only main ones likely to be missing are adviser Antony Blinken, who is now secretary of state, and former communications director and deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield, who has left the White House and is now a CNN contributor, while former policy director Jake Sullivan is now the national security adviser. As for Trump, several people who participated in his debate preparations in 2016 and 2020 say it was often hard to keep him focused. Practice sessions would often devolve. His team this time around is substantially different. Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, the two top aides on this year\u2019s campaign, were not involved in his 2020 prep. Catching Covid-19 during debate prep and being hospitalized was the beginning of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s turn against the former president, and he has made abundantly clear during his 2024 GOP primary run and since that he does not want to be anywhere near Trump this time. Rudy Giuliani, who was also frequently at the White House in those days, has largely been sidelined and is busy with his own indictments.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_nikki-haley-biden-trump", "text": "A Biden campaign official met Wednesday night with\u00a0Nikki Haley\u00a0supporters from across several states in a pre-scheduled Zoom call hours after the former Republican presidential candidate said\u00a0she would be voting\u00a0for Donald Trump, two sources familiar with the call told CNN. The meeting was part of an ongoing effort by the Biden campaign to reach out to Haley voters. It was organized by the Haley Voters Working Group. Conservative Haley backers from Virginia, Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Florida, Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina joined the call, including members of Haley\u2019s former state leadership teams and the organization\u00a0Women for Nikki. The call, which one source characterized as a constructive initial step, began with a Q&A session for about 35 minutes with the Biden campaign official, who wanted to know which policy issues were most important to the Haley supporters. Another source confirmed that the official on the call was Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, the deputy political director for President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. After Pe\u00f1alosa left the call, the source said the conversation continued among the group, with a \u201cfew moments of mourning\u201d over Haley\u2019s decision to back Trump along with a recognition that it wasn\u2019t a full-throated endorsement. \u201cTrump would be\u00a0smart\u00a0to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d\u00a0Haley\u00a0said Wednesday at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington. Robert Schwartz, the executive director of the Haley Voters Working Group, said that despite the disappointment over the former South Carolina governor saying she would vote for Trump, there was an understanding that this was a choice she was likely to make. \u201cA lot of these people in this group are big supporters of Nikki Haley and want to support her in 2028,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re legit Republicans and conservatives, and so they don\u2019t want to see Trump destroy the party.\u201d As some Republican voters continue to show support for Haley in primaries since she left the presidential race in March, the Biden campaign is focused on expanding its outreach and talking to these voters, especially in battleground states. The campaign stressed to CNN that this is part of a larger outreach program targeting GOP voters, which will include dedicated staff and grassroots-driven efforts as the general election approaches. The campaign issued a press release Thursday afternoon entitled \u201cTo Haley Voters: There\u2019s a Home For You on Team Biden-Harris.\u201d \u201cWhile Donald Trump continues to attack moderate Republican and independent voters, the Biden campaign is investing to talk to these voters and working to earn their support,\u201d the release read. Schwartz concurred with that sentiment. \u201cWhile Trump has done absolutely nothing to gain the support of Haley voters and takes them for granted, Biden and his campaign are actively reaching out to build a coalition of Republicans and they know they need to earn their vote. We welcome their initial engagements and know they plan to do much more in the coming months,\u201d he said. On the call Wednesday, the Haley voters raised some of their pressing policy concerns with Pe\u00f1alosa, including the southern border, Ukraine and Israel. Amanda Stewart Sprowls, a Haley supporter from Arizona, expressed a desire for an executive order or some type of strong action from Biden to address the US-Mexico border. The Daily Beast\u00a0was first to report\u00a0on the Zoom call. Haley supporters say what it would take to earn their vote Describing herself as \u201cpolitically homeless,\u201d Alissa Baker, of Ashburn, Virginia, who was on Haley\u2019s Virginia leadership team, told CNN she\u2019s undecided and looking at all her options, including Biden. Baker heard the initial message from Biden that there\u2019s a place for Haley voters in his campaign. The call with Pe\u00f1alosa, she said, was the start of a conversation and an opportunity for him to express what that really means. \u201cDon\u2019t keep telling us, \u2018Democracy is on the ballot,\u2019 like, we get it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe get that Trump\u2019s a problem. Like, you don\u2019t have to tell us, you know, so we wanted to move past that and have that substantive discussion.\u201d Asked what it would take for the Trump campaign to earn her vote, Baker said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that they think they have to earn our vote.\u201d \u201cI think that they assume that we\u2019ll just come home, which is a very bad assumption,\u201d she added. Chris Rauen of Paradise, California, is a former Haley supporter who was also on the call. He identifies as a Reagan Republican and is leaning toward Biden right now. To earn his vote, Rauen told CNN he wants the Biden campaign to \u201cmove a little bit more to the center\u201d on some foreign policy issues and \u201chear less of the raising of taxes.\u201d Rauen was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d when he heard Haley say that she is voting for Trump. Stewart Sprowls \u2013 a lifelong Republican, business owner and mom of three \u2013 is concerned about employment, criminal activity in border states and the \u201creal threat\u201d of fentanyl in Arizona. \u201cWe need Biden to deliver on centrist policy over the next six months, and an executive order to close the border would go a long way,\u201d she added. As for Trump, Stewart Sprowls said at this point she is not voting for him. \u201cHe has not reached out to Haley Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not agree with Trump\u2019s populist economic policies and his divisiveness. I also strongly disagree with Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_elections-washoe-county-nevada", "text": "In the Washoe County elections office, everyone is new to the job. Cari-Ann Burgess \u2013 the top elections official in the county \u2013 is the third registrar of voters there in just four years. She\u2019s been leading the office for less than six months. Her deputy, Andrew McDonald, has been on the job for a few weeks. Media production specialist George Guthrie started less than nine months ago. Even Noah Autrey, the office assistant, started full-time less than a year ago. With 100% staff turnover since the last presidential election, Washoe County is emblematic of a nationwide trend. States are gearing up for the 2024 election while grappling with an election worker exodus driven by the complexity of the job, as well as threats and harassment, experts say. Election worker turnover has been ticking up steadily over the past two decades, but the pace has increased in recent cycles.\u00a0Since 2020, at least 36% of local election officials have left the job, according to researchers from the Bipartisan Policy Center and the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe know that an unsafe work environment is a big consideration for election officials when they leave their roles,\u201d said Rachel Orey, a senior associate director of the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s elections project. \u201cThreats and harassment are one of the many factors that lead to turnover.\u201d Burgess has quit before too. She worked on elections in her home state of Minnesota in 2020, until the stress became too overwhelming. On a grocery store run with her children, a constituent started screaming at her, prompting Burgess to abandon her cart and leave the store. \u201cMy daughters were visibly shaken when that happened,\u201d Burgess recalled. \u201cI was shaking because I was so upset that somebody would have the audacity to do that to me in a grocery store in front of my children.\u201d Burgess soon traded irate voters for sunsets in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, where she took a job managing a friend\u2019s beachfront ice cream shop. \u201cIt was just the mental break that I needed,\u201d Burgess said. She handpicked which ice cream flavors to order, managed a gaggle of teenage staff and walked along the pier, spotting dolphins and leatherback sea turtles. \u201cI never expected to go back to elections. Never,\u201d she said. But the career shift didn\u2019t take. \u201cI love this country. I love elections. It\u2019s who I am,\u201d Burgess said, tearing up. \u201cI had to come back.\u201d She had been working in elections in Nevada for about nine months when she was chosen to lead election administration in the state\u2019s second-largest county. Her appointment to interim registrar generated an icy response. Constituents filed up to the microphone at the county commissioners meeting in mid-January. Then they let it rip \u2013 questioning Burgess\u2019 resume, suggesting she got the job because she has \u201cfriends in high places\u201d and denouncing her hiring as \u201cshady, shady, shady.\u201d It was a wave of familiar faces, perhaps none more familiar than real estate investor and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Robert Beadles. \u201cNow you have this Cari-Ann, she may be the nicest gal in the world, but she\u2019s certainly not qualified to be our registrar of voters,\u201d Beadles told the commissioners. Beadles \u2013 who backs former President Donald Trump and describes himself as a constitutionalist \u2013 has devoted significant time and money spreading the kind of election skepticism that ballooned nationwide after Trump\u2019s baseless claims of fraud in 2020. Nevada\u2019s critical battleground Washoe County \u2013 home to Reno, \u201cThe Biggest Little City in the World\u201d \u2013 is the critical battleground county within the battleground state. In presidential elections, whoever wins the county tends to win the state. The county has broken for Democrats in the past four presidential races, sometimes narrowly. As the number of registered voters in the county has grown, and voters have gained easier access to the ballot box, running elections there has also become more complicated. In 2021, the state permanently expanded mail-in voting, requiring clerks to send every active registered voter a ballot before the primary and general elections. An audit of the 2022 midterm elections in Washoe highlighted the pitfalls when an expanded election workload and a new workforce collide. The audit determined that the office was understaffed and inexperienced, leading to poor communication with constituents and expensive errors, although none that affected the election results, including for Senate, House and governor. The audit noted that the \u201ccollective inexperience and lack of institutional knowledge\u201d led to ballot errors that required a costly ballot reprint. Since the audit, the registrar\u2019s office staffed up, bringing on Burgess and others, and workers have gone through additional training. The office added additional cameras and a floor-to-ceiling glass observation booth for election observers \u2013 steps to improve transparency and to protect employees. After the stress she experienced in 2020 \u2013 waking up in the middle of the night, losing patches of hair \u2013 Burgess is on a personal mission to protect her staff from the same kind of burnout. She\u2019s urging them to get enough sleep, use their vacation days and take advantage of mental health resources in the run-up to November. \u201cI\u2019m like, you guys, this is a piece cake right now,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna get worse.\u201d The audit also noted that \u201ca skeptical portion of the public is demanding more information so they can understand election administration.\u201d Burgess said she has an \u201copen-door policy\u201d if members of the community want her to walk them through the process. Her team also rearranged the ballot counting area so election observers can see more of the machinery directly rather than on the livestream from video cameras. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do everything possible to make sure that anybody who observes can see every part of our election process,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cNothing nefarious is going on here.\u201d New law to protect election workers The clean sweep of the election office staff and other changes have done little to sway the county\u2019s chief election skeptic. \u201cThey\u2019re literally just counting everything behind closed doors and come out and tell you who wins. How do you trust that?\u201d Beadles told CNN in an interview. Asked about the observation areas available to election observers, Beadles dismissed it as \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d Beadles campaigned for the removal of the two previous registrars, one of whom specifically cited threats and harassment as a reason for leaving. Beadles took aim at another prior registrar, accusing her of treason and telling commissioners, \u201cEither fire her or lock her up.\u201d Last year, Nevada\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a law \u2013 signed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo \u2013 making it a felony to harass or intimidate election workers with the goal of interfering in their work or retaliating against them, punishable by up to four years in prison. Beadles \u2013 who says he has never harassed an election official \u2013 has been battling against the law ever since, calling it \u201celection suppression.\u201d \u201cWhen you read it, you\u2019ll see that if you just simply asked an election worker why they did what they did, if that just slows them down from their job, that could get you four years in jail, you know that?\u201d Beadles said. \u201cIf you simply said, \u2018Well, why did you sort that ballot? Or why didn\u2019t you check that signature?\u2019 They can give you four years in jail for that.\u201d That\u2019s not how Burgess sees it. The new election law, she said, is another tool to keep her staff safe from threatening behavior, not criticism \u2013 and, she hopes, to help her retain staff beyond this election season. \u201cI have told them, and I\u2019m going to continue to tell them, that if somebody\u2019s yelling at you just walk away, just be nice,\u201d Burgess said. But if staffers are being threatened with physical harm, \u201cyou go ahead and you report that,\u201d she said. Reports nationwide, as well as locally, have documented escalating threats against election workers. But Beadles doesn\u2019t buy it, arguing Nevada\u2019s new law is unnecessary. \u201cNobody\u2019s harassed or intimidated or assaulted any of these people,\u201d he said. Asked about Beadles\u2019 refusal to believe that harassment even takes place, Burgess appeared unsurprised. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you feel like that, that you believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cI was one who lived it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/elections-washoe-county-nevada/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_economy-better-off-readers-response", "text": "The US is in an odd spot right now. By many metrics, the economy is doing well, but polls show that lots of Americans aren\u2019t feeling it. CNN designed its own quiz to ask readers whether they are better off now, under President Joe Biden, or whether things were better for them under former President Donald Trump, the two leading candidates who will square off in November\u2019s election. We prompted readers to consider whether they feel safer, happier, freer and healthier, in addition to in a better position economically, and to tell us why. You can take the quiz here. A majority of quiz respondents said they do feel better off now than when Biden took office in 2021, though a sizeable share said their personal situation had not improved.The reasons they gave varied widely, from their finances to their sense of personal safety to their concerns about America\u2019s standing in the world. Looking at a representative sample of more than 10,000 responses, one concern that featured prominently was readers\u2019 view that Trump\u2019s first term was marked by uncertainty and chaos. They wrote of persistent anxiety that Trump was fostering division, eroding democracy and alienating allies, though they said they felt calmer with Biden in the White House. Quiz takers also voiced concerns about rising prices, crime and the loss of personal freedoms. Here are four factors that multiple readers said shaped their views: Higher investments and wages Though costs are higher, the stock market has been on a tear. The S&P 500 is up more than a third since Biden took office. And wages have outpaced inflation since the middle of last year. Multiple quiz takers noted that they were feeling flusher thanks to the hot stock market and strong job market. Steep inflation Prices have skyrocketed during the Biden administration, and while the rate of inflation has slowed, costs remain high. Polls show that inflation is one of Americans\u2019 main financial concerns. Some quiz respondents wrote of feeling the same way.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_biden-trump-campaign-season-analysis", "text": "Labor Day traditionally heralds the final push for presidential campaigns, but a frenetic, compressed calendar this year means the critical marker is the holiday that signals the start of summer rather than the one that marks its end. Monday\u2019s Memorial Day holiday will be a prelude to a bitter season of politics with a neck-and-neck presidential election already looking almost certain to come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states. The heat will be even more intense because the clash between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will for only the second time ever see two presidents each dueling for a second term. The unprecedented nature of the 2024 race will be immediately underscored on Tuesday when Trump returns to the Manhattan courtroom where he is facing his first criminal trial. He is accused of falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. (He\u2019s pleaded not guilty and denied the alleged affair with the actress.) After a monthlong trial, lawyers for both sides will crystalize their cases in closing summations before the judge hands the jury the historic task of deciding for the first time whether an ex-president and presumptive nominee will be convicted of a crime. It remains unclear how a conviction or an acquittal would reverberate in a polarized nation during a presidential race that has been remarkably stable with neither candidate able to break away. Would the historic stain of a felony conviction for Trump further alienate the critical suburban swing-state voters who may decide the election? Or has Trump been so successful in spreading his narrative that he\u2019s a victim of politically motivated prosecutions that the impact of a guilty verdict would be neutralized? The former president would almost certainly use an acquittal to argue that his other three criminal indictments are baseless. And with those cases unlikely to come to trial before November\u2019s election, a campaign intertwined with Trump\u2019s legal problems would suddenly look more like a traditional election \u2014 albeit one featuring the most unorthodox ex-president of modern times, who tried to overturn democracy after losing the last election to Biden. As soon as the verdict is announced in New York, attention will switch to the unusually early first presidential debate at the end of June on CNN. Biden, who has been consistently a little behind in swing-state polls, has a strong interest in an earlier-than-usual head-to-head confrontation that could change the momentum in the race. The president also wants Americans to tune into Trump\u2019s wild, anti-democratic personality and focus on how extreme a second term that his rival has said he\u2019d devote to retribution would be. While presidential debates have traditionally been in the fall, the growing prevalence of early and mail-in voting is a reason to shift debates earlier. A second presidential debate has been scheduled for September on ABC, and while Trump is pushing for more one-on-one showdowns with Biden, the president\u2019s campaign is resisting his demands. Biden seizes on new abortion controversy to discomfort Trump With the Trump trial on hold ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, Thursday brought a preview of how the rest of the campaign might unfold. Biden argued that a new bill approved by Louisiana lawmakers that would classify abortion-inducing drugs as controlled dangerous substances was a \u201cdirect result of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade.\u201d He was referring to the conservative Supreme Court majority that Trump built that eradicated the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. \u201cThis is a scary time for women across America. If Donald Trump regains power, he will try to make what is happening in states like Louisiana a reality nationwide,\u201d Biden said. Abortion is one of the few issues where polls show Biden enjoys higher public approval than Trump, and Democrats are counting on it driving up their turnout at a moment when there are serious questions about the durability of Biden\u2019s electoral coalition. The former president has waffled on abortion and his latest position that decisions on the issue should be left to the states does little to protect him politically every time a conservative state or judge takes a hardline anti-abortion position. Another of the key developments to watch this summer will be whether the ex-president is able to maintain what some polls suggest is an unusually strong position for a Republican among minority voters. Biden is taking urgent steps to shore up his support in communities that usually vote overwhelmingly Democrat. He, for instance, issued two new ads on Thursday implicitly accusing Trump of being a racist, recalling the former president\u2019s call for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of minority teenagers falsely accused of beating and raping a woman in New York\u2019s Central Park in the 1980s. The ads also reminded voters about Trump\u2019s racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. The Trump campaign accused Biden of trying to \u201cgaslight Black voters\u201d and highlighted Biden\u2019s support as a senator for a 1990s crime bill that raised incarceration rates for Black Americans. In what was billed as an attempt to reach out to Black and Hispanic voters, the former president held a rally in the Bronx on Thursday, in a rare visit for a Republican to one of the country\u2019s most Democratic counties. The former president used the opportunity to argue that minorities were suffering because of what he claims is out-of-control migration \u2014 the issue at the core of his campaign. \u201cThese millions and millions of people that are coming into our country, the biggest impact and the biggest negative impact is against our Black population and our Hispanic population, who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s event followed a visit by Biden to Morehouse College \u2014 the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 in Georgia last weekend in which he took implicit aim at Trump and his right-wing supporters, warning that when \u201cold ghosts in new garments seize power, extremists come for the freedoms you thought belonged to you and everyone.\u201d Biden has multiple vulnerabilities Biden also used his Moorehouse speech to try and insulate himself from another of his vulnerabilities heading into the final months of the campaign \u2014 the fury among young and progressive voters about his support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians. \u201cThis is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was working around the clock for a ceasefire and toward the distant prospect of a Palestinian state. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about it. I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family.\u00a0But most of all, I know it breaks your heart.\u00a0It breaks mine as well.\u201d But on Thursday, the president was given a reminder of the backlash against America\u2019s Israel policies with the eruption of another protest like the ones that have rattled college campuses across the country. Demonstrators chanted \u201cdivest now!\u201d as they demanded UCLA pull out of any investments linked to Israel in a largely peaceful protest in Los Angeles. Any large-scale resumption of protests in the run-up to the election, or at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, could play into Trump\u2019s hands as he claims that law and order is spinning out of control under Biden and would raise further questions about the president\u2019s capacity to achieve strong support from younger and more progressive voters. Biden badly needs the war in Gaza to ease over the summer, but there is no sign that Netanyahu is willing to heed his calls for a lowering of the conflict\u2019s intensity. The president will also be hoping this summer for the cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve that he has long predicted would come and that could give some relief to Americans weary of the cost of homes and vehicles and high prices at supermarkets. The financial crunch has hollowed out Biden\u2019s reputation for economic management despite robust growth and low unemployment and offered Trump an advantage on the issue that decides most US elections. The former president has been creating an idealized vision of the economy during his term, before the Covid-19 pandemic caused a crash. \u201cThe costs have gone up so much,\u201d Trump said in the Bronx. \u201cI don\u2019t eat bacon anymore, it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d the billionaire former real estate tycoon said. Inflation has fallen substantially \u2014 to 3.4% year on year last month \u2014 well below 40-year highs after the pandemic. But many Americans have yet to see the impact in their wallets \u2014 one reason why Trump has an advantage on the perennial election question when voters ask themselves whether they are better off than they were four years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/biden-trump-campaign-season-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The top US diplomat said the new tranche of assistance \u201ccontains urgently needed capabilities\u201d for Ukrainian troops as they fight to hold back Russia\u2019s advances toward the key northeastern city. \u201cWe will move this new assistance as quickly as possible so the Ukrainian military can use it to defend their territory and protect the Ukrainian people,\u201d Blinken said in a statement. In a post on X Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his gratitude for the new aid package, saying it \u201cis critical right now, as the enemy intensifies attacks along the frontline.\u201d \u201cToday in Kharkiv, I witnessed firsthand the importance of strengthening our warriors in order to protect our people, our cities, and our communities. Freedom is the value both of our nations hold dear. To protect it, we require continued strong support from the United States and other allies,\u201d Zelensky wrote. Russian forces have advanced toward Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, after launching a surprise cross-border assault in mid-May. Seven people were killed in a barrage of Russian missile strikes Thursday. Ukrainian forces have been forced to contend with weapons shortfalls as they fight to hold off the advances. CNN journalists in the town\u00a0of Lyptsi, around 20 miles north of Kharkiv city, saw troops using aging and inadequate weaponry, in an attempt to repel highly equipped Russian units bolstered by drones. The latest US military assistance package \u2013 the fifth since the passage of a multi-billion dollar national security funding package \u2013 includes artillery rounds, Javelin and TOW missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), demolitions munitions, anti-armor mines, tactical vehicles, and body armor, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear protective equipment, Blinken said. The top US diplomat traveled to Ukraine last week to reaffirm the US\u2019 support to Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials after the passage of that national security supplemental. \u201cWe are determined that Ukraine win this war and succeed for its people and for its future,\u201d Blinken said at a press conference alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to making sure that Ukraine has the equipment it needs to succeed on the battlefield.\u201d However, the US has continued to say its weapons cannot be used by Ukraine to strike Russian targets on Russian territory. \u201cWe have not encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine,\u201d Blinken reiterated last week. Meanwhile, G7 finance ministers are meeting in Italy to discuss plans to marshal Russian assets that were frozen overseas at the outset of the war toward Ukraine\u2019s defense and reconstruction, according to people familiar with the matter. The plan, if finalized, would see US and European banks redirect tens of billions of dollars in proceeds from Russian investments toward Ukraine \u2013 providing a critical financial lifeline as the continued political wherewithal by Ukraine\u2019s major benefactors remains uncertain.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_senators-trudeau-letter-defense-spending", "text": "A bipartisan group of\u00a023\u00a0US senators\u00a0have written\u00a0to Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0urging\u00a0his country\u00a0to live up to its commitment\u00a0to spend 2% of GDP on defense amid\u00a0concerns\u00a0that key members of the NATO alliance are not pulling their weight. \u201cAs we approach the 2024 NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., we are concerned and profoundly disappointed that Canada\u2019s most recent projection indicated that it will not reach its two percent commitment this decade,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cIn 2029, Canada\u2019s defense spending is estimated to rise to just 1.7 percent, five years after the agreed upon deadline of 2024 and still below the spending baseline.\u201d The rare letter from lawmakers to a head of state comes about two months before NATO\u2019s next annual summit in Washington, DC, which will mark the alliance\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary\u00a0as Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine continues. At last year\u2019s leader-level summit, the allies agreed that each member nation should spend at least\u00a02% of its GDP on defense. The senators pointed to that agreement in making their case for Canada to live up to the commitment. And the senators\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including Republicans Mitt Romney of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas as well as Democrats Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, among others \u2014\u00a0argued that if Canada falls short of its commitment, it will hurt\u00a0NATO. \u201cCanada will fail to meet its obligations to the Alliance, to the detriment of all NATO Allies and the free world, without immediate and meaningful action to increase defense spending,\u201d the senators\u00a0wrote. Canada is a founding member of the defensive alliance, which now has 32 member nations. The senators noted the contributions Canada has made to\u00a0NATO on multiple fronts, including taking a leading role in support of\u00a0its military operations and developing standards around democracy, economic resilience and human rights. But the senators also pointed out that many other nations are taking the necessary steps to hit and exceed\u00a0the 2% target. \u201cBy the end of 2024, 18 NATO countries will meet the Alliance\u2019s goal to ensure NATO\u2019s continued military readiness. This is a historic investment in our collective security, led by NATO Allies like Poland, a country that has already exceeded three percent of its GDP for defense spending,\u201d they wrote. Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair responded to the letter on Thursday by saying that \u201cCanada is on a very strong upward trajectory in defense spending,\u201d adding \u201cwe know we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d Blair did not offer a specific timeline for when the country plans to hit the 2% commitment. \u201cOur work has begun but there\u2019s a great deal of work to do. It\u2019s really important that when we\u2019re spending hard earned Canadian taxpayers dollars that we spend them well,\u201d he said. Earlier this year,\u00a0NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that he expects Canada to \u201cdeliver on the pledge\u201d or else details plans for reaching the target spending. More than a dozen\u00a0other NATO members \u2014 including Spain, Turkey and the Netherlands \u2014have also so far fallen short of the alliance\u2019s target. But the senators chose to write to Trudeau because\u00a0they believe Canada \u2014\u00a0unlike other nations\u00a0\u2014  does not appear to have a plan in place to hit the target, a congressional aide explained. While the letter does not mention former President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump, the\u00a0presumptive\u00a0GOP presidential nominee has had a real impact on the ongoing efforts to get alliance members to spend\u00a0more. During his presidency Trump\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0pressed\u00a0members to contribute more to the alliance,\u00a0and to spend more on defense spending overall. Europeans are also concerned about what Trump might do in a possible second term when it comes to NATO. If he wins the election in November, Trump\u00a0will consider pushing for a two-tier NATO, CNN\u00a0has previously reported.\u00a0That would mean countries that\u00a0don\u2019t meet the\u00a02% of\u00a0GDP\u00a0spending\u00a0commitment would not be protected by NATO\u2019s Article 5, which guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance can be used to protect any single member nation if it\u2019s attacked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/senators-trudeau-letter-defense-spending/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "The political calculation has changed again for Nikki Haley. Not long ago, the former South Carolina governor was arguing that Donald Trump was too old, too chaotic, too \u201cunhinged\u201d and too prone to temper tantrums to be president again and said he couldn\u2019t beat President Joe Biden. \u201cI feel no need to kiss the ring,\u201d Haley said in February before suspending her primary campaign.\u00a0\u201cMy political future is of no concern.\u201d But on Wednesday, she delivered the implicit endorsement everyone knew was coming sooner or later. Haley said that while Trump had not been \u201cperfect\u201d on issues that matter to her, like foreign policy and the national debt, Biden had been a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo, I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said the former US ambassador to the United Nations, who served in the ex-president\u2019s Cabinet. After a friendly photo-op in front of the Oval Office fireplace, she left that job in 2018 before she could be tarnished by association with Trump\u2019s mayhem. As 2024 loomed on the calendar, Haley said she would not run for president against her old boss \u2014 then did so anyway \u2014 to Trump\u2019s lingering fury. Before losing her home state\u2019s primary to Trump earlier this year, Haley lashed out at Republicans who backed Trump despite privately despairing over him. \u201cIn politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. \u2026 Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he\u2019s been and will continue to be for our party. They\u2019re just too afraid to say it out loud.\u201d Now Haley is saying out loud she\u2019s voting for Trump. But she had little choice but to join the herd if she wants a future in a party dominated by its presumptive nominee. It\u2019s the same decision reached by Ted Cruz, whose wife was once publicly humiliated by Trump but who has long since attached himself to the former president. On Wednesday night, the Harvard Law School graduate, who presently represents Texas in the US Senate, refused an invitation by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins to unconditionally accept the forthcoming results of the 2024 election. \u201cLook, if the Democrats win, I will accept the result. But I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d said Cruz, who then, in true Trump fashion, cited baseless claims that the 2020 contest was rife with fraud. There\u2019s not much of a path in the alternative: former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a onetime rising GOP star, became an example of what happens to conservative foreign policy hawks who refuse to temper warnings that Trump is a danger to democracy. Haley seeks to preserve her future There is every sign that Haley wants to run again for president once Trump finally leaves the stage. So repudiating him now would serve no personal political purpose except to end her career on a point of principle. History might applaud her selflessness, but power would likely remain out of her reach. Haley\u2019s move will reinforce an impression that she always adopts the political course most advantageous to her ambitions. But if Biden wins in November, she can say she predicted Trump would lose. If a Trump second term is a disaster, she\u2019s on the record predicting chaos. She could then be positioned to try to lead the GOP back to the pre-Trump positions on foreign policy and the economy that seem closest to her own beliefs, even if she often seemed in 2024 to be auditioning for the leadership of a party that doesn\u2019t exist in any recognizable form. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who has said that Trump should not be let anywhere near the White House again, said he was disappointed by Haley\u2019s decision. \u201cI think she has obviously made a political calculation that it is in her interests to support Donald Trump,\u201d Bolton told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Wednesday. Haley \u2013 who won Vermont and Washington, DC \u2013 is not the only younger GOP presidential candidate with still-burning White House dreams to undergo such a transformation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out at Trump when his own campaign faded in frigid Iowa in January, then endorsed him on the way out of the race far more quickly than Haley did. During her campaign, Haley argued that both Biden, who is 81, and Trump who turns 78 next month, were both too old to be president and called for cognitive tests for candidates over 75. But her decision to focus only on Biden\u2019s liabilities on Wednesday raises the questions of whether her voters will follow her in Trump\u2019s direction. Since she suspended her campaign, tens of thousands of voters in GOP primaries have continued to vote for her. This support is a living legacy of a campaign in which she set herself up as a vessel for Republicans who disdain Trump and wanted another candidate. Haley was especially strong in suburban areas where the ex-president struggles most. And the Biden campaign signaled that it would compete for this bloc of wavering GOP voters in November. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a place for Haley voters in my campaign,\u201d the president said during a fundraiser in the swing state of Georgia over the weekend. However, many Haley voters confided at events in New Hampshire and Iowa earlier this year that though they preferred her, they\u2019d probably stick with their party as loyal Republicans if Trump beat her to the nomination. In that sense, Haley\u2019s decision \u2013 while dripping with political expedience \u2013 may be one that many of her supporters are also wrestling with. The choice for Republicans who dislike Trump and are considering Biden is a more complex question in this election than the previous one. Now, Biden is the incumbent with a list of achievements and policies that directly contradict the core beliefs of many Republicans, including on foreign policy and economics. Memories of the chaos of the Trump administration have also diminished. Traditional national security Republicans may also perceive global war and chaos and Biden\u2019s growing feud with a right-wing Israeli prime minister as a reason not to switch their vote. \u201cA lot of Republicans are making the same calculation because the performance of the Biden administration has been so appalling,\u201d Bolton said. Political ambition behind Haley\u2019s choice Haley said she\u2019d vote for Trump while speaking at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, during her first major political speech since suspending her Republican presidential campaign. Her announcement during a Q&A seemed illogical. She had just delivered a hardline speech melding Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cold War hawkishness with the neoconservative notes of the Bush administration yet was promising to vote for an ex-president who has eviscerated both GOP foreign policy codes with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy. Haley argued that she wanted to vote for a candidate who would have \u201cthe backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account and who would secure the border.\u201d But during his first term, Trump often cozied up to US enemies like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un and spent four years berating US allies in Europe and Asia for freeloading off the United States. Biden, by contrast, has reinvigorated and expanded US alliances, especially NATO, which Trump despises. The Western alliance now has more direction than at any time since the end of the Cold War. And Trump might talk a good game on immigration, but he recently derailed the most conservative border bill in decades, apparently because he wanted to deprive Biden of an election-year win and preserve his narrative of a nation under siege. The tepid nature of Haley\u2019s support for Trump leaves some questions, including whether she will agree to campaign for him and whether she\u2019ll urge her voters to back him. While saying she\u2019d vote for the ex-president, Haley urged him to take steps to reach out to her voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d she said. Trump has made no effort to appeal to Haley voters during the march to the nomination despite his dire need to court suburban voters. And he was quick to knock down reports recently that the former South Carolina governor could be on his shortlist for the vice presidential nomination. But any accommodation between the two political foes would be a reminder that it\u2019s best not to take what happens in presidential primary campaigns too seriously. Haley, after all, went from one extreme to the other during her bid. She spent months offering only the mildest condemnations of Trump, who sought to overturn the 2020 election to stay in power. Like other GOP candidates, she was unable to solve the conundrum of how to run against the ex-president, who is still wildly popular with base voters, while avoiding alienating his supporters. When she did turn fully on Trump amid the snows of New Hampshire, it was as an act of last resort as it became clear she had no route to the nomination. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on February 1, Haley said Trump had experienced some \u201cconfused moments\u201d in prior days and rebuked the ex-president for a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d on the night of his New Hampshire primary win when he tried to push her out of the race. During an appearance in Columbia, South Carolina, Haley asked an audience:\u00a0\u201cDo you really think he is going to win against Joe Biden when he is spending that much on legal fees? He is not.\u201d On February 12, Haley told Tapper that Trump was \u201ccompletely unhinged\u201d and accused the former president of siding with Putin over NATO members. \u201cRightly or wrongly, chaos follows (Trump),\u201d Haley complained at almost every event. \u201cWe have too much division in this country, and too many threats around the world to be sitting in chaos once again.\u201d But that\u2019s the \u201cchaos\u201d she\u2019ll be voting for in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Biden\u2019s DOJ was locked and loaded for deadly force at Mar-a-Lago \u2026\u201d Literal readers of Trump\u2019s message might wonder: Is this a cry for help from physical harm? But everyone should know it is just Trump asking, again, for money. Writing fundraising emails for politicians these days frequently seems like an exercise in clickbait, but alleging a life in danger is something new. It also feels like a twist on the outrageous \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d argument Trump\u2019s lawyer made before the US Supreme Court last month that presidents should, at least in theory, be able to call out a hit on a political rival and not face prosecution. What is Trump talking about? The actual facts of the \u201cauthorized to shoot me\u201d allegation, as reported by CNN, are these: A recently unsealed document outlining the FBI\u2019s procedure for searching Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022 for classified documents included standard language about the \u201cuse of force\u201d in searches. From CNN\u2019s report by Tierney Sneed,\u00a0Katelyn Polantz,\u00a0Holmes Lybrand\u00a0and\u00a0Hannah Rabinowitz: The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. What actually happened? The FBI coordinated the search with the Secret Service and took pains to be as low profile as possible, according to testimony on Capitol Hill last year by Stephen D\u2019Antuono, former FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington field office. \u201cWe made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues,\u201d D\u2019Antuono said. \u201cWe\u2019re not banging down any doors. We weren\u2019t bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.\u201d Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago when the search occurred, and he actually announced the search was occurring with a post to social media. Read CNN\u2019s original report on the search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. Those details don\u2019t fit into the subject line of an email, and they certainly don\u2019t fit Trump\u2019s narrative that he is being persecuted. The more important headline from the unsealed documents, according to CNN\u2019s report from Tuesday, was that a federal judge in Washington, DC, found \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of crimes before Trump was charged with mishandling classified data. The judge, Beryl Howell, cited the discovery of additional documents with classified markings found in Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago bedroom months after the FBI search. Trump is a master sensationalist, so place the email subject line where he says he\u2019s in physical harm within his oeuvre of over-the-top and untrue allegations. How to get people to open fundraising emails The email address where I get fundraising pitches from politicians received seven such messages from Trump on Tuesday. On any given day, there will likely be at least one that is misleading. Like this one from Tuesday: \u201cI\u2019ve made a final decision. What do you think of my VP choice?\u201d (In truth, Trump has not announced who his running mate will be). Other subject lines are pushing merch: \u201cYOU, have you seen my mugshot? I put it on a mug for you.\u201d (In related news, Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is now selling his own brand of coffee.) There are sweepstakes to win trips to Las Vegas and London. (You can enter to win with a $20.24 contribution). Trump\u2019s allegations about the FBI document were not just contained in the fundraising email. In a post to social media, he weaved the \u201cdeadly force\u201d allegation in with other, ongoing complaints: The temperature in his Manhattan criminal trial courtroom was too cold. Trump thinks President Joe Biden is unfit for office, and he thinks Biden\u2019s Cabinet should remove him from the presidency. The social media post looked like this: \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d The truth is that voters will get to weigh in on Biden\u2019s fitness for office. The New York criminal trial judge, Juan Merchan, explained to Trump at trial that raising the thermostat would turn the ice box into an oven. And there\u2019s absolutely no indication whatsoever that anyone in Biden\u2019s Cabinet is now considering or ever has considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. On that last point, the same cannot be said for Trump \u2013 some of whose Cabinet members did discuss but did not act on using the 25th Amendment after the riot at the Capitol in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/donald-trump-fundraising-email-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_us-visa-restrictions-georgia-foreign-agents-bill", "text": "The US State Department is implementing a new visa restriction policy in response to a repressive law and crackdowns on protests in Georgia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday. Blinken, who noted that he hopes the country\u2019s leaders will reconsider the so-called \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill, said the new visa policy would target \u201cindividuals who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members.\u201d \u201cThis includes individuals responsible for suppressing civil society and freedom of peaceful assembly in Georgia through a campaign of violence or intimidation,\u201d he said in a statement. The United States will also launch a review of its bilateral cooperation with Georgia, Blinken added. The move comes nearly a week after Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili vetoed the bill, which would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face fines. The country\u2019s parliament can still overrule her veto by a simple majority. Georgia\u2019s parliament approved the bill on May 14, with 84 lawmakers voting in favor and 30 against, despite widespread opposition in the nation. Georgian Dream, the ruling party that helmed the legislation, has insisted that it promotes transparency and national sovereignty, while critics argue that it is modeled after laws in Russia used to stamp out opposition. \u201cThis law, in its essence and spirit, is fundamentally Russian, contradicting our constitution and all European standards,\u201d Zourabichvili said after vetoing the bill. The European Union has warned the bill would imperil the country\u2019s chances of joining the bloc if it becomes law. Georgia, a small country nestled in the Caucasus Mountains, applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status late last year. The bill has found resistance both in and outside of the country\u2019s parliament. Thousands have marched in the streets of the Georgian capital against the bill. Fights and shouting matches broke out during the debate on the bill. Masked officers clashed with crowds shortly after it passed.  Zourabichvili told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour last week the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201c \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said.
