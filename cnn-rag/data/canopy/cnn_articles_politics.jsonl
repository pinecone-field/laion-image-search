{"id": "2024_04_28_politics_state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg", "text": "This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion \u2013 and a few aimed at restricting it. Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years. Abortion measures on the ballot in November Six states \u2014\u00a0Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state\u2019s 15-week ban on May 1. After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June. States with potential abortion ballot measures Organizers in other states across the country are working to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline this summer, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which are fundraising to secure the money to support the campaigns. Arizona and Montana have seen proposed measures protecting abortion access up to the point of viability, which doctors say is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. A potential measure in Arkansas would allow abortion up to 20 weeks into pregnancy or in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. A potential measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0could still make the ballot in November.\u00a0An opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion,\u00a0however,\u00a0never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session. A number of potential measures, like those in Arkansas and Montana, allow for abortion past the point of viability when deemed necessary by a doctor to protect a pregnant person\u2019s life or health \u2014 though doctors and lawmakers have struggled to define exactly what type of medical emergencies would be allowed under the exception. A proposed measure to restrict abortion access in Pennsylvania seeks to establish that public funding can\u2019t be used for the procedure, though it is unlikely to pass the state legislature. States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed. While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_us-ukraine-military-aid", "text": "The US announced a new $2.3 billion military aid package for Ukraine on Wednesday, one day after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US would soon provide Kyiv with more air defense interceptors and critical munitions. The new package includes $150 million in artillery rounds, interceptor missiles and anti-tank weapons, according to the Pentagon. This portion of the package is drawn directly from US stockpiles under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) and can be delivered quickly to Ukraine. An additional $2.2 billion will be purchased for Ukraine from US arms manufacturers under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), a program that takes longer to supply the weapons but provides longer-term support for Kyiv. The USAI portion includes Patriot and NASAMS air defense missiles, two of the systems that have been critical in defending against ongoing Russian\u00a0aerial barrages. \u201cThe Biden Administration plans to accelerate delivery of these munitions by re-sequencing upcoming Foreign Military Sales deliveries for Ukraine,\u201d the Pentagon said in announcing the new package. The $2.2 billion in USAI funding for Ukraine is one of the largest such packages the US has announced, though it is dwarfed by the $6 billion USAI package announced in late-April. This is also the fifth military aid package for Ukraine since the passage of a $95 billion supplemental aid package in April, which included $61 billion in aid for Ukraine. Since the passage of the supplemental, the US has kept up a steady rhythm of military aid to Ukraine, as the Biden administration has tried to help Kyiv slow a Russian offensive that began in May. In addition to military aid, the US has also loosened some restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of US weaponry, allowing Ukrainian forces to use American munitions to target Russian forces taking part in the offensive. CNN also reported last month that the Biden administration was moving towards lifting a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine to\u00a0help the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems. On Tuesday, Austin hosted Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Pentagon. In opening statements before their meeting, Austin said the US would soon be announcing the $2.3 billion security package. The US has provided approximately $53.6 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the war.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/us-ukraine-military-aid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

And he said of Biden: \u201cHe said it again last night, that global warming is an existential threat. And I say that the thing that\u2019s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise \u2013 maybe, it may go down, also \u2013 but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.\u201d He added what appeared to be a joke: \u201cWhich gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you\u2019re lucky\u00a0enough though.\u201d Facts\u00a0First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim about the expected pace of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0not even close to correct. The global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0is\u00a0currently risi\ufeffng\u00a0more\u00a0per year\u00a0than Trump claimed that people\u00a0say it will rise \u201cin the next 497 years.\u201d NASA\u00a0reported\u00a0in March that the current global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches\u00a0per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization\u00a0report this\u00a0year\u00a0said the rate of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise between 2014 and 2023 was\u00a0about 0.19 inches\u00a0per year. In other words,\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0already more than an eighth of an inch annually \u2013 and it is\u00a0accelerating. NASA\u00a0found\u00a0a jump of 0.3 inches\u00a0between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary\u00a0sciences\u00a0who\u00a0studies\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise,\u00a0said\u00a0last year that Trump\u2019s\u00a0similar claims\u00a0\u201ccan only be described as\u00a0totally out of touch with reality\u201d and that Trump \u201chas\u00a0no idea what he is\u00a0talking about.\u201d Sea levels\u00a0rise by different amounts\u00a0in\u00a0different locations. For the US,\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are\u00a0expected to rise particularly fast\u00a0for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast \u2013 and Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of Florida, which is\u00a0bordered by both of those coasts, is\u00a0expected to be\u00a0affected more\u00a0severely\u00a0than many other coastal\u00a0states. In fact, Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims\u00a0about\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is\u00a0on the Atlantic. Griggs\u00a0noted in a June email that\u00a0data\u00a0from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago\u00a0shows\u00a0an increase of an eighth of an inch\u00a0roughly\u00a0every\u00a0nine months. Trump has\u00a0made similar claims\u00a0since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also\u00a0previously\u00a0made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property.\u00a0In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland \u2013\u00a0rendering some communities uninhabitable\u00a0and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of\u00a0flooding, making hurricanes\u00a0more destructive, and damaging\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and ecosystems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_house-democrat-call-biden-withdraw", "text": "Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday became the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, a huge moment for the Democratic Party as Doggett says publicly what many elected officials had been speculating about privately. \u201cI represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson.\u00a0Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw,\u201d Doggett said in his statement. \u201cPresident Biden should do the same.\u201d Doggett\u2019s statement magnifies the pressure surrounding the president and his team, who have been trying to tamp down party concerns in the wake of Biden\u2019s disappointing debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week, and Doggett\u2019s comments could embolden others to follow suit. In calling on Biden to step aside, Doggett said the president could help usher in a new generation of leadership to help the party achieve its ultimate goal: defeating Trump. \u201cRecognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden\u2019s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cI respectfully call on him to do so.\u201d Asked by CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper later Tuesday whether it was tough to be the first\u00a0congressman\u00a0to call for the president to step out of the race, Doggett said, \u201cIn retrospect, I\u00a0wish I had said it earlier\u00a0because I think we needed \u2014 this\u00a0needed to be a decision that\u00a0was made much earlier in the\u00a0process.\u201d The 77-year-old said on \u201cAC360\u201d that \u201cbeing an older member of\u00a0Congress\u201d\u00a0and not a \u201cparticularly\u00a0vulnerable member of Congress\u201d gave him the ability to say what perhaps some other members\u00a0who share his view cannot.

Mike Quigley of Illinois had signaled an openness to replace Biden as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201cI think his four years are one of the great presidencies of our lifetime, but I think he has to be honest with himself,\u201d Quigley told Kasie Hunt on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cThis is a decision he\u2019s going to have to make.\u201d \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night, but I won\u2019t go beyond that out of my respect and understanding of President Joe Biden, a very proud person who has served us extraordinarily well for 50 years,\u201d he added. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Biden ally, said on MSNBC that the president should be participating in multiple interviews as people evaluate him. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for them to do that,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday. The former speaker,\u00a0who emphasized it is Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0about whether to step aside,\u00a0said that she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and other people in her Democratic network. \u201cI\u00a0think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0say,\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0an\u00a0episode\u00a0or\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0condition,\u201d Pelosi said,\u00a0though she added that the\u00a0same should be asked of Trump, citing his\u00a0repeated lies\u00a0during the debate. Meanwhile,\u00a0Democratic Rep. Jim\u00a0Clyburn of South Carolina, a crucial ally for Biden,\u00a0said on MSNBC he still supports Biden at the top of the ticket but\u00a0added that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to withdraw as the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cI will support her if he were to step aside,\u201d Clyburn\u00a0said when asked what he would do if Biden withdraws, later adding, \u201cThis party should not in any way do anything to work around Miss Harris.\u201d However, Clyburn\u00a0reaffirmed his support for Biden. \u201cI want this ticket to continue to be Biden-Harris and then we will see what happens after the next election,\u201d he said. Even more Democrats have been expressing their concerns behind the scenes. While the Biden campaign and White House have maintained that the president is staying in the race and have chalked up Biden\u2019s debate performance to a bad night that doesn\u2019t overshadow his accomplishments, lawmakers from across the party have been reaching out to share their anxieties about Biden remaining at the top of the ticket.

The announcement came after CNN reported that some governors expressed concerns about the president\u2019s debate performance. The governors, one source said, were worried about going public with their concerns out of fear it would lead to Biden digging in further. CNN talked to more than two dozen current and former Democratic officials, as well as donors and longtime Biden allies, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating Biden. Many of these people say they have already made up their minds that the president should quit his campaign, a decision some of them think he needs to announce this week. They have held off going to Biden directly, hoping he would make the decision himself, but patience is wearing thin, multiple Democrats told CNN, amid signs that Biden has taken no steps to seriously consider the mounting concerns.\u00a0He is poised to travel to swing states this weekend, aides said, a sign that he has no plans of changing course. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden will sit down with George Stephanopoulos for his first TV interview since the debate, with clips airing on Friday. Initially, there was hope that the president\u2019s family would convince him to step aside,\u00a0given how badly the debate went. However, at a Biden retreat Sunday at Camp David, it became apparent the president\u2019s family rallied around his decision to continue his campaign, blaming staff for his missteps. \u201cOne word you know about Biden: stubborn,\u201d said one senior Democratic official who has publicly supported Biden in the past but who privately thinks he needs to step aside. \u201cThey are trying to give him the space to realize what a disaster this is.\u201d And while the Biden campaign has insisted the debate was just a bad night for the 81-year-old president, the Democrats who want him to step aside say it was not a one-off incident that can be fixed. \u201cThis is not like Obama being rusty for a debate,\u201d said a senior Democratic official, referring to former President Barack Obama\u2019s lackluster performance in his first debate against Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201c[Biden] might be able to survive this if this was the only incident. But it won\u2019t be the only incident,\u201d said a senior Capitol Hill Democratic official. \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night,\u201d Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley told Kasie Hunt on\u00a0\u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cHe clearly has to understand, I think, what you\u2019re getting to here is that his decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come.\u201d During an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Biden to participate in multiple interviews with journalists in the aftermath of his debate performance. The California Democrat,\u00a0who emphasized it is Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0about whether to step aside,\u00a0said she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and others in her Democratic network. \u201cI\u00a0think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0say,\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0an\u00a0episode\u00a0or\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0condition?\u201d Pelosi said, referring to Biden\u2019s debate performance. She quickly added that this was a legitimate question for former President Donald Trump as well, citing his\u00a0repeated lies\u00a0during the debate. Stakes have never been higher The stakes, already remarkable, were raised even higher after the Supreme Court on Monday ruled Trump is entitled to considerable immunity from prosecution, a development that some concerned Democrats say makes it more urgent for Biden to step aside. The decision hands the former president a significant legal win and \u201cmakes Trump even more dangerous,\u201d said one former elected Democratic official who has supported Biden for years but who now wants him to end his campaign. One Biden adviser argued that the decision, and the fears of how Trump might now feel emboldened to act if reelected, only strengthens Biden\u2019s argument for staying in, as what that adviser said still feels like the surest bet of beating Trump. Some\u00a0leading Democrats, including at least one high-ranking Biden administration official,\u00a0have already started discussing what they believe would be a painful process to replace Biden and\u00a0pick a new ticket. In addition to Vice President Kamala Harris, a handful of governors and lawmakers are waiting on the Democratic bench. With\u00a0just\u00a0six weeks until the\u00a0Democratic National Convention\u00a0and under 130 days until the election, they want to get started. Facing\u00a0the highest-stakes moment of his long career, Biden is doubling down. The president who still thinks of himself as the stuttering kid so poor he had to wear nuts and bolts as cufflinks to a ninth-grade dance is still holding on to hope that this can be the latest time he comes back after being written off. \u201cHe bets on himself, and he always takes the long view, and he is not a reactionary like a lot of these folks are,\u201d said one person with years of experience in Biden\u2019s orbit. Earlier, Biden had not reached out to Democratic Party leaders himself to reassure them or to get feedback, something that many sources told CNN they found astounding given the fallout from the debate. He called House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries\u00a0Tuesday, a person familiar with the call told CNN, marking the first time they had spoken since the debate. CNN has reached out to Jeffries\u2019 office for comment. Biden also called Democratic Sen. Chris Coons on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. A longtime friend and co-chair of Biden\u2019s re-election campaign, Coons has been one of the president\u2019s staunchest public defenders since last week\u2019s debate. \u201cThey\u2019re equating this moment to every moment they\u2019ve overcome before, and not realizing it\u2019s a totally different moment,\u201d a Democratic operative close to the campaign said in reference to Biden and his inner circle. During a fundraiser in the Hamptons on Saturday, Biden used a teleprompter, something at least one donor mentioned as troubling. Meanwhile, first lady Jill Biden stuck to the Biden family mythology of resilience while introducing her husband. \u201cJoe\u2019s mom used to say that God never gives us a cross too heavy to carry,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t just the right person for the job; he\u2019s the only person for the job. \u2026 Joe\u2019s mom was right, there isn\u2019t a cross he can\u2019t bear, that he won\u2019t shoulder for our country and our democracy.\u201d Coons told CNN he would like to see the president counter the narrative of being too old and incompetent for the job by doing more public events, town halls and interviews. Ahead of the announcement of the ABC interview, White House advisers said Monday that Biden was considering a high-profile interview in the coming days to help prove his fitness for office, in hopes of showing his energetic North Carolina rally the day after debate was not simply a fluke. Campaign aides are also mapping out a more robust travel schedule to battleground states in July. Many leading Democrats doubt that Biden is up to that \u2014 and they see his secluded schedule since Sunday as evidence they are correct. That schedule is keeping to Biden\u2019s general mode. Using one metric: Biden has held 36 news conferences since taking office, compared with Trump\u2019s 64 by this point in his presidency, Barack Obama\u2019s 72 at this point in his, and George W. Bush\u2019s 82 by this point in his. Trump has also been out of public view since a post-debate rally in Virginia on Friday and has no schedule for the rest of the week. Anchors for a local television station announced that he at the last minute canceled an interview after the rally after aides asked for the questions in advance. He is expected to spend much of the next few days in New Jersey golfing. Even for some of those who are staying committed to Biden, a sense has settled in that there is little chance he would be able to make it through the four years that another term would entail.\u00a0The debate performance has so shaken Democrats that even stalwarts like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told local reporters back home in Rhode Island on Monday that he wants a fuller accounting of the president\u2019s health. From the West Wing to Wilmington While the high command of the Biden campaign on Monday tried to \u201ckeep reassuring everybody and absorbing people\u2019s worries,\u201d one adviser said, there has been a growing appreciation for the anger and concern many Democrats have expressed. \u201cThe seriousness of this is felt by people in the West Wing and in Wilmington,\u201d a different adviser added. Several Biden advisers told CNN the campaign is still working to assess the true fallout of the debate among voters in key battleground states, with an eye on whether Biden has fallen in a head-to-head matchup with Trump or whether the field of swing states has expanded.\u00a0A range of engaged senior Democrats cite Minnesota and Virginia as important gauges, as well as the Senate race in Michigan. House Democrats are deep into their own polling, assessing how much damage has been done. As dark as the mood is among some aides \u2014 including those who feel the wind knocked out of them after years of internalizing a related Biden mythology that he always delivers in a crunch \u2014 others are hoping to prove wrong people who never believed in him. Responding to The New York Times Editorial Board on Friday calling for Biden to drop out, one Biden aide reached out to CNN to offer this: \u201cThat sh*t is like jet fuel in my veins I love it.\u201d The New York Times did not endorse Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries. No clear fix The same small, insular inner circle that has guided Biden to this point is handling the fallout. Few familiar with how the members of that circle work believe it would be possible to force any of them out. Still, top aides at the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have spent the days since the debate on a constant churn of calls. Several people involved say that many of those calls have started badly but ended at least somewhat better. And the Biden campaign on Tuesday announced that June was its best fundraising month ever, with $127 million banked \u2014 with almost a third of that raised since the debate. Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon on Monday evening told members of the campaign\u2019s National Finance Committee that the team is \u201cclear-eyed, not pollyannish,\u201d two participants on the call told CNN.\u00a0She did not telegraph anything about Biden\u2019s plans other than full steam ahead. But after several previous calls with donors boiled over, the campaign restricted that Zoom call so that the only way to pose questions was to put them in a moderated chat. \u201cEvery time Joe Biden is counted out, he proves his doubters wrong. I have faith he\u2019ll do it this time too,\u201d said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime Biden supporter and donor. Phil Murphy, the New Jersey governor who called Biden the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d at a fundraiser he hosted with the president on Saturday night, said that at their dinner table they had a wide-ranging, coherent conversation that covered, by his telling, Ukraine, the Middle East, wage growth, job creation, dealing more effectively with corporations, and expanding prekindergarten and community college. \u201cHis life story, almost every step of the way \u2014 including through tragedy \u2014 is the story of a guy who\u2019s been counted out and succeeds against all expectations and all odds,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s in another one of those moments.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_cnn-poll-trump-biden-election-concede", "text": "Most Americans think that former President Donald Trump will not concede if he loses the presidential election in November, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And despite the vast majority of Americans agreeing that the loser of an election has an obligation to accept the results and concede, only about half of registered voters see Trump\u2019s false claims that he won the 2020 presidential election as a reason to vote against him in 2024. A 78% majority of Americans say they think that President Joe Biden will accept the results and concede if he loses the election this November. But roughly 7 in 10 Americans (71%) doubt that Trump will concede if he loses again in November, while only 28% believe he will. Half of Republicans now say they think Trump would concede a loss, up from 41% in a January poll taken amid the primary season. Among the public overall, doubts that Trump would concede are little changed from January, but remain heightened compared with October 2020, when a smaller 58% majority of US adults said they didn\u2019t expect him to concede if he lost the 2020 election. In CNN\u2019s June presidential debate, Trump refused to state unequivocally that he would accept this year\u2019s election results, twice deflecting the question before saying he would do so \u201cif it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election\u201d and repeating claims about election fraud. There is no evidence of election fraud that would have altered the outcome of the 2020 election. Most Americans (84%) say that the loser of the race has an obligation to concede once every state has officially certified its vote for president. That\u00a0number\u00a0has remained relatively unchanged since January and since Trump and Biden faced off in October 2020. Among registered voters who say they would support Biden in a head-to-head matchup against Trump, 95% believe the loser has an obligation to concede. This figure sits lower, at 77%, for those who would vote for Trump. Among current Biden supporters, there is almost universal agreement both that Biden would concede if he lost the election (97%) and that Trump would not (94%). Current Trump supporters also broadly agree about Biden, with 62% saying they think he will concede if he loses the election. On Trump, they\u2019re about evenly split, with 50% saying that Trump would concede and 49% saying he would not. Trump supporters who say candidates have an obligation to concede mostly think Trump and Biden\u00a0would do so (55% say that Trump would and 68% that Biden would), while those Trump backers who say no such obligation exists mostly see both presidential candidates as unlikely to concede. The poll also shows that, despite widespread belief that the loser of a presidential election should concede, only about half of registered voters think Trump\u2019s refusal to concede in 2020 is a reason to oppose his 2024 run. Forty-nine percent of registered voters say that Trump\u2019s claims that he won the 2020 election are a reason to vote against him in 2024, while 17% say they are a reason to vote for him. One-third of registered voters (33%) say his claims don\u2019t make a difference either way. More than half (55%) of current Trump supporters are indifferent toward his 2020 election claims, and about one-third (34%) say they are a reason to vote for him in 2024. Only 11% of current Trump supporters say his election claims are a reason to vote against him. By contrast, current Biden supporters reach a 92% consensus that Trump\u2019s claims are a reason to vote against him. Nearly half (46%) of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters \u2013 those who say they back him out of affirmative support, rather than opposition to Biden \u2013 say they consider Trump\u2019s claims about the 2020 election a positive. By contrast, just 10% of Trump supporters who say they\u2019d mostly support him as a vote against Biden see Trump\u2019s election claims as a reason to vote for him, with 28% calling them a negative, and 62% saying they don\u2019t make a difference either way. Beyond partisanship, the results also highlight a sharp educational divide, with college graduates 28 percentage points likelier than those without a degree to say Trump\u2019s 2020 election claims are a reason to vote against him this year. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from June 28-30 among a random national sample of 1,274 adults drawn from a probability-based panel, including 1,045 registered voters. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. For results among registered voters, it is plus or minus 3.7 points.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-election-concede/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_kamala-harris-joe-biden", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 camp is digging in and dismissing calls for her to replace President Joe Biden on the ticket amid escalating calls for the president to step aside and new polling showing the vice president outpacing Biden in a hypothetical race against Donald Trump. The mandate among Harris campaign staff is to remain firm, stay in line and keep the focus on the Biden-Harris ticket, one source told CNN.\u00a0The vice president\u2019s staff received similar guidance in a virtual staff meeting Monday to follow the vice president\u2019s lead and keep heads down, another source told CNN. The internal marching orders echo the message Harris is taking on the trail. On Tuesday, Harris again\u00a0batted down the idea of running in Biden\u2019s place during a brief interview with CBS. \u201cLook, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d she said. \u201cI am proud to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate,\u201d she later added. The\u00a0latest CNN poll\u00a0conducted following last week\u2019s debate\u00a0shows\u00a0Harris\u00a0within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47% of registered voters support Trump and 45%\u00a0Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario. Former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan publicly called on Democrats to replace Biden with Harris. \u201cWe talk about President Biden\u2019s administration being the most successful administration in modern history. We brag about that. She was in the room. She was right there, three-and-a-half years, went through the campaign with him,\u201d Ryan told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Tuesday. \u201cI think she would be able to talk about that much clearer than the president would be able to,\u201d Ryan added, referring to the administration\u2019s record. \u201cI think she would absolutely juice up the Democratic base.\u201d Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, meanwhile, didn\u2019t call on Biden to drop out of the race and stopped short of fully backing her fellow Californian, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d that there should be \u201ca robust democratic process\u201d to determine the Democratic nominee should the president step back. The congresswoman said Harris \u201cwould be a very, very top contender in that process,\u201d but she signaled openness to other candidates, arguing the more \u201cqualified\u201d candidates there are in the race at that point, \u201cthe better for our democracy.\u201d The White House, Porter said, \u201cfumbled\u201d the strategy for damage control following the debate and she urged the president to \u201cget\u00a0out\u00a0there\u00a0and\u00a0earn\u00a0the\u00a0trust\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0American\u00a0people\u201d and not just contact top Democrats in Congress as Biden has done in recent days. In the immediate fallout from the debate,\u00a0Harris\u2019\u00a0staff\u00a0made phone\u00a0calls\u00a0to check in with Democratic officials, trying to reassure them, remind them of Biden\u2019s record and agenda and call on them to remain united, CNN previously reported. Sources close to the vice president have repeatedly maintained that she is fiercely loyal to Biden, arguing that her public statements since last week\u2019s CNN-hosted presidential debate reflect where she is. \u201cSome just don\u2019t understand the rules, some are stirring the pot and some have their own agenda,\u201d one source close to Harris said, when asked about calls for Harris to replace Biden on the ticket.\u00a0\u201cBut for her, there is one plan and focus and it starts with Joe Biden and this country.\u201d Biden and Harris have spoken multiple times since Thursday\u2019s debate, two sources familiar with the conversations said. And on Wednesday, the president is keeping his running mate intentionally close. The two had lunch in Biden\u2019s private dining room at the White House and made a joint appearance during a call with campaign staff in Wilmington. Harris has also been invited by the president and his advisers to join the meeting with governors, placing her in the same room as some of the very men and women who could become challengers \u2013 or, potential running mates of her own, should Biden end his bid for reelection and she becomes the Democratic nominee. The overarching message, a senior campaign adviser told CNN: \u201cHe\u2019s with her.\u201d Should Biden step aside, several party officials and advisers say plans are underway for Biden to immediately throw his support behind Harris, release his Democratic delegates and ask them to do the same. Former presidents and party leaders would follow suit, in hopes of avoiding a contentious fight to lead the Democratic ticket. \u201cWho would stand up against our historic vice president to be our nominee for president?\u201d a senior Democratic official told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks in advance of any formal decision from Biden. But Harris is going to great lengths to avoid being seen as getting ahead of the president. She told her team again Wednesday the timing of this decision \u201cis Biden\u2019s alone to make,\u201d one aide said. \u201cThe President is and will remain our party\u2019s nominee, and Vice President Harris is proud to be his running mate, and looks forward to serving at his side for four more years,\u201d Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, told CNN. \u201cReports suggesting they or the campaign are considering alternative scenarios are patently false.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_democrats-house-biden", "text": "In the days since President Joe Biden\u2019s disappointing debate performance, a number of Democrats running in competitive districts have expressed their fear to the Biden campaign and the White House that the president remaining at the top of the ticket not only hurts the party\u2019s chances of holding onto the presidency but also the coveted goal of winning back the House of Representatives from GOP control. The Democratic lawmakers have expressed their belief that Biden could suppress voter turnout, which will be the deciding factor in a number of key races, and therefore hurt their ability to win in November, according to multiple sources familiar with the conversations. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents\u00a0a largely rural district in Maine that twice backed former President Donald Trump, said Tuesday in an op-ed he expects Trump to win in November \u201cand I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d Washington state Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez said Tuesday she believes Biden will lose but stopped short of calling for him to drop out of the race. \u201cAbout 50 million Americans tuned in and watched that debate. I was one of them for about five very painful minutes. We all saw what we saw, you can\u2019t undo that, and the truth, I think, is that Biden is going to lose to Trump. I know that\u2019s difficult, but I think the damage has been done by that debate,\u201d Gluesenkamp Perez told CNN affiliate KATU when asked if Biden should remain in the race. In particular, Democrats in the most difficult general election matchups are feeling the heat. \u201cThe frontliners are not hesitating to tell the campaign how they feel,\u201d one Democratic lawmaker familiar with the conversations told CNN. \u201cThey are saying they are going to lose if they have to run with Joe Biden.\u201d Retiring Rep. Ann Kuster, who represents a hotly contested swing seat in New Hampshire, told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt she\u2019s been in touch with both the White House and Biden campaign \u201cabout concerns about the president\u2019s well-being are impacting house races, particularly challenging districts.\u201d \u201cIn order to respond to our constituents\u2019 concerns, we need to demonstrate that the president is fit not just for the job, but for the campaign,\u201d Kuster said. \u201cJoe Biden has always done the right thing for his country, so that\u2019s why I expect that this will get resolved. And that\u00a0Democrats will be united behind the ticket.\u201d Another House Democrat from a deep blue state told CNN on Wednesday the last 24 hours have started to feel different. The lawmaker\u00a0described the flood of messages from delegates and rank-and-file Democratic voters in the last 24 hours as all saying essentially the same thing: \u201cI love and respect the president, but it\u2019s time.\u201d This Democratic lawmaker said this was the first time since Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance that delegates and rank-and-file Democratic voters expressed their desire for Biden to step aside. And another Democratic lawmaker said that their assessment of Biden\u2019s candidacy is that \u201cit\u2019s over, we are just waiting for the announcement. [Biden] is not there yet, will take a bit to get there, but it\u2019s over.\u201d Asked if Biden\u2019s interviews and events scheduled over the next few days could change that, the lawmaker did not think so. \u201cIt\u2019s about the data,\u201d this member said, noting that it is \u201cgetting worse.\u201d The lawmaker also said a full member call is being scheduled among Democrats on the Hill. As of Wednesday afternoon, the timing of the call had not been set. The White House tried to quell concerns Tuesday, with spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre opening her briefing saying:\u00a0\u201cFirst of all, I want to say, we understand the concerns. We get it. The president did not have a great night.\u201d She later added: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking away from what the American people saw.\u201d Asked whether Biden regularly presents himself the way he did at the debate, Jean-Pierre cited a speech that Biden\u00a0gave in North Carolina the day after the debate:\u00a0\u201cHe understands that he\u2019s not a young man,\u201d she said, adding that his focus is going to be on continuing \u201cto deliver for the American people on the issues that they care about.\u201d Asked about the Democratic concerns, Biden campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said: \u201cThe President has spoken personally with multiple elected officials on the Hill and across the battlegrounds since the debate.\u201d Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington state Democrat who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, remained emphatic in her support for Biden in a statement. \u201cThe stakes are incredibly high this election, for all of us. That hasn\u2019t changed after last week,\u201d DelBene said. \u201cThe choice this November is crystal clear: Democrats who want to govern responsibly versus extremist Republicans obsessed with tax breaks for billionaires, rolling back reproductive freedom, and defending Trump\u2019s attacks on our democracy. Our candidates are authentic leaders with proven records and I remain confident Democrats will retake the majority.\u201d Battle for control Democrats have an uphill battle to retain control of the Senate.\u00a0Republicans needs to pick up only one or two seats \u2014 depending on which party wins the White House \u2014 to flip control, and the races will come down to whether red-state Democrats can defy the partisan tilt of their states. But the House is a different story. Republicans control the\u00a0House\u00a0by a narrow margin and 17\u00a0of\u00a0those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed Biden in 2020. The dysfunction that has overshadowed the current Republican majority has emphasized the pitfalls of razor-thin margins but underscores how even the lower chamber can serve as a roadblock to the White House. Another Democrat in contact with the Biden campaign said, \u201cI know that I and others are stressing the importance of flipping the House as a last firewall in the case of a Trump presidency.\u201d But the response Democrats are getting back is largely to hold tight until the president and his inner circle can assess the damage done and chart a path forward. \u201cThe Biden campaign has heard a lot of concern from strong supporters across the country but has asked for time to process and digest incoming polling data and to map out a strategy going forward\u201d one Democratic lawmaker told CNN. \u201cEveryone is standing by the president as his campaign works to assess the damage done,\u201d the lawmaker added. The prevailing line from the campaign continues to be that Biden had a bad debate night that should not diminish the record he has built up in his first term, particularly compared to the danger that Trump poses. Some Democrats, however, are not willing to wait. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday\u00a0became\u00a0the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race,\u00a0\u00a0while a\u00a0growing number\u00a0of Democratic leaders are saying they want him to step aside for the good of the party \u2014 and the country. Getting out there The other prevailing sentiment lawmakers have been sharing with the campaign in recent days is their desire for the president to hold more events and media interviews if he is serious about putting his debate performance in the rearview mirror. Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on House Foreign Affairs, acknowledged the day after the debate that it was a difficult night for Biden and said that the president should take steps to prove that he is capable of a second term by holding more town hall meetings and answering hard questions from the press. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to have to put himself out there more,\u201d Meeks told reporters. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, agreed. \u201cObviously, he needs to take his message to the public. I think his strategy should be continue to engage,\u201d Thompson said Friday. The White House said Tuesday Biden will participate in a campaign event Friday as well as an interview with ABC News. They also announced a news conference next week as part of the DC-hosted NATO summit. But the concern among the handful of Democrats, whom CNN granted anonymity to speak candidly, was whether more Biden appearances would help stop the drumbeat of anxiety about the president\u2019s ability to remain at the top of the ticket. \u201cIt will help if it proves he can be relaxed, freewheeling and fluent, but it will hurt if he\u2019s entirely scripted on the teleprompter and seemingly exhausted. It all depends on what the public sees,\u201d another Democratic lawmaker told CNN. Publicly standing by Biden Publicly, House Democratic leaders have stood behind Biden but have also pivoted the conversation to what they can control: winning back the House. House Democratic Leader Hakeem\u00a0Jeffries\u00a0told reporters \u201cwe are going to win the House in November\u201d when asked about his reaction to Biden\u2019s performance the day after the debate. Biden called Jeffries\u00a0as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday, sources told CNN, the first time that Biden spoke with the Democratic leaders since the debate. House Democratic leadership are holding a call Wednesday, a source familiar told CNN. The day after the debate, Jeffries and former President Barack Obama held a fundraiser for the House Democratic campaign arm in New York, specifically focused on the need for Democrats to take back the House, and raised $3 million, according to a source familiar. In\u00a0a further\u00a0effort to tamp down concerns, Biden campaign also sent an email to the\u00a0chiefs of staff\u00a0for House Democratic members on Wednesday laying out the latest polling numbers and touting their recent $127 million fundraising\u00a0haul, a source\u00a0familiar shared with CNN.\u00a0The campaign said their polling reflected a steady race, noting that polls \u201care a snapshot in time\u201d and could fluctuate. The No. 3 Democrat in the House, Rep. Pete Aguilar, told CNN that Biden had a \u201ctough night\u201d at the debate but added \u201cit\u2019s all the more reason why I\u2019m going to work every day between now and November to flip the House.\u201d Meanwhile, old guard Democratic lawmakers Reps. Jim Clyburn and Nancy Pelosi also weighed in Tuesday, with Clyburn backing Biden but offering that, if he weren\u2019t at the top of the ticket, he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Pelosi, the former House speaker, said it was a \u201clegitimate question\u201d for voters to ask whether Biden\u2019s debate performance last week was \u201cepisode\u201d or if it is \u201ca condition\u201d during an interview on MSNBC Tuesday. The former speaker also said that she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and other people in her Democratic network. \u201cSome are like, well, how can we subject the [nomination] process to what might be possible? And others are, \u2018Joe\u2019s our guy. We love him, we trust him.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt is going to be up to Joe Biden,\u201d she added. This story has been updated with additional developments.

Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona has become the second sitting Democrat in Congress to call on President Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, according to\u00a0an interview with The New York Times. \u201cIf he\u2019s the candidate, I\u2019m going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,\u201d Grijalva told the Times. \u201cWhat he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat \u2014 and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.\u201d Grijalva joins Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas as just one of two elected Democrats on Capitol Hill to call for Biden to step down from the ticket. The comments from the two Democratic lawmakers mark a stunning public break with the president from members of his own party and ramp up the pressure on Biden at a pivotal moment for his campaign in the wake of his weak performance at CNN\u2019s presidential debate. CNN has reached out to Grijalva\u2019s office for comment. CNN reported earlier on Wednesday that Biden has privately acknowledged that the next stretch of days are critical to whether he can save\u00a0his reelection bid for president. In the days since\u00a0the debate, a number of Democrats running in competitive districts have expressed their fear to the Biden campaign and the White House that the president remaining at the top of the ticket not only hurts the party\u2019s chances of holding onto the presidency but also the coveted goal of\u00a0winning back\u00a0the House of Representatives from GOP control. President Joe Biden is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d considering stepping down, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. \u201cHe understands that it is fair for people to ask that question,\u201d \u201cJean-Pierre said, adding that she saw the president walking around the West Wing before she came out to the lectern for the press briefing, and that \u201che looks great.\u201d Grijalva represents a solidly-Democratic district in southern Arizona along the US-Mexico border.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_presidential-debate-trump-biden", "text": "The confrontation in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump Thursday night has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in US history. For the first time, a sitting president and an ex-president will lock horns before millions of viewers, in an encounter taking place far earlier than normal \u2014 even before the party conventions. The CNN-hosted showdown is the most pivotal moment yet in a neck-and-neck election, and it\u2019s Biden\u2019s best chance to shake up a reelection bid that he is in deep danger of losing as he struggles to convince voters that he\u2019s delivered the political and economic normality he promised in 2020. The debate comes at a moment when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices that have made it harder to feed their families and afford rents, mortgages, and new cars. It is unfolding amid an intense national debate over access to abortion that was unleashed by the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump. Deep divides over immigration and foreign policy in a world filled with new challenges to US power will form a contentious backdrop to a clash between two candidates who openly disdain one another. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract. But the momentous circumstances of the occasion can only be fully understood alongside the context of the unprecedented politics of the times. Since Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon staged\u00a0the first televised debate\u00a0in the 1960 campaign, there have been agonizingly close elections that have set the country on a sharply different course. But the stakes in 2024 are greater than ever because of Trump\u2019s attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power based on false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and his promise to wage a never-before-seen presidency of personal vengeance if he wins in November. Biden plans to frame what he sees as Trump\u2019s threat to the rule of law and democracy in the starkest terms, sources familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. He will describe the mob attack by Trump\u2019s supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201cseismic,\u201d era-defining moment that must be a watershed for voters. \u201cThe embodiment of the threat is returning,\u201d said one Biden source. That backdrop means this presidential debate has a different cast than all its predecessors. Had Sen. John Kerry beaten President George W. Bush in 2004 or ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney made President Barack Obama a one-term president in 2012, there would have been significant political change. But the character of the republic and its global posture would not have fundamentally altered. That assurance cannot be applied with any confidence to the current election. Trump\u2019s strongman impulse \u2013 epitomized by his claim before the Supreme Court that presidents have almost limitless power, as well as a blueprint for hardline new policies on immigration, the economy and foreign policy \u2013 means a second term could bring massive disruption. \u201c(It is) unbelievably historic. You cannot (over) hype up the importance of this,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Democrats are desperate for the 81-year-old Biden to put on a show of vitality and sharpness amid concerns about his age. Seventy-eight-year-old Trump\u2019s biggest liability might be himself and the possibility of a performance that could validate Biden\u2019s warnings that he\u2019s too \u201cunhinged\u201d to be president. Biden is expected to hammer Trump over abortion \u2014 one of the few policy areas where he outpolls the former president \u2014 and his admiration of foreign dictators. Trump is already signaling he\u2019ll portray Biden\u2019s America in dystopian terms, beset by uncontrolled immigration, rampant crime and searing economic pain. The most extraordinary aspect of the debate is that it takes place less than a month after Trump was convicted in a criminal hush money case in New York. Biden has already highlighted the guilty verdict in campaign events, but Trump insists that he\u2019s the victim of an attempt to weaponize the legal system to interfere in the election. Both candidates are facing extreme pressure Both men will hope to avoid the kind of debate night gaffes or odd personal quirks that have often gone viral and dominated critical post-debate media coverage that helps cement the perception of who won and who lost in voters\u2019 minds. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s theatrical sighs in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch in 1992 both became emblems of losing campaigns. The risks are now much higher because of social media. Presidential debates don\u2019t always decide who wins in November. But the tension surrounding this year\u2019s first debate in June, rather than in September or October as usual, is palpable. \u201cThe closer the election, the greater the chance that a debate could influence it,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who has conducted an in-depth study of every presidential debate. \u201cA lot of times these mistakes reaffirm a caricature of one of the particular candidates that existed before it happened.\u201d For Biden, that means no senior moments, and Trump would be advised to avoid outbursts that confirm Biden\u2019s characterization of a tyrant in waiting. Neither Trump nor Biden has debated since their final clash in the pandemic-disrupted 2020 campaign. And their preparation for one of the most important nights of their lives has reflected their character and political personas. The president has been out of sight for days, huddled below the oaks, poplars and maple trees at the Camp David retreat with advisers, strategizing how to handle the most challenging debate foe in history. Fueled by lasagna and tacos, he\u2019s taken part in mock debates, immersed himself in briefing binders and tried to anticipate Trump\u2019s wild twists and diversions. It\u2019s a debate camp in keeping with Biden\u2019s view that he\u2019s locked in an existential election duel with the soul of the nation on the line. The former president hates mock debates and has instead honed his preparation at rallies and events, trusting his instincts and intuition and a feral sense of an opponent\u2019s political weakness. He has, however, had policy refresher sessions with aides and some potential vice-presidential picks including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Biden has raised the stakes for himself heading into the debate higher than those any modern president faced. He argues Trump is a criminal in whom something has \u201csnapped\u201d and who is too dangerous and reckless to be let back into the White House. He\u2019s also rebuked Trump for using Nazi-style language and warned democracy and freedom are on the ballot along with the capacity of \u2018We the People\u2019 to shape America\u2019s destiny. Preparing for anything at Camp David Biden\u2019s debate team is led by former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation. One of Klain\u2019s mantras is \u201cwhile you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d Biden is therefore expected to front-load the most important points to appeal to the likely highest rated part of the primetime event. The Biden team has been poring over Trump\u2019s recent public interviews and speeches while workshopping responses to whatever he and the moderators may throw Biden\u2019s way. The president will be ready for whichever version of Trump shows up \u2013 whether it\u2019s the bombastic opponent who talked over and insulted him in their first clash in 2020, or a more restrained challenger seeking to project stability. If Trump aims for a presidential bearing, Biden has a locker full of practiced attacks and rebuttals designed to provoke him into making the outbursts that could turn voters off. A Biden adviser told CNN that debate preparations have included getting the president ready to respond should Trump get personal\u00a0 \u2014 weeks after his son Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges. Biden\u2019s love and protective instinct for his family is always close to the surface, and he reacted furiously when the then-president brought up Hunter during their first debate in 2020. Biden has been running through his paces inside a large hangar at the Maryland retreat, where there\u2019s a mock debate stage complete with bright television lights. His personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is playing Trump and other aides have sat in as CNN moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But sources told CNN that the debate practice was about more than feeling comfortable. It\u2019s also about answering the age question. Aides and allies of the president alike have frequently pointed to his State of the Union address in March as a model example of Biden at his best. He was energetic, focused and nimble, they\u2019ve argued, over the course of his 67-minute prime-time speech. Trump\u2019s debate prep is as unorthodox as he is Sitting presidents often have a rude awakening at first presidential debates, since they are unused to anyone getting in their grill and contradicting them. But Trump\u2019s advantage on this score may be compromised since he refused to debate any of his GOP primary rivals this year. Still, his aggressive debate style isn\u2019t much different from the belligerent, spiky attitude he displays in most public events. Trump has warmed up for the debate by suggesting that Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs, as his aides frantically have tried to dismantle the expectations trap that the ex-president constructed for himself by suggesting that Biden is so mentally diminished that he can barely stand up or finish a sentence. In any other era, the idea of a candidate accusing an opponent of doping would be unthinkable. But Trump\u2019s tactic is a reminder of a presidency and a political style that has shattered all previous norms. In a new memo on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign signaled that the ex-president would assail Biden over immigration and the economy. It boasted about polling averages that his team says show the former president up in all the key states. And Trump, whose administration created a gale of daily falsehoods, characteristically worked to accuse Biden of the very transgression that is most associated with him \u2014 lying. \u201cThe man is a walking lying machine and a fact-checker\u2019s dream,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, while accusing Biden, one of the best presidential golfers, of being unable to hit a ball 10 yards. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach means that the country may get another reminder of the chaos, discord and cacophony that it experienced in his four years in office \u2014 and that his supporters love and want to restore. But it\u2019s also a risk that could play into Biden\u2019s desire to get voters to see the contrast between the 45th and 46th presidents that he believes could deliver him the election. Former Obama speechwriter Terry Szuplat said successful debate performances tell a coherent story of where the country is and where it is going. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about yourself. Why you\u2019re the right candidate. Why the other candidate is the wrong candidate.\u00a0And it\u2019s a story about the future. Every election is about the future. It\u2019s a choice about the future,\u201d Szuplat told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. Neither Trump nor Biden has so far fulfilled that goal. Thursday is the best chance to do so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/presidential-debate-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_transgender-anti-discrimination-protections-biden-chevron", "text": "The Biden administration cannot enforce new anti-discrimination rules in health care for transgender Americans, a federal judge in Mississippi ruled Wednesday, citing a recent landmark Supreme Court ruling that weakened the power of federal agencies. The preliminary injunction from US District Judge Louis Guirola comes just two days before the new protections were set to take effect. The George W. Bush appointee said his block on the federal protections will apply nationwide. The new rules unveiled by the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year were meant to bar health providers and insurers receiving federal funding from discriminating against those seeking care on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. The HHS rule restored Obama-era protections\u00a0for transgender patients that\u00a0the Trump administration rolled back in 2020. But the rules were swiftly met with legal challenges, including from a group of Republican state attorneys general who argued that HHS overstepped its authority when it issued the new rules and that they would be harmed by a loss of federal funding for not complying with the changes. Guirola agreed, ruling that HHS had wrongly leaned on a\u00a02020 Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that said federal civil rights law that bars sex discrimination protects LGBTQ workers when it issued the new rules. The Biden administration has in recent years used the court\u2019s ruling in the case, Bostock v. Clayton County, to create protections for LGBTQ+ Americans. In ruling against the Biden administration, the judge also pointed to a major Supreme Court ruling last week that overturned the decades-old \u201cChevron Deference\u201d precedent that required courts to give deference to federal agencies that create regulations based on an ambiguous law. \u201cPlaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that HHS exceeded its statutory authority by applying the Bostock holding to Section 1557\u2019s incorporation of Title IX in its May 2024 Rule,\u201d Guirola wrote, going on to quote from the high court\u2019s ruling last week. \u201c\u2019And to the extent that Congress and the Executive Branch may disagree with how the courts have performed [their] job in a particular case, they are of course always free to act by revising the statute.\u2019\u201d \u201cHHS acted unreasonably when it relied on Bostock\u2019s analysis in order to conflate the phrase \u2018on the basis of sex\u2019 with the phrase \u2018on the basis of gender identity,\u2019\u201d Guirola wrote. \u201cSpecifically, the Bostock holding did not \u2018sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination.\u2019\u201d The blocked rules stem from\u00a0Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bars \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in specified health programs or activities.\u201d\u00a0The new HHS guidelines stipulate that while Section 1557\u2019s prohibition on sex discrimination includes LGBTQ+ patients \u2014 and bans limiting access to care based on a patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth or gender identity \u2014 exemptions based on health care providers\u2019 religious beliefs still apply. CNN has reached out to HHS for comment on the ruling. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican who is part of the lawsuit challenging the new protections, applauded Wednesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe administration has over and over again issued regulations that mangle the law to advance an ideological agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case is just one of many examples of\u00a0Tennessee\u00a0working with other states to block the unlawful abuse of regulatory power.\u201d CNN\u2019s Avery Lotz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/transgender-anti-discrimination-protections-biden-chevron/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_never-trump-republicans-biden-post-debate", "text": "A couple of weeks ago, there was conversation and conviviality among a bunch of strangers brought together at a bar in Denver by their shared antipathy towards former President Donald Trump. Many were Republicans or former Republicans who were finally in a place where they could talk openly about their political views and how they wanted to stop Trump from returning to the White House in what\u2019s set to be\u00a0a tight election this fall. Becky Hofer said it was \u201ctough to find a community\u201d in her \u201cvery red\u201d home state of South Dakota. She used to consider herself a Republican but said the party had transformed over the last decade. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to wake up every morning and talk to my neighbors and know that they\u2019re supporting somebody that just doesn\u2019t match any of their values,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re throwing away all of their values to support a person, for what? Tax breaks that we\u2019re really not going to get?\u201d Hofer and hundreds of others at the event hosted by The Bulwark, a media organization created by former Republican operatives and conservative writers who oppose Trump, talked of their political journeys and how many had come to terms with crossing party lines and supporting President Joe Biden. Paul Ivancie of Denver told CNN: \u201cMy politics is former Republican. Unaffiliated now, but leaning heavily towards, I think, voting for the only alternative, which is Biden or the Democratic side.\u201d But then came the debate. Biden\u2019s\u00a0dismal performance\u00a0and\u00a0Trump\u2019s continued false claims\u00a0in the CNN event raised new concerns for these voters, who already consider themselves \u201cpolitically homeless.\u201d \u201cI am very concerned about Joe Biden,\u201d Hofer said. She had a visceral reaction to his appearance, because it reminded her of the early years of her mom\u2019s diagnosis with dementia. She\u2019d gone through her mom\u2019s belongings and found little slips with important phone numbers and addresses tucked into her wallet, and napkin drawer and clothes, because her mom had been hiding that she was losing her memory. \u201cJoe Biden needs to be replaced because, in my opinion, it is nothing short of elder abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the fact that we as an entire country are sitting here watching people wheel our elderly politicians around like it\u2019s \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 is disgusting. \u2026 He needs to be replaced if for anything just out of respect for his humanity.\u201d Robin Hawkland had enjoyed being with fellow Bulwark listeners. \u201cYou feel safe here and you feel like you can speak your mind,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd people may disagree, but you can talk about it in a rational way.\u201d Any positive political feelings were wiped away by the debate, which she said shocked both her and her husband. \u201cThe next day, we started feeling kind of angry watching the news \u2013 like, have they been hiding something from us about Biden?\u201d She continued: \u201cEverybody sees it. Everybody I\u2019ve talked to. Everybody\u2019s concerned about it. More so the people who don\u2019t want Trump elected.\u201d Hawkland, a health care worker, said she had already \u201cfled\u201d her home in Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s district in north Georgia after the congresswoman was \u201cpretty abusive to people wearing masks during Covid.\u201d She and her husband, who voted for Trump in 2016, now live in a \u201cblue bubble\u201d neighborhood of Salt Lake City in the red state of Utah. She said they both registered as Democrats when they got their new Utah drivers licenses. But once again, their worlds have been turned upside down. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these people who were Republicans, they\u2019re asking: \u2018What? Why? I\u2019m just in the same bad situation in this party.\u2019\u201d Still, these voters had no warmer feelings for Trump after the debate, and perhaps more alarm about a possible second term after the Supreme Court ruled that a former president has\u00a0\u201csome immunity from criminal prosecution\u201d\u00a0for official acts. \u201cDonald Trump did not answer a single question. The Supreme Court ruling \u2026 has me sick to my stomach,\u201d Hofer said, back home in South Dakota. \u201cI think it is critical Donald Trump does not win.\u201d That was echoed by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush and expert in opposition research, who is now the host of \u201cThe Bulwark Podcast.\u201d After taping an episode in front of the audience, he told CNN he believed the Biden campaign should court voters who feel they no longer have a home in the Republican Party: \u201cThey\u2019re gonna need our people.\u201d That mission got harder after Biden\u2019s debate performance, he said. \u201c\u201dHe should step down unless he can dramatically upgrade his performance and demonstrate he is up for the job.\u201d Sarah Longwell, a former Republican strategist and publisher of The Bulwark, added: \u201cThe stakes are too high not to consider all options available.\u201d The Never Trumpers and Never Again Trumpers who met in Denver still have the same goal \u2013 anyone but Trump in the White House. But they\u2019re now waiting to see if they will be faced with voting for Biden or someone else. \u201cStopping Trump is the number one issue \u2013 with or without Biden,\u201d Ivancie said. \u201cThere are certainly capable people in his stead, should he not decide to run, that I think could be a powerful contrast to Trump.\u201d Hawkland said the debate followed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on presidential immunity was like \u201call the dominoes are falling one after the other.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to feel hopeless,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re in some kind of strange vortex that we cannot get out of.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/never-trump-republicans-biden-post-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_trump-sentencing-date-delay-proposal", "text": "Donald Trump will not be sentenced on his business fraud conviction until September, a New York judge ruled Tuesday in the wake of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity. The delay in sentencing means that the former president is likely to escape any concrete punishment for his felony conviction during the summer, at the same time that Trump\u2019s election bid has been boosted by President Joe Biden\u2019s debate flop that has Democrats wondering whether to replace their nominee. Trump was scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. Judge Juan Merchan said the former president will now be sentenced on September 18, \u201cif such is still necessary.\u201d The announcement underscores the far-reaching implications of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, in which the court\u2019s conservative wing found that presidents have absolute immunity for \u201ccore\u201d presidential duties. The decision has thrown special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment of Trump on election subversion charges into doubt \u2013 and a trial before the November election is all but impossible now. The ruling could impact the indictments of Trump in the classified documents and Georgia election interference cases as well. Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony in May when a Manhattan jury found him guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in his\u00a0hush money criminal trial. Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction after the Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that presidents have an absolute immunity\u00a0from prosecution for core official acts. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office on Tuesday agreed the sentencing should be delayed. \u201cAlthough we believe defendant\u2019s arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion. We respectfully request a deadline of July 24, 2024\u2014two weeks after defendant\u2019s requested deadline\u2014to file and serve a response,\u201d the DA said in a letter Tuesday. The former president\u2019s lawyers argued that the ruling confirmed their position that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should not have been allowed to offer evidence at the trial regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial acts\u201d and, as a result, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be set aside. Will Scharf, an attorney who represents Trump in the immunity case, told CNN Monday night the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cabsolutely\u201d impacts the hush money case. \u201cThe Supreme Court was very clear that for acts that fall within the outer perimeter of the president\u2019s official responsibilities, acts that are presumptively immune from prosecution, that evidence of those acts cannot be used to try essentially private acts,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d In their letter Monday, Trump\u2019s attorneys pointed to evidence elicited during the trial from Trump\u2019s time in office, including testimony from former Hope Hicks, who served as communications director in the White House; tweets that Trump sent while in office; and phone records involving Trump while he was president. \u201cUnder Trump, this official-acts evidence should never have been put before the jury. Consistent with arguments that we made before and during the trial, the Supreme Court held in Trump that President Trump \u2018may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cThe verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of \u2018an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,\u2019\u201d they added.

The Washington Post\u2019s reporting comes a day after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took at the end of his presidency.

{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_lbj-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, according to CNN\u2019s latest report. He remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision. Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here\u2019s part of that address: It is a remarkable speech to watch today. Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded. By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson\u2019s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted. Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16. Health was a concern for LBJ Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term. \u201cThere\u2019s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,\u201d Updegrove said. \u201cHe had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn\u2019t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,\u201d Updegrove added. A year of incredible uncertainty 1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson\u2019s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty. Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities. In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent. If Biden decides to step aside this year, Democrats should study what happened in 1968, when they ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside. In November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states. Johnson remains one of the country\u2019s most transformative presidents Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a \u201cgreat society,\u201d including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty. Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/lbj-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_burgum-carbon-dioxide-pipeline-invs", "text": "As Donald Trump is considering him for his vice-presidential pick, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum could play a deciding role in allowing a massive carbon dioxide pipeline project \u2013 backed by GOP megadonors who have given to Burgum and Trump\u2019s campaigns\u00a0\u2013 to seize property rights from rural landowners in his state. Burgum\u2019s vocal backing of the project so far is a sign of his transformation over the last decade, from a gubernatorial candidate who originally criticized the political influence of the energy industry, to one who\u2019s used his close ties with oil executives, including a major investor in the pipeline project, to boost his vice-presidential prospects. Critics say the project could have a detrimental environmental impact in North Dakota, and a group of landowners have strongly resisted the company\u2019s plans to build a pipeline across or store carbon dioxide under their property. That\u2019s put political pressure on Burgum, who\u2019s part of a three-member state committee set to vote this fall on a permit that would pave\u00a0the way for the project to use a form of eminent domain power. \u201cFor a lot of people, land can be just an investment, but if you\u2019re a farmer or a rancher and it\u2019s your land, it is in your lifeblood,\u201d Troy Coons,\u00a0a farmer who leads an advocacy group for North Dakota landowners, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been very disheartening to see how our governor has not held true to what the promises were for the farming and ranching community\u201d about protecting property rights. As governor, Burgum has tried to play both sides of climate policy. In 2021, he set an ambitious goal for North Dakota to be carbon neutral by 2030, and he signed a bill in 2017 to create North Dakota\u2019s first Department of Environmental Quality. But as he\u2019s stepped onto the national stage and ingratiated himself to Trump after dropping out of the Republican presidential primary, critics say Burgum has shifted to emphasize his support of oil. He has harshly criticized Biden administration climate regulations,\u00a0and joined Trump for a fundraiser with oil executives at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump has praised him on the topic, saying at a rally\u00a0that Burgum \u201cprobably knows more about energy than anybody I know.\u201d A former tech executive who hails from North Dakota\u2019s east, not the oil country in the state\u2019s west, Burgum is an unlikely champion for the energy industry. When he first ran for governor in 2016 against the state\u2019s\u00a0then-attorney general, Burgum received virtually no donations from energy companies, and blasted his rival for taking money from an industry he was in charge of regulating. Burgum quickly changed his tune after he won the GOP primary that year, accepting more than $100,000 in donations from the industry for his campaign and inaugural committee, the Associated Press reported at the time. At his inauguration dinner, he sat next to two oil industry executives whose company was the event\u2019s largest sponsor, according to the AP. Pipeline backed by GOP megadonors Now, Burgum\u2019s looming decision on the multibillion-dollar\u00a0pipeline project is putting him in the middle of competing pressures from his political benefactors and constituents who are fighting efforts to build on their land. Summit Carbon Solutions, the company that plans to build 2,500 miles\u00a0of pipeline across five states, has pitched it as a way to trap carbon dioxide from ethanol plants around the Midwest and store the gas deep underground in North Dakota, preventing the emissions from accelerating climate change. It would be the world\u2019s largest carbon capture system, according to the company. The project, known as the Midwest Carbon Express, is set to benefit from financial incentives for carbon capture included in President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 which Burgum and Trump have opposed. Summit could receive up to $1.5 billion\u00a0annually in tax credits thanks to the law. Summit was founded by Summit Agricultural Group, a company led by Iowa GOP megadonor Bruce Rastetter, who\u2019s given millions of dollars to Trump and other Republican campaigns. He was reportedly considered by Trump\u2019s 2016 transition team as a candidate for agriculture secretary. One of Summit\u2019s largest investors is Continental Resources, an oil company owned by Harold Hamm, who is seen in North Dakota as a close Burgum ally. According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Continental, the state\u2019s largest oil producer, expects to own about a fourth of Summit\u2019s parent company after investments are complete. Continental gave $250,000 to a pro-Burgum super PAC last year and $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC this year. Hamm also donated $50 million toward Burgum\u2019s effort to build a presidential library honoring Theodore Roosevelt in North Dakota. Burgum praised him in his state of the state address last year, comparing Hamm to Roosevelt and declaring that his \u201cgrit, resilience, hard work and determination has changed North Dakota and our nation.\u201d Burgum also personally made between $15,000 and $50,000 from\u00a0Continental through an oil lease on land owned by his family between 2022 and mid-2023, according to the financial disclosure he filed as a presidential candidate. The lease was signed years before Burgum became governor. CNBC first reported on Burgum\u2019s financial ties with Continental, and the Associated Press previously reported on the politics of the Summit pipeline debate. Rob Lockwood, a Burgum spokesperson, said that \u201ctens of thousands of families and mineral owners have similar arrangements\u201d to Burgum\u2019s deal with Continental. Another investor in the Summit project, Gary Tharaldson, also gave the pro-Burgum super PAC $1 million last year, making him one of the group\u2019s\u00a0largest donors. Tharaldson runs a major ethanol company that is set to provide carbon dioxide for the pipeline, and is North Dakota\u2019s richest resident, according to Forbes. (Burgum is worth at least $100 million, the publication estimated \u2013 and he has spent millions of his own fortune on his gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.) A spokesperson for Rastetter declined to comment, while spokespeople for Hamm and Tharaldson did not respond to requests for comment. Since he endorsed Trump earlier this year, Burgum has become a key figure connecting the former president\u2019s campaign with wealthy oil executives like Hamm, according to two sources familiar with the situation. At one Trump fundraiser in April that Hamm and Burgum attended, Trump urged assembled oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign, and Burgum said at another fundraiser that Trump would \u201cstop the hostile attack against all American energy,\u201d the Washington Post reported. Some political observers have pointed to Burgum\u2019s close relationship with oil executives like Hamm as a key reason why a governor who\u2019s little-known outside his state has made it to Trump\u2019s vice-presidential short list. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is Doug Burgum has realized that he could really hitch his wagon to Harold Hamm,\u201d said Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, a nonprofit energy watchdog in the state. \u201cThat will get him elected. That will get him to places. But to do that, he\u2019s going to have to flip-flop. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s done\u2026 He has shifted completely on oil and gas and coal and everything.\u201d Lockwood, the Burgum spokesperson, said that since he took office, the governor has \u201cconsistently and steadfastly supported coal, oil and gas as essential pieces of an all-of-the-above energy approach that is good for the US economy, grid reliability, and national security.\u201d Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it seemed unlikely that Burgum would have to recuse himself from the pipeline decision based on the investors\u2019 political donations or oil money the governor is receiving from Continental. But she said it could raise questions about whether Burgum is \u201cso entangled with these individuals and their companies \u2013 from a political and financial perspective \u2013 that he really can\u2019t serve the public interest.\u201d More broadly, Trump\u2019s vice-presidential search seems a little like \u201can \u2018Apprentice\u2019 exercise \u2013 who\u2019s going to bring in the most money for him,\u201d Canter said. \u201cBurgum is playing to win here, but at what cost?\u201d Burgum in the middle Summit\u2019s pipeline project will likely depend on support from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, a three-person body chaired by Burgum that also includes two other Republican elected officials, the state Attorney General Drew Wrigley, and Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring. The commission is expected to vote this fall\u00a0on whether to grant Summit a permit for subsurface storage of carbon dioxide, which would allow it to use amalgamation, a form of eminent domain, to force property owners into a deal with the company. So far, Burgum has avoided taking a stance on eminent domain, suggesting that if landowners don\u2019t want to sign a deal with the company, Summit could convince their neighbors instead. \u201cI support private property rights,\u201d he said at an Iowa event during his presidential campaign last year, in response to a question from a pipeline opponent. \u201cJust say no, and they\u2019ll move it to your neighbor and your neighbor can get the big check.\u201d The governor has been vocally supportive of the project as a whole. At a 2022 event where he sat alongside Rastetter, Hamm and Tharaldson, Burgum declared that the \u201centrepreneurs that are stepping up and investing in these kinds of projects, I think, are the real heroes of the American economy.\u201d His administration has also helped the project move forward, Forbes reported in 2022, including by petitioning the federal government to let the state oversee carbon dioxide injection wells. In 2019 \u2013 the same year that Summit began developing plans for the project \u2013 the state legislature passed a law allowing oil and gas operators to use the \u201cpore space\u201d beneath the land and preventing landowners from demanding they be compensated for it. The bill was strongly pushed by Burgum\u2019s administration, said state Sen. Jeff Magrum, a conservative Republican who has clashed with Burgum and opposes the pipeline project. The state Supreme Court later struck down the law. Summit\u2019s proposal has created unlikely alliances in North Dakota politics, uniting left-wing and right-wing groups in opposition, with Burgum\u2019s more business-minded wing of the GOP in support. Environmental groups have raised alarms about safety and water concerns from the Summit project, and also suggested that the carbon dioxide could eventually be used for oil drilling in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken Formation, where Hamm\u2019s company has a significant presence \u2013 ultimately prolonging the life of a polluting energy source. Summit has said there are no plans for the carbon dioxide to be used for drilling, and its business model is based on sequestering the gas underground. Conservatives, meanwhile, have focused on property rights.\u00a0A majority of the state GOP convention voted for a resolution objecting to the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines this spring, although the resolution failed to pass because it fell a few votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority. \u201cIt\u2019s been strange to see the different groups that have come together,\u201d said Derrick Braaten, a North Dakota lawyer who\u2019s representing dozens of landowners opposed to the project. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the Sierra Club and the Farm Bureau \u2013 diametrically opposed organizations \u2013 walking hand in hand making the same arguments against this. You don\u2019t know what world you live in anymore.\u201d Holdouts in pipeline project\u2019s path In recent weeks, Summit has faced several highly contentious permit hearings, in which landowners in the rural central North Dakota counties where the company plans to lay pipelines and bury its carbon dioxide complained of feeling \u201cbullied by billionaires.\u201d \u201cIt just turns our property into a landfill, or a hazardous waste site,\u201d Mike Bauman, whose family farm is in the pipeline\u2019s proposed path, said in an interview. He accused Summit of aggressive negotiation tactics, relying on the threat of eminent domain. Bauman, whose job involves land negotiations for the federal government, said that \u201cif I did any of the negotiations that these guys do \u2013 threatening that I\u2019m just going to seize and take your property \u2013 I would no longer have a job, nor would I even be probably sitting in normal society.\u201d \u201cHow can the state of North Dakota allow a private organization to take someone\u2019s property for their own personal benefit and not be for public use?\u201d Bauman asked. A Summit spokesperson\u00a0declined to comment on the criticism the project has received or the company\u2019s negotiation tactics. At the public hearings, company executives have emphasized its economic benefits and noted that they changed the proposed pipeline route in response to local concerns. According to Summit, the company has already signed easements with landowners covering 83% of the pipeline route and leases covering 92% of the land area that would be used to store carbon dioxide. Supporters say it will be an economic driver for North Dakota and help reduce emissions across the Midwest. \u201cThe benefits of it outweigh the risk, and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at with this project,\u201d said state Sen. Terry Wanzek, a Republican who is backing the project due to his support for the ethanol industry. \u201cWe present ourselves with a lot of opportunity.\u201d The debate over the pipeline has even divided some families. Mike Haupt, who owns farmland in Mercer County, N.D., said that some of his relatives are \u201cshunning\u201d him and his wife after they rejected Summit\u2019s proposal for an easement on their land. \u201cWe decided that this is not constitutional to come and take somebody\u2019s property without negotiations,\u201d Haupt said. The anger of some landowners \u2013 and the political danger for Burgum \u2013 was on display at a hearing last month that a state official called \u201cone of the most contentious\u201d he\u2019d ever seen, the North Dakota Monitor reported. Kurt Swenson, who owns about 1,400 acres in central North Dakota where the company aims to store carbon dioxide, told state regulators that the project threatens to permanently destroy the prairie grassland where his wife\u2019s family has lived for more than a century. \u201cThe state can try and take it,\u201d Swenson declared at the hearing. \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up taking it from my cold, dead hands.\u201d In an interview, Swenson said he had voted for Burgum twice and had once considered him a strong conservative \u2013 but after the governor\u2019s support for the pipeline project, he didn\u2019t want to see him elevated to national office. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly changed from how he put himself out to be initially,\u201d Swenson said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_trump-vp-speculation-miami-rally", "text": "Throughout the week of the presidential debate, some members of former President Donald Trump\u2019s team were already beginning to focus on\u00a0another potentially big race-defining\u00a0event: the roll out of his vice-presidential pick. There are not\u00a0signs and merchandise featuring the names of Trump\u2019s potential contenders sitting in a warehouse waiting to be shared with his supporters.\u00a0Any plotting\u00a0of the potential announcement or rollout has been handled with enormous secrecy so as not to tip off speculation about the selection. But last week, aides and production staff were sent to Trump\u2019s Doral resort in Miami to build out a space for a rally scheduled for July\u00a09.\u00a0The timing and proximity of the rally to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s home \u2013 sure to ignite predictions about Trump\u2019s selection \u2013 was purely coincidental, sources familiar with the event planning told CNN. Rubio, along with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, sit atop Trump\u2019s shortlist for the job. Still, among staff and allies, speculation has raged as to whether the Miami event would feature Trump\u2019s long-awaited announcement. And even those closest to the former president continue to insist they are in the dark as to who his ultimate choice will be. Advisers stressed that regardless of the planning around events, the former president would have the final word on where and when his vice presidential pick would be announced. Trump has given himself until the Republican convention in Milwaukee later this month to make a pick and recently told a Virginia television station he will be \u201cmaking a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\u201d \u201cAs President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who will make a great President for eight years after his next four-year term concludes. But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump,\u201d Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes told CNN. As another person close to Trump put it: \u201cWe can put whatever we want together and hand it to him on the platter and he could say no thanks. It\u2019s not happening until it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d This statement came to pass Monday, when Trump allies noted a change in posture following the debate. Two sources close to the former president said the option of Trump waiting until the convention begins to announce his choice is under consideration again. President Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s poor performance at Thursday\u2019s debate has further fueled the persistent questions about his fitness for office. As the Democratic hand wringing dominates the post-debate narrative, Trump decided to spend this entire week at his Bedminster golf resort with no public appearances. Some of his campaign staff was told \u2013 to their surprise \u2013 that they should enjoy the 4th\u00a0of July weekend. VP jockeying Meanwhile, the jockeying to join Trump on the ticket has continued, unabated by the debate fallout. Advocates\u00a0for\u00a0Rubio were casting doubt on Burgum, and flagging that Burgum\u2019s record on abortion would bring the issue, which Trump has tried to separate himself from, back into the spotlight. Vance and Rubio, meanwhile, are friends in the Senate, though that hasn\u2019t stopped\u00a0supporters of each VP candidate from pushing negative attacks against the other. Allies of Vance have been continuing to promote Vance\u2019s ability to carry the MAGA torch, though some opposed to the Ohio senator also argue that his image as a Trump standard bearer, in addition to his youth, could work against him. Some Trump allies have also sought to emphasize that Trump and Rubio don\u2019t get along as well, in comparison to the former president\u2019s relationships with Burgum and Vance. They\u2019ve also been quick to point out the areas in which the two are out of step, including on some foreign policy areas and \u201cdeep state\u201d issues, as one person close to Trump phrased it. One Trump confidante told CNN he expects the former president\u2019s team is preparing for the unlikely scenario Biden exits the race \u2013 an outcome that, however unlikely, could spark new considerations for his running mate. \u201cI\u2019d drag this out for two weeks,\u201d the confidante told CNN. \u201cLet Biden twist.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/trump-vp-speculation-miami-rally/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_donald-trump-winning-streak", "text": "Donald Trump used to tell his fans that he\u2019d win so much, they\u2019d get tired of winning. This week, that might be true for once. President Joe Biden\u2019s incoherent and painful debate performance in Atlanta on Thursday night gave Trump a massive victory in the most pivotal moment of the 2024 White House campaign so far as he seeks to win a non-consecutive second term and pull off a stunning political comeback. Trump basked in the aftermath of the debate during a rally on Friday in Virginia and drew a link between what he said was the \u201cdecline\u201d of both his opponent and America. \u201cAs every American saw firsthand last night, this election is a choice between strength and weakness, competence and incompetence, peace and prosperity, war or no war,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said. Hours after the debate, a US Supreme Court ruling that the Justice Department overstepped in charging January 6 Capitol rioters handed the presumptive Republican nominee what he immediately hailed on social media as a \u201cBIG WIN.\u201d The 6-3 decision was a symbolic victory for the ex-president the day after he used the debate to try to whitewash the worst attack on democracy in modern times. There could also be legal ramifications with some scholars arguing the ruling could narrow the scope of Trump\u2019s federal election interference trial, even if special counsel Jack Smith believes his case can proceed unaffected. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers are already signaling they will seek to get evidence tossed and obstruction counts against the ex-president dismissed. The court released its decision ahead of an even more critical case that will bear more directly on Trump\u2019s criminal entanglements. On Monday, justices are expected to finally rule on his expansive claim of immunity for acts committed while president. If the long-awaited ruling by the conservative-majority court mandates new litigation in a lower court, it could have the effect of pushing Smith\u2019s election interference trial well beyond November\u2019s election even if it does not immediately curtail aspects of the special counsel\u2019s prosecution. Trump\u2019s year of peaks and disasters With Trump eyeing a return to the White House, the justices\u2019 evaluation of never-before-considered arguments on the limits of executive power is especially critical given his controversial belief that he would enjoy near unfettered authority in the Oval Office that would effectively place the presidency above the law. There was more good legal news for Trump in Florida, as federal Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed, on Thursday plunged deeper into pretrial litigation in the case over his alleged handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The way Cannon has overseen the case \u2013 and her frequent clashes with Smith\u2019s team \u2013 have already ensured that another one of Trump\u2019s criminal indictments will not go to trial before the election. And like the federal election interference case, the documents matter is one that a Trump-appointed attorney general in a second administration would have the power to dismiss. A second 2020 election case, in Georgia, is also stalled \u2013 partly over a controversy and appeals process triggered by a relationship between District Attorney Fani Willis and a prosecutor she appointed. There have been plenty of grim weeks for Trump this year, especially over the weekslong hush money trial that resulted in him becoming the first ex-president and major party presumptive nominee to be found guilty of a crime. And on July 11, his humiliation will be reinforced when he attends sentencing in New York before Judge Juan Merchan. His enforced attendance will epitomize his year of personal and political troughs and highs as it will take place just days before the ex-president travels to the Republican National Convention to formally accept his third consecutive presidential nomination. Trump is also expected to use the event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to unveil his vice-presidential nominee. There are still four months until the election \u2013 a span of political time that could see unforeseen events and crises at home and abroad that could transform the race. But Thursday night\u2019s debate could hardly have gone better for Trump, who has been locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden with a slight edge in the swing states that will decide the election. While it\u2019s too early to assess how voters will respond, the president\u2019s disastrous performance unleashed despair among Democrats now questioning whether Biden should remain on the ticket. Even if Biden manages to bounce back, his campaign will never be able to erase the impressions of millions of television viewers who saw an elderly man struggling to compete sentences, losing his train of thought and gaping in apparent open-mouthed confusion at Trump \u2013 who cut a more vigorous, if deceitful, figure. The optics of the night helped reinforce a Republican narrative that the 81-year-old president is suffering from compromised cognition and the views of a majority of Americans that he\u2019s too old to serve a second term. Biden\u2019s struggles also gave Trump a free pass on a night when his gusher of lies and conspiracy theories showed that if anything, he\u2019s become more vengeful and threatening to the rule of law since he left office in disgrace after a chaotic one-term presidency in January 2021. A more effective presidential performance in the debate might have inflicted terminal damage on Trump\u2019s campaign. But while Biden failed his test of vitality at the debate, the ex-president\u2019s generally calm demeanor in the critical early exchanges meant that he did not play into Biden\u2019s accusations that he is \u201cunhinged\u201d and that something has \u201csnapped\u201d in him. While the president did manage to highlight Trump\u2019s extreme behavior and falsehoods later in the evening, the initial sparring was so devastating to Biden that his successes may have passed many voters by. Trump is only three years younger than Biden and often lapses into gibberish in campaign events. But polls show that voters worry less about his mental faculties and age. Many senior Democrats publicly argued on Friday that a bad debate did not mean that the reality of the election \u2013 involving a Republican candidate who has already sought to destroy democracy and might do so again \u2013 has not changed. Yet the stark truth for Biden is that his fumbling performance will only exacerbate concerns of many voters who cannot imagine him fully executing a second term that would end when he is 86. The Supreme Court hands Trump more favorable news In the January 6 case the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Justice Department overstepped by bringing obstruction charges against hundreds of people who rioted at the Capitol. At least some of those cases are likely to be reopened. The high court did however rule that the charge could still be filed against the rioters if prosecutors are able to show they were attempting not just to push their way into the building, but rather to stop the certification of the 2020 election. This wrinkle may allow Smith to also maintain the same charge against Trump. Trump\u2019s team expects to file motions to get obstruction counts against the former president dismissed, a source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Paula Reid. Still, Smith\u2019s case against the presumptive GOP nominee is based on a more sweeping set of events and evidence than that arrayed against members of the pro-Trump mob. But even if a new legal gambit by Trump\u2019s team is successful in delaying proceedings with more litigation it would bolster his long-term goal of delaying the trial. As it is, there seems little chance a jury will hear the case in the coming months unless there is a blanket rejection by the high court of Trump\u2019s immunity claim next week. However, if Trump loses the election, and the case goes ahead unhindered, even the chance that his lawyers could narrow his criminal exposure could be immensely valuable to the ex-president. In the Florida documents case, Cannon said on Thursday that she wants to hold additional hearings on Trump\u2019s attempt to challenge key evidence and will allow his lawyers to question witnesses about the investigation and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents in 2022. Cannon has been accused of dragging out the case over multiple hearings. Some critics have put the delays down to her inexperience. Others have suggested that she\u2019s operating out of favoritism to the president who appointed her. But in an 11-page order Thursday, the judge rebuked critics. \u201cThere is a difference between a resource-wasting and delay-producing \u2018mini-trial,\u2019 on the one hand, and an evidentiary hearing geared to adjudicating the contested factual and legal issues on a given pre-trial motion to suppress,\u201d Cannon wrote. As far as Trump is concerned, Cannon can string out the case as long as she wants, especially if it keeps his favorable recent good run going.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/donald-trump-winning-streak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_supreme-court-term-trump-favor", "text": "Just as the Supreme Court was heading into its final arguments of what would become a dramatic and historic term, Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued a plea to her warring colleagues. \u201cThis is not the time to amplify disagreement,\u201d Barrett, a conservative and the second-most-junior justice, scolded the court\u2019s liberal wing in a decision allowing former President Donald Trump to appear on presidential ballots despite his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cWritings on the court should turn the national temperature down, not up.\u201d Four months later, it seems no one took her advice. In a decision Monday granting sweeping immunity to Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts accused the liberal dissenters of \u201cfear mongering\u201d and \u201cignoring\u201d fundamental constitutional principles. In an unusually hostile dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor dispensed with the traditional nod to \u201crespectfully\u201d disagreeing and instead noted her \u201cfear for our democracy.\u201d As the early-in-the-term bonhomie smashed up against politically fraught legal questions, the six conservative justices lined up against the three liberals in significant cases overturning a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, severely reducing the power of federal agencies to approve regulations, and giving cities and states more power to punish people who are homeless from sleeping outside. Even when they agreed on the bottom line, such as in a June decision that upheld a federal law aimed at disarming domestic abusers, they split sharply in a series of concurrences over the reasoning of their decisions. Here are some key takeaways from the term: Trump got the term Biden wanted For years, Trump had an at-best spotty record on a high court that he largely helped to build, with the court\u2019s conservatives breaking with him on the 2020 election and his tax records. This term, the former president got the Supreme Court he always wanted. A 6-3 majority ruled that Trump had broad immunity from prosecution for official actions he took in office, making it unlikely he would face trial in\u00a0special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case until after the November election \u2013 if at all. Trump named three justices to the court during his four years in office \u2013 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett. In the majority immunity decision on Monday, all three sided with the court\u2019s underlying conclusion. That wasn\u2019t the only win for Trump this term. In March, the court ruled that he could appear on presidential primary ballots despite a claim that he violated the \u201cinsurrectionist clause\u201d in the 14th Amendment for his actions on January 6, 2021. And late last month, the court limited the power of prosecutors to pursue obstruction charges against those who rioted at the US Capitol that day, narrowing the scope of a law that could have tacked years onto sentences. Trump claimed victory in that outcome, with his campaign seizing on the political message it helps him make about the Justice Department. Biden, on the other hand, had an especially difficult term. The court blocked his proposal to reduce smog and air pollution, overturned a bump stock ban that Trump had implemented and Biden defended, and severely limited the ability of the federal government to approve regulations. The administration did post some wins, notably in two abortion cases and a major gun rights appeal. Justices dodge abortion fights after unwinding Roe The justices dodged major legal questions posed by two bombshell abortion cases, with the court sweeping away one of its biggest controversies in an election year through technicalities. In one case \u2013 a challenge to the availability of a drug used for medication abortion, which makes up two-thirds of all abortions in the country \u2013 a unanimous court ruled that the anti-abortion doctors and medical associations that filed the lawsuit did not clear a procedural threshold known as \u201cstanding.\u201d That means that the doctors and groups weren\u2019t harmed by the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s expanded access to mifepristone in a way that permitted them to challenge it. \u201cWe recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote for a unanimous court. \u201cBut citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities \u2013 at least without the plaintiffs demonstrating how they would be injured by the government\u2019s alleged under-regulation of others.\u201d A second case dealt with abortion access in medical emergencies, and a bare majority of justices determined that the court had taken up the dispute over Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prematurely. Four justices \u2013 three stalwart conservatives and one liberal \u2013 dissented from the punt and accused the majority of depriving the country of much-needed resolution to the question of whether a federal emergency care law trumps strict state abortion bans. In one sense, the decisions represented another political win for Trump. Democrats have been able to organize, raise money and move votes based on the court\u2019s decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion. By backing away from the abortion decisions this term, it may make it harder for progressives to keep that issue front and center in an election year. Boomerang term sets up repeat battles on guns, abortion The Supreme Court, in many ways, is stuck in 2022. That\u2019s the year the conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade and vastly expanded gun rights. Echoes of those rulings featured prominently on the court\u2019s docket this year, and the latest decisions will almost certainly bring back both issues again \u2013 eventually. An 8-1 majority upheld a federal law that bans people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. While that was a significant win for the Biden administration, the court made exceedingly clear that a series of related gun control measures will be vulnerable to challenge in short order. On Tuesday, the court declined to hear oral arguments next term on cases dealing with gun ownership for nonviolent felons and people addicted to drugs as well as bans on \u201cassault-style\u201d weapons in Illinois. But the justices sent many of those matters back to lower courts, meaning those same issues will almost certainly return. A punt in two First Amendment cases challenging state laws that attempted to regulate social media will likely return to the high court. And the decision about Trump\u2019s immunity may also wind up thrusting procedural questions about Smith\u2019s election subversion charges back on the court\u2019s plate. Abortion, too, seems destined to return because the court declined to resolve the central questions in each dispute. In the medication abortion case, three conservative states have intervened to push forward with the legal attack on the drug, vowing to take the case back up to the high court. The emergency abortion case will play out in lower courts. If Trump wins another term, however, both abortion cases could be moot. Trump, for instance, could withdraw regulatory moves that made abortion drugs easier to obtain. His Justice Department could also rescind government guidance to hospitals that interprets federal law as obligating emergency abortion in states that ban the procedure. Justice Barrett strikes out on her own It often takes several terms for a Supreme Court justice to find their voice. Barrett, who took the bench in October 2020, showed a streak of independence in her fourth term that some of her critics may have found surprising. That was particularly notable in the immunity decision, in which Barrett departed from her colleagues on a technical but potentially significant question of whether a jury can even consider evidence of Trump\u2019s official actions in a potential trial. Barrett raised concerns that decision could \u201chamstring the prosecution.\u201d \u201cThe Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which presidents can be held liable,\u201d she wrote. In the Idaho abortion case, it was Barrett who wrote a concurring opinion for the court\u2019s more centrist conservatives, including Roberts and Kavanaugh, that offered the clearest explanation for the unsettled outcome. More to the point, it was the position she had raised during oral arguments in that case in April that the court ultimately appeared to embrace. Her argument was that Idaho\u2019s abortion law no longer appeared to conflict with the Biden administration\u2019s federal guidance on emergency abortions. \u201cWhat\u2019s the conflict?\u201d Barrett demanded from the attorney representing Idaho. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d While the court sometimes resolved cases with lopsided majorities, there was considerable disagreement about the reasoning of some of those decisions. Supreme Court-style scraps repeatedly broke out in concurrences over how to think about history when deciding cases and over the plain meaning of the text of the laws involved. Barrett was at the center of many of those disputes. In perhaps the most notable example, the former law professor and appeals court judge sided with two liberal justices in a dissent from the court\u2019s decision to narrow a felony obstruction charge federal prosecutors filed against hundreds of people involved in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. At the center of that case was a former Pennsylvania police officer, Joseph Fischer, who briefly pushed his way into the Capitol. Writing for a six-justice majority, Roberts ran through a text-heavy analysis of the law, parsing meaning from the word \u201cotherwise\u201d and relying on \u201ccommon sense intuition\u201d to glean that Congress couldn\u2019t have possibly meant to tuck so broad a prohibition into a law enacted in response to evidence tampering after the 2001 Enron scandal. But Barrett quickly waved aside that analysis, breaking with her conservative colleagues on what it means to read the plain meaning of a law. Fischer\u2019s case, she asserted, should have been an \u201copen and shut\u201d matter. \u201cSo why does the Court hold otherwise?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause it simply cannot believe that Congress meant what it said.\u201d Dogged by ethics controversies Last year, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct in a response to a barrage of criticism about the off-bench activities of some justices, namely Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. If the hope was that the document would take ethics out of the limelight, it failed. For a second year in a row, the final months of the court\u2019s session were dominated by the ethics controversies that plagued some members of the bench almost as much as its caseload. Congressional Democrats repeatedly called on Thomas to recuse himself from the cases concerning Trump because of efforts by the conservative justice\u2019s wife to reverse the 2020 election in Trump\u2019s favor. Thomas, the court\u2019s longest-serving member, rebuffed those appeals. Alito, too, was shrouded in controversy again this year, with the conservative justice also rejecting calls for his recusal in the cases concerning the 2020 election and Capitol attack that came after media reports documenting two provocative flags raised at his properties: an upside-down US flag hoisted at his home in Virginia in early 2021 and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his New Jersey home last summer. Both flags became symbols for Trump\u2019s supporters and were carried by January 6 rioters, though Alito said that was not the message the flags were intended to convey. Alito pinned responsibility on his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, and later told Democratic lawmakers who urged him to recuse himself that the flag controversies \u201cdo not meet the conditions for recusal\u201d put forth by the newly adopted ethics code. Weeks later, Alito and his wife were in the spotlight again after an activist critical of the court released secret recordings of conversations she had with the two during an event this spring. The woman, who represented herself as a religious conservative, goaded them into speaking candidly about a range of politically sensitive topics, with the justice at one point endorsing the idea that the country should be returned \u201cto a place of Godliness.\u201d Some ethics experts say the court\u2019s issues in that space undermine their decisions, particularly in hot-button cases. \u201cYou would assume that ethics and jurisprudence go hand-in-hand in that so long as the first one is buttoned up, the majority of the country will not be questioning as much the second part of that equation. But that\u2019s not where we\u2019re at,\u201d said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, which has pushed for more transparency from the federal judiciary. \u201cEthics is continuing to be a major issue. And it\u2019s continuing to erode the legitimacy of the court and the trust in the court,\u201d Roth added. \u201cUntil these issues are put to rest, they\u2019re going to continue to dog the nine of them.\u201d Shrinking regulatory agency power Several major rulings from the court\u2019s conservative bloc will make it harder for agencies to defend regulations in court, shifting power away from the executive branch and into the judiciary. For the conservative legal movement, the rulings were milestone victories in the war against the so-called administrative state. In scorching dissents, the liberal justices accused the majority of a power grab that kneecaps Congress\u2019 ability to address evolving and complicated problems. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in a pair of cases dealing with a fishing regulation were arguably the most consequential this term for determining how the federal government functions. Roberts, writing for an ideologically divided 6-3 court, overruled a decades-old precedent that instructed courts, in disputes over regulations, to defer to the agency interpretation of a statute if the law was unclear. That practice was known as \u201cChevron deference,\u201d based on the 1984 decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The deeply entrenched precedent in Chevron touched on all areas of regulatory law, meaning its reversal will invite litigation against scores of agency rules, and gives judges a more central role in deciding the nuances of a regulatory statute. The court also ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission must handle fraud claims in court rather than with in-house tribunals, saying it was unconstitutional for the SEC to use an internal administrative process to enforce security fraud law. Finally, in a 6-3 decision issued Monday, the court also essentially extended the statute of limitations for when lawsuits against government regulations can be filed. Tied with the Chevron decision, critics say that could open the floodgates of litigation over federal regulations. \u201cAt the end of a momentous term, this much is clear,\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in dissent. \u201cThe tsunami of lawsuits against agencies that the court\u2019s holdings \u2026 have authorized has the potential to devastate the functioning of the federal government.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/supreme-court-term-trump-favor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_medal-of-honor-union-soldiers", "text": "Two Union soldiers from the American Civil War were posthumously awarded with the Medal of Honor by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, more than 160 years after being executed for their part in a daring mission against the Confederacy. \u201cPrivate Philip G. Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for their gallantry and intrepidity while participating in a covert military operation 200 miles behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862,\u201d a White House official said Wednesday morning. \u201cIn one of the earliest special operations in US Army history, Union Soldiers dressed as civilians infiltrated the Confederacy, hijacked a train in Georgia and drove it north for 87 miles, destroying enemy infrastructure along the way.\u201d Biden awarded the medals in a ceremony at the White House with descendants of Shadrach and Wilson in attendance. \u201cTomorrow is the Fourth of July \u2014\u00a0another reminder of why it\u2019s so important to know our history, not to erase our history. To remember the sacred cause of American democracy, and not make up a lost cause to justify evil of slavery. To remember the nation that George and Philip fought for and died for, the United States of America,\u201d Biden said during the ceremony. \u201cThat\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s who we are. The United States of America. There\u2019s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity in the United States if we work together.\u201d His remarks come as the president is under intense scrutiny for his performance in last week\u2019s presidential debate. His son, Hunter Biden, who was recently found guilty on three felony gun charges, was also in attendance at Wednesday\u2019s ceremony. Shadrach and Wilson were members of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 when they joined 20 other Union soldiers, and two civilians, to infiltrate Confederate territory. The raid, according to\u00a0the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, involved the soldiers commandeering a locomotive known as the\u00a0General\u00a0that was on its way toward Chattanooga. They would stop occasionally along the route to \u201ctear up track, switches, and bridges, inflicting as much damage as possible.\u201d The Confederates began chasing the General\u00a0in handcars and locomotives, at some points even on foot, eventually catching up to them and forcing the Union soldiers to abandon it. They were all captured within two weeks, and found guilty of \u201cacts of unlawful belligerency,\u201d according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Both the General and the Texas \u2014 one of the pursuing locomotives \u2014\u00a0survived and are in museums in Georgia; the General in Kennesaw\u2019s Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, and the Texas in the Atlanta History Center. Dr. Shane Makowicki, a US Army historian and expert in the American Civil War, told reporters that both Shadrach and Wilson were convicted as spies, and then executed by hanging. Telling the story of the raid on Wednesday, Biden said the two soldiers \u201cstood tall\u201d on the day of their execution. \u201cAccording to reports from that day, this is what he said \u2014\u00a0looked at the crowd, and he said he believed they were wrong, but he did not harbor hostility toward the people of the South. He said it was not them, but their leaders who were responsible for the rebellion. And he said the time would come when the Union would be restored and the American flag would wave over the entire nation once again,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, \u2018till the very end, George and Philip believed in the United States of America.\u201d \u201cThis is absolutely (a story) of intense dedication and commitment, intense bravery and comradery amongst the group of men that had only known each other for a short time, who believed in the mission and believed in the sacrifice and what they were doing to preserve the union,\u201d Kim Chandler, Wilson\u2019s great-great-great-granddaughter, told reporters on Tuesday. The operation is now known as the Great Locomotive Chase. While other members of the raid received the Medal of Honor sooner \u2014\u00a0six of whom after being released in a prisoner exchange in 1863 \u2014\u00a0Brad Quinlin, another historian who assisted in the effort to get Shadrach and Wilson recognized, said bad timing was primarily to blame for the delay in Shadrach and Wilson\u2019s recognition. In the aftermath of the raid, he said, their officers were promoted into different units and moved on. \u201cIt was just at that moment during our history, nobody was there to stand up for them and move this through, even their comrades who made the visits to Chattanooga and dedicated the monument to the Great Locomotive Chase in 1890, I don\u2019t think they even realized that these two men never had the medal. The paperwork never got through,\u201d Quinlin said. \u201cThere was nothing anywhere in any of my research, any documentation that said these men did not do what the others have done,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir bravery, their dignity, and their dedication to the Republic was exactly the same.\u201d Brian Taylor, Shadrach\u2019s great-great-great-nephew, told reporters the posthumous award is the culmination of \u201ca lot of very hard work\u201d for his family \u2014\u00a0including efforts by his father to contact President Jimmy Carter. \u201cHe was sending stuff to Jimmy Carter years ago, sometimes getting information back and sometimes getting ignored,\u201d Taylor said. Quinlin said he was pulled into the fight to get Shadrach and Wilson medals in April 2012 by Ron Shadrach, a great cousin of the Civil War private. It took 12 years of \u201cresearching, finding new documents, primary sources, and submitting the documentation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just something that needed to be done,\u201d Ron Shadrach said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/medal-of-honor-union-soldiers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_joe-biden-campaign-crisis", "text": "President\u00a0Joe Biden needs to do far more to quell Democratic panic over his terrible performance at his debate showdown with\u00a0former President\u00a0Donald Trump, and fast. After Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett on Tuesday became the first\u00a0Democratic\u00a0lawmaker to break ranks\u00a0and\u00a0demand Biden step aside, top party figures\u00a0are now asking for more\u00a0openness and details on the president\u2019s health and mental state as the anxiety about his reelection campaign evolves into an increasingly genuine threat to his grip on the Democratic nomination. Every effort the president and his White House and campaign teams make to fix the problem end up exacerbating it. Biden, for instance, on Tuesday evening\u00a0joked to\u00a0donors that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d with Trump after two grueling trips to Europe last month. It was an odd way to parry claims that he is no longer fit for the demanding duties of his office as he asks for a second term at age 81. The fallout from the debate has created another extraordinary twist in a stunning campaign featuring two presidents, one who is a convicted felon, and the other who is already the oldest to hold the job in history. The debate crystalized many fears of Democrats about Biden\u2019s prospects and played into months of claims by Trump, 78, that his rival is weak and mentally diminished. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0endured a briefing that was almost as painful to watch as the debate itself. She said that while Biden had a cold at the debate, he hadn\u2019t taken medication but was now feeling better. But she declined to go beyond Biden\u2019s already released annual physical results that found him fit for duty in February. The explanations did not account for why Biden trailed off in some answers, sometimes appeared incoherent and stared\u00a0open-mouthed\u00a0while Trump spoke during the CNN debate. Biden\u2019s team also keeps answering the wrong question. \u201cThe best predictor of future behavior is past performance,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, stressing that the true test of Biden capabilities was his record in office for the past 3\u00bd years. But the issue that was really posed by the debate was whether voters can imagine him \u2013 in his diminished current state \u2013 able to fully serve another term that would end when he is 86. Jean-Pierre insisted that \u201cwe understand how the American people are feeling. We get it, we do.\u201d But her briefing created only more intrigue about what really went on inside the president\u2019s tight inner circle. While the first cracks are appearing in the Democratic firewall around the president, the public calls for him to step aside\u00a0so the party can choose another nominee\u00a0are not yet anywhere near critical mass. But the calls by senior Democrats for more explanation from the president and for energy in his campaigning are now impossible for\u00a0Biden and his team\u00a0to ignore. And the ultimate outcome of the panic over Biden\u2019s performance is now not possible to predict \u2013 a hugely vulnerable position for a president seeking a second term. Democratic Sen. Peter Welch from Vermont said Tuesday:\u00a0\u201cThe big question going into that debate was the age question. \u2026 The outcome of the debate was that that question on age was intensified.\u201d \u201cWe have got to deal with that. That\u2019s the real issue, and have frank conversations about it, because at the end of the day, the existential question facing the Democratic Party is how do we keep Trump from being president \u2013 and whatever it takes, every decision each of us makes from President Biden down to a precinct captain in the South Side of Chicago should be through the lens of how best do we protect Democracy and protect America,\u201d Welch told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on \u201cNewsNight.\u201d Perhaps most importantly, the comparison between the wise, sober, statesmanlike Biden and the wild, lawless Trump\u00a0that\u00a0the president\u2019s campaign had anticipated for months has been obliterated by speculation over Biden\u2019s health and endurance. Biden needed to use the debate to turn around a race he was in danger of losing, and he may now have squandered his best chance to overtake the ex-president. Biden to sit for ABC interview In a new effort to calm public concern, Biden will grant an interview to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Friday in what is now shaping up as an even more critical test of his acuity than the debate. And he\u2019ll meet Democratic governors in Washington on Wednesday, both in person and virtually,\u00a0following demands for direct\u00a0contact\u00a0that underscored\u00a0the fact that\u00a0many Democrats believe Biden\u2019s inner circle has been remote and unresponsive to their concerns over a period of months. One of those governors, Kentucky\u2019s Andy Beshear, said in a remarkably candid interview with CNN on Tuesday that Biden\u2019s debate was \u201crough\u201d and that whatever the polls say, it will damage his campaign. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee, and ultimately that decision on continuing or not will fall to him and his family,\u201d Beshear, who\u2019s been mentioned as a potential replacement nominee if Biden backs out, told Pamela Brown. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking the president to talk to the American people a little bit more about his health or that debate performance.\u201d He added,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s like seeing somebody that you haven\u2019t seen in a while and they seem a little  off, and you asking how they\u2019re doing and then listening to their answer. It\u2019s both showing concern for them but also just trying to make sure that things are OK.\u201d Like Beshear, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi couched her comments by saying\u00a0Biden is\u00a0a great president and that Trump would\u00a0pose\u00a0a serious threat to the rule of\u00a0law. But\u00a0she also speculated on the president\u2019s health. \u201cI think it\u2019s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a\u00a0condition?\u201d she asked on MSNBC on Tuesday, adding that it was also a fair question to ask about the presumptive Republican nominee. A bad day started just after dawn Biden\u2019s political position deteriorated on Tuesday as dawn broke, when Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt that the president needed to understand that his decision on whether to stay in the race would reverberate for years to come and that the House and Senate were at stake. A few hours later, Doggett became the first Democratic lawmaker to call for Biden to relinquish the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cThere\u2019s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus,\u201d another House Democratic lawmaker told\u00a0CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar\u00a0on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside], but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d A new CNN/SSRS poll, meanwhile, showed that three-quarters of Americans believe Democrats would have a better chance of beating\u00a0Trump\u00a0with a candidate other than Biden. And even unpopular Vice President Kamala Harris fared better in the matchup with Trump than her boss. Another danger sign for the president is that despite his insistence that he will stay in the race, some Democrats are beginning to answer questions about what would happen if he was no longer the nominee \u2013 despite the extraordinary logistical challenges that would entail at the Democratic National Convention in August. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn \u2013 one of Biden\u2019s most vehement supporters \u2013 said on MSNBC on Tuesday that he still wanted to see the president on the top of the ticket. But he also offered support for the vice president. \u201cI will support her if he were to step aside,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cThis party should not in any way do anything to work around Miss Harris.\u201d He added: \u201cWe should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it\u2019s in second place or at the top of the ticket.\u201d Sen. Laphonza Butler also said she still backs Biden. But she offered a strong endorsement of her fellow Californian. \u201cI think she\u2019s done an incredible job being a partner to the president and leading the party and leading the country, and I think that she will continue to be that,\u201d Butler said. In his interview, Beshear \u2013 who, as a red-state governor, would draw vice presidential speculation on a different ticket \u2013 also had praise for Harris, saying he\u2019d been happy to work with a vice president whose initially shaky adaptation to the role means she would be far from a certainty to step up if Biden chose to leave the race. The CNN/SSRS poll shows Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup \u2013 trailing by 47% to 45%,\u00a0inside the margin of error.\u00a0Biden\u00a0was down\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0to the former president. But the vice president made sure there is no daylight between her and Biden during a brief interview with CBS News. \u201cJoe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d\u00a0she said, adding, \u201cI am proud to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/joe-biden-campaign-crisis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_biden-trump-supreme-court-debate-analysis", "text": "\u201cI dissent!\u201d President Joe Biden was offering a dramatic, direct response to an epochal Supreme Court ruling that could hand presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump a pass to unchecked power if he wins a second term. But Biden\u2019s defiance also conveyed a poignant image of a president refusing to be pushed off the greatest political stage after a disastrous debate performance revealed the ravages of age. Biden appeared Monday night in the majestic surroundings of the cross hall just inside the front-door of the White House, with the presidential seal behind him and marble pillars on either side. But his argument \u2014 that presidents aren\u2019t kings \u2014 was the opposite of regal. Biden said that the high court\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s sweeping claim to be shielded from prosecution over his bid to steal the 2020 election \u2014 finding that presidents are immune related to official acts \u2014 was dangerous and unprecedented. \u201cNow the American people will have to do what the court should have been willing to do and would not: Americans will have to render a judgment about Donald Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d Biden said. His address was both a major moment in the institutional history of the presidency and a calculated political gambit \u2014 the first step back from a ghastly and humiliating weekend filled by calls for him to abandon his presidential campaign. In four minutes, Biden, 81, encapsulated the two increasingly grave and urgent choices facing voters in November. \u2014 Will the country turn again to a 78-year-old former president with authoritarian instincts who believes that the Constitution gives him absolute power? \u2014 And does Biden, slowed by time\u2019s inexorable march and facing an existential personal political crisis have the strength to be the last barrier to Trump\u2019s autocratic ambitions? Biden\u2019s first attempt to rebound The president\u2019s appearance on Monday evening came after he returned from Camp David, where he\u2019d been staying since Saturday, surrounded by family members and assailed by speculation about his political future. Biden is braced for polls that will show whether his already tough path to reelection was further compromised by his hard-to-watch struggles on the debate stage. As a piece of political theater, the speech did nothing to quell the concerns about Biden\u2019s health, mental capacity and age raised by a painful showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta on Thursday when he sometimes looked vacant and was occasionally incoherent. Whether it was because of the ambient setting or a different type of television make-up, he looked bronzed and rested on Monday instead of wan and aged as he did in the debate. But even though he read from a teleprompter, the president\u2019s words were hurried together as those of older people sometimes are. And when he finished, the president ignored questions from a press pool. His delicate walk \u2014 almost a totter \u2014 back into the Blue Room underscored the loss of mobility that only reminds voters of his advancing years. Biden will require a higher volume and pace of public events and a level of energy and engagement for week after week to try to dispel the haunting images of a president, open mouthed and seemingly confused at last week\u2019s debate. Yet the forceful quality of Biden\u2019s delivery and the content of his words in the speech left no doubt of his convictions \u2014 even in far more manageable circumstances than a debate against the feral Trump. Monday\u2019s appearance was a classic example of how to deploy the imagery and rhetoric of the presidency. The court found that for \u201ccore\u201d presidential activity, Trump has the absolute immunity he had sought in a filing arising from his federal 2020 election interference case. The conservative majority said that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Justice Department, efforts to try to get officials on board with his effort to overturn the election, were covered with absolute immunity \u2013 a factor critics say could offer him an opening to use the department to seek reprisals against his personal enemies if he wins another term. For other official actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there is at least some immunity and largely deferred to lower courts to decide the scope. But Biden made a case for the presidency within the constraints of a constitutional system meant to contain executive power, not to unleash it. The irony of a president warning that the power of his own office must be circumscribed was consistent with the positions of all but a few US presidents who understood that the integrity of the public trust they held and American democracy depended on their restraint. Biden invoked George Washington, the first president, who established the tradition of willingly and peacefully ceding power that Trump abused four years ago, to argue that executive power is \u201climited not absolute.\u201d Presidential speeches don\u2019t need to be long to resonate. After all, the Gettysburg Address is only about 270 words long, depending on which transcription is used. And Biden\u2019s short first on-camera official appearance since the debate had its own punch and power. \u201cThe American people must decide whether Donald Trump\u2019s assault on our democracy on January 6 makes him unfit for public office in the highest office of land,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe American people must decide (whether) Trump\u2019s embrace of violence to preserve his power is acceptable. Perhaps most importantly, the American people must decide if they want to entrust the \u2026 presidency \u2026 once again \u2026 to \u2026 Donald Trump, now knowing he\u2019ll be more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it.\u201d Trump rages about the \u2018stench\u2019 from Biden \u2018hoaxes\u2019 Biden\u2019s measured reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling contrasted with the triumphant outburst of his predecessor that laid bare voters\u2019 choice in November. \u201cTHE SUPREME COURT DECISION IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL ONE THAN SOME HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE. IT IS BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN AND WISE, AND CLEARS THE STENCH FROM THE BIDEN TRIALS AND HOAXES, ALL OF THEM, THAT HAVE BEEN USED AS AN UNFAIR ATTACK ON CROOKED JOE BIDEN\u2019S POLITICAL OPPONENT, ME,\u201d the ex-president wrote on his Truth Social platform. \u201cMANY OF THESE FAKE CASES WILL NOW DISAPPEAR, OR WITHER INTO OBSCURITY. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d Trump\u2019s all-caps, self-obsession and false claims that he\u2019s a victim of politicized justice only reinforced Biden\u2019s arguments about the dangers he might present to democracy. But Trump\u2019s skill as a demagogue has convinced many of his supporters that Biden, and not the former president who refused to accept the result of an election, is the true threat to democracy. Trump has never hidden what he would do with enhanced executive power. After all, he has called for the termination of the Constitution in a social media post. During the pandemic in 2020, Trump declared falsely: \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.\u201d In his social media campaign apparently meant to sway the conservative majority on the Supreme Court before the judgment, the ex-president repeatedly said that without immunity for all acts, the presidency could not operate. And he\u2019s left no doubt that he\u2019d use a second term to pursue personal retribution. Those statements take on new significance given Monday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis was not the grand slam that Trump was looking for, but it was very close,\u201d former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, a CNN senior law enforcement analyst, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on said \u201cThe Source\u201d Monday. \u201cThe definition of immunity is so broad \u2026 that with the addition of the elimination of using any official conduct as evidence in a prosecution that targets unofficial conduct, really carves out a minuscule area of prosecution for any president or former president.\u201d That reality appears likely to give Trump even greater latitude for his expansive interpretation of presidential powers if he wins in November \u2014 a factor that Biden is beseeching voters to consider. He directed Americans to the views of liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who issued a searing dissent against the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision. \u201cI concur with Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent today. Here\u2019s what she said \u2026 \u2018In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u2019 end of quote. So should the American people dissent.\u201d \u201cI dissent,\u201d Biden said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/biden-trump-supreme-court-debate-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_biden-campaign-reelection-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden waged an intense weekend battle to save his reelection bid following\u00a0his disastrous debate performance\u00a0but has been unable to dismiss existential questions about his candidacy that are more glaring than ever. Biden is secluded with his family at Camp David following several events at which he tried to ease panic among Democratic voters, officials and donors after the debate multiplied concerns that he\u2019s too old to beat former President Donald Trump or to serve a second term. His weak and incoherent demeanor during Thursday night\u2019s event on CNN created an extraordinary twist in the campaign and left him facing calls to cede the stage to a younger candidate just over four months from Election Day. Biden\u2019s allies spent the weekend lashing out at critics in the media calling for him to step aside and insisting that early data showed that Biden\u2019s calamitous showing had not altered the fundamental shape of the race. Democratic Party grandees, meanwhile, crowded onto Sunday talk shows to try to put the spotlight back on Trump. \u201cLet us not make a judgment about a presidency on one debate,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what it means to people in their lives \u2026 the difference between Joe Biden and the former president is so clear.\u201d South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a longtime Biden supporter, admitted to Bash that his friend had a \u201cbad\u201d debate but put the blame on Biden being overloaded with facts by staffers. The president\u2019s family, who would be critical in any decisions on the campaign\u2019s future, currently believes Biden should stay in the race and keep fighting as they await polling data while braced for some erosion of his position, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee and Jeff Zeleny reported Sunday. Still, that view could shift if there is a downward spiral, and the president were to be convinced that leaving the race would be the best decision. One of the president\u2019s confidants, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Monday that Biden\u2019s blank, open-mouthed stares during the debate reflected\u00a0\u201ca president who is frankly thunderstruck by just how aggressively Donald Trump is lying about everything.\u201d \u201cI think everyone\u2019s entitled to have a bad night,\u201d Coons told Kasie Hunt, but added that Biden now needs to demonstrate \u201cmore unscripted and off the record moments.\u201d However, the Democratic damage control strategy of arguing that one bad night does not detract from Biden\u2019s past successes ignores the critical question with which many voters have wrestled for months: Is Biden simply too physically and cognitively diminished to serve another four years? Republicans are doubling down on the issue. \u201cAll of America saw it. And you know who else saw it? Our adversaries saw it. Putin saw it, Xi saw it, the Ayatollah saw it,\u201d North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a potential Trump vice presidential pick said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to the leaders of Russia, China and Iran. Top Democrats publicly back Biden There\u2019s so far no sign that the 81-year-old president is contemplating abandoning his campaign to make way for\u00a0a hurried attempt by the party\u00a0to find another candidate. \u201cJoe Biden is not going to take himself out of this race, nor should he,\u201d Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Since Biden is the presumptive nominee after dominating Democratic primaries, there\u2019s no realistic way for the party to move on unless the president decides it\u2019s time. Some party leaders fear a new nominating contest at this point would run the risk of setting off an internal civil war that could effectively hand Trump the presidency. Biden has meanwhile repeatedly insisted he\u2019s fit to serve. And any rising-star Democrat who did step up would be accused of betrayal by many in the party and would risk their own future careers. The president said at a fundraising event in New Jersey on Saturday night that he understood the concern, admitting he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a great night\u201d in Atlanta and walks more slowly and talks less smoothly than he used to. But he vowed to fight on. For now, Biden\u2019s team appears to have staved off the immediate danger to his campaign. His fundraising is still robust with more than $33 million raised in the days following the debate, according to his team. The heavy hitters willing to go on TV to defend him showed he\u2019s not yet lost his party \u2014 even if there\u2019s a full-grade meltdown going on behind the scenes. But any set of bad polls showing an already-tough reelection bid was seriously damaged by the debate could trigger panic again. And no modern president or presumptive nominee has faced anything comparable to the calls from usually-friendly media commentators who are now urging Biden to announce he won\u2019t accept the Democratic nomination in Chicago in August. CNN reported on Saturday that Democratic donors are split over whether to stick with Biden or to seek another nominee, however complicated that might be. Any sign that the president could also take down Democratic hopes of holding the Senate and winning back the House could bolster the case of those wanting change, especially after a week in which the Supreme Court has demonstrated just how fundamentally unchecked conservative rule can reshape the nation. The top bench is due to rule Monday on Trump\u2019s claim that he enjoyed immunity for actions as president \u2014 in a case that points to his belief that he will have almost unlimited powers if he wins a second term. Biden has put claims that Trump would destroy democracy at the center of his reelection bid, but his debate debacle is only raising fresh questions about whether the threat is so grave that Democrats should turn to a safer bet. One hint of a movement against Biden While top party figures are publicly standing with Biden \u2014 to do anything else would be seen as treachery \u2014 many Democrats were deeply shaken by Thursday night\u2019s debate. Many people in the party spent the weekend bemoaning the situation privately, several sources said, and are now viewing November\u2019s election with dread. Only one senior figure, however, has as much as hinted at movement against Biden behind the scenes. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin told MSNBC the party was having \u201ca very serious conversation about what to do.\u201d Raskin added: \u201cRegardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified, and our party also needs him at the very center of our deliberations in our campaign.\u201d Raskin continued, \u201cWhether (Biden) is a candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign sent out a stream of memos, fundraising appeals and statements over the weekend, insisting he would not quit. \u201cJoe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee, period. End of story,\u201d the campaign wrote to supporters in one email. \u201cVoters voted. He won overwhelmingly. And if he were to drop out, it would lead to weeks of chaos, internal food fighting, and a bunch of candidates who limp into a brutal floor fight at the convention, all while Donald Trump has time to speak to American voters uncontested.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s performance was so poor on Thursday night that he allowed Trump plenty of time to speak to voters uncontested, as the ex-president got away with a torrent of lies. Often, Biden missed chances to hammer Trump on key Democratic issues such as abortion, and turned the focus back to his own vulnerabilities, such as immigration. The ferocious counterattack by Biden\u2019s campaign, however, is not answering fundamental questions posed in the aftermath of a debate that shattered confidence in Biden\u2019s capacity to beat Trump for many of his fellow Democrats. The president was under extreme pressure heading into the showdown because polls have long shown majorities of voters believe he is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden has noticeably become more fragile in recent years and appears a much-changed figure even from when he took office in 2021. But instead of putting such fears to rest, he exacerbated them at a pivotal moment in the campaign with over 50 million viewers watching. And while Biden bounced back with a strong performance at a scripted campaign event in North Carolina on Friday, it will be impossible to erase the painful picture of a president falling prey to the ravages of time in his televised clash with Trump. Voters saw Biden\u2019s reduced and poignant state with their own eyes. New poll shows growing concern over Biden\u2019s age Biden\u2019s campaign has long denied that the president\u2019s age is disqualifying, even though it\u2019s one of the first issues voters raise outside of the Washington political bubble. Efforts to shield Biden from public scrutiny now risk coming across as an attempt to hide his true condition from the public. The debate has shattered the credibility of frequent attempts by those around Biden to argue that while he\u2019s often shaky in public, behind closed doors he is a dynamic force who runs intellectual rings around young aides. Biden campaign manager Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon even blamed any poor forthcoming polls on the media and not the president. \u201cIf we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,\u201d she wrote, referring to former President Barack Obama\u2019s numbers after he lost his first debate to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney in 2012. The comparison is inexact, however. Obama did perform very poorly and pitched his campaign into crisis. But there was never any question that he was not physically or mentally fit to serve another four years as president. A new CBS/YouGov poll\u00a0conducted after the debate found that 72% of registered voters now believe that Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. That\u2019s seven points higher than weeks before the debate. Only 28% of voters said Biden should be running for president. Some 46% of Democratic registered voters thought he should not be. On the one hand, these are devastating figures for a president who has seen erosion in key aspects of his coalition \u2014 among young, progressive and minority voters especially and has an increasingly narrow path through battleground states. But if there\u2019s one silver lining for Biden, it\u2019s that voters have long thought he\u2019s too old to run and he\u2019s been closely matched with Trump in national polls, raising the possibility that the twice impeached convicted felon alienates so many voters that the president may still be seen as a better choice by many. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty raised this point in a pep talk email to Biden supporters, noting that \u201cpeople were reminded of what they hate about Donald Trump: that he\u2019s unhinged, out for revenge, and in it for himself.\u201d Flaherty also took remarkable swipes at the \u201cbed wetting brigade\u201d of Democrats calling on Biden to drop out and suggested voters didn\u2019t care about cable news analysis or \u201cself-important Podcasters,\u201d an apparent reference to former Obama aides on the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast who were withering in their criticism.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_rudy-giuliani-officially-disbarred-in-new-york", "text": "The New York state Supreme Court on Tuesday disbarred former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani over his part in Donald Trump\u2019s election interference efforts in 2020. The long-expected disbarment of Trump\u2019s most high-profile lawyer, which is effective immediately, is a major blow to the former public official at a time he faces fallout for spreading lies about the 2020 election. In addition to losing his law license \u2013 which is likely to be recognized across the country \u2013 Giuliani is in bankruptcy after landing $150 million in debt for defaming two election workers, and faces several other lawsuits against him as well as criminal charges. \u201cThe seriousness of (Giuliani\u2019s) misconduct cannot be overstated,\u201d the court wrote. \u201c(Giuliani)\u00a0flagrantly misused his prominent position as the personal attorney for former President Trump and his campaign, through which (he) repeatedly and intentionally made false statements, some of which were perjurious, to the federal court, state lawmakers, the public, the (Attorney Grievance Committee), and this Court concerning the 2020 Presidential election, in which he baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country\u2019s electoral process.\u201d Giuliani, the court said, \u201cnot only deliberately violated some of the most fundamental tenets of the legal profession, but he also actively contributed to the national strife that has followed the 2020 Presidential election, for which he is entirely unrepentant.\u201d Giuliani previously was suspended from being able to practice law while the New York court considered attorney discipline proceedings against him. In its ruling, the court cited the former Trump attorney\u2019s efforts to overturn the election results in several 2020 battleground states. On X, Giuliani said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the ruling and blasted what he said was a corrupt system. A spokesman for Giuliani also condemned the disbarment, which had gone through several proceedings before the court\u2019s final decision on Tuesday. \u201cMembers of the legal community who respect the rule of law in this country should immediately come forward and speak out against this politically and ideologically corrupted decision. We will be appealing this objectively flawed decision in hopes that the appellate process will restore integrity into our system of justice,\u201d spokesman Ted Goodman said in a statement. Giuliani played a key role in several of Trump\u2019s schemes to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He was involved in alleged efforts to put forth fake electors to falsely certify Trump victories in several states, such as Arizona and Georgia, and, as the court noted Tuesday, Giuliani \u201cfalsely and dishonestly asserted to the public that people were brought from Camden, New Jersey, to vote illegally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the 2020 presidential election.\u201d In Georgia, Giuliani is charged with a RICO violation as well as several additional felonies, including soliciting Georgia state lawmakers, making false statements to the Georgia House and Senate and working to put forward fake electors in the state. He is one of several co-conspirators indicted in that case, in which Trump also is a defendant. He is facing charges related to the election subversion efforts in Arizona and is an unindicted co-conspirator\u00a0in Trump\u2019s federal election subversion case. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_house-democrats-chaos-within-caucus-biden-concerns", "text": "Three House Democratic lawmakers say they have been besieged with hundreds of texts, phones ringing off the hook and numerous video calls as the party looks to blunt the fallout from President Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance last week and determine what\u2019s next ahead of November. The lawmakers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, painted a feverish mood within the House Democratic Caucus as Biden has privately acknowledged\u00a0that the\u00a0next\u00a0stretch of days is crucial to his campaign as he faces a growing number of calls to\u00a0step aside as the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee or risk the party\u2019s chances of keeping the White House and winning back control of the House. \u201cThe phones don\u2019t stop ringing. Everyone is talking,\u201d one House Democrat told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead,\u201d pointing to polling that shows the president\u2019s waning popularity and the\u00a0prevailing fear that Biden remaining at the top of the ticket\u00a0could negatively affect House races. \u201cPolling of House members is cratering. We all are out-performing the president, but that\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d the member said. Another House Democrat said one of Biden\u2019s answers during the debate \u2013 which ultimately ended in\u00a0confused silence\u00a0\u2013 made them \u201cget up and leave.\u201d \u201cMy blood pressure went through the roof. I went into the other room and had a glass of wine. The president\u2019s performance was so bad so early, it was the first time I thought I could lose my race as well,\u201d the second House Democrat said. A third House Democrat said they had believed the Biden campaign and the White House when they publicly lauded the president as healthy \u2014 until they watched the debate. \u201cI thought he was older.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_biden-netanyahu-meeting-washington-israel-gaza", "text": "President Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to meet in Washington, DC, in several weeks when the Israeli prime minister visits to address Congress on July 24, a source familiar told CNN. US and Israeli officials are still in the process of nailing down logistical details for the Biden-Netanyahu meeting, which would likely take place at the White House, the source said. The two leaders will see each other, barring any abrupt last-minute change in circumstances. A White House official told CNN that Biden has known Netanyahu for decades, and that \u201cthey will likely see each other when the Prime Minister is here over the course of that week.\u00a0But we have nothing to announce at this time.\u201d CNN has also reached out to the prime minister\u2019s office for comment. The meeting this month would come as a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israel-Hamas war remains stalled, and as tensions between Biden and Netanyahu have escalated in recent months as the US has grown increasingly frustrated\u00a0with the way Israel has executed the war, including the lack of protections for civilians. Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0last week\u00a0he was still \u201ccommitted\u201d\u00a0to an Israeli ceasefire and hostage release proposal\u00a0outlined by Biden in May, which sets out conditions intended to lead to\u00a0the release\u00a0of all remaining\u00a0hostages, a\u00a0permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The prime minister had faced backlash after\u00a0initially\u00a0saying he would accept \u201ca partial deal.\u201d Biden and Netanyahu have spoken by phone regularly since\u00a0Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks, and they last met in person when the president flew to Tel Aviv in the days immediately following the brutal assault.\u00a0The president has grown increasingly willing to publicly share his impatience and criticism. Last month, Biden said in an interview that Netanyahu may be dragging out the war in an attempt to cling to power and said it was \u201cuncertain\u201d whether Israel had\u00a0committed war crimes. More recently, Netanyahu prompted intense frustration in Washington when he publicly claimed the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons\u201d in a video posted to X claiming that Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cassured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks.\u201d CNN reported that\u00a0US envoy Amos Hochstein told Netanyahu\u00a0in response that the prime minister\u2019s comments were \u201cunproductive\u201d and \u201cmore importantly, completely untrue,\u201d and that\u00a0American officials went through a line-by-line explanation\u00a0of hundreds of US weapons shipments to Israel\u00a0with the country\u2019s defense minister\u00a0in a bid to rebut Netanyahu\u2019s claims.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters", "text": "With its immunity ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s wish of all but guaranteeing that his criminal trial for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election will not go to trial before the 2024 election in November. It also granted presidents in general a definitive \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution for core official acts and said presidents should be presumed immune for a much more expansive list of acts. In the view of the majority comprised of the six conservative justices on the court, the decision does not place presidents in general, and Trump in particular, above the law. But the three liberals dissented with a warning about how elevating a president will affect American democracy. The decision has the near-term result of delaying Trump\u2019s trial while a court in Washington, DC, considers which criminal activity that Trump is accused of can be considered \u201cunofficial.\u201d It also has the long-term effect of placing presidents in a different system of justice than other Americans. Here are key lines from a landmark ruling: What is this new immunity? Chief Justice John Roberts explains it in the majority opinion as including absolute immunity for some actions and a presumption of immunity for others. Why does a president need this immunity? So that he can act boldly as president and take actions without fear of later prosecution clouding his judgement, according to the court. Here\u2019s Roberts: What does it say in the Constitution about presidents getting special immunity? Nothing. But that\u2019s no problem, according to Roberts. How far does this immunity extend? A president gets \u201cat least a presumptive immunity\u201d even for acts \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,\u201d according to the court. But it\u2019s careful to add that he gets no immunity for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2013 and despite the broad reach of the immunity, the court argues presidents are still accountable. Are any of the things Trump is accused of in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment outside this blanket of immunity? During oral arguments in the case back in April, Trump\u2019s attorney, John Sauer, told Justice Amy Coney Barrett that multiple elements of the indictment would indeed be \u201cprivate,\u201d or unofficial, acts. These include, for instance, getting an outside attorney to organize slates of false electors. Barrett, in a concurring opinion on Monday, said she would make clear in the decision what was official versus unofficial. But the majority takes no position and wants the trial court to go through the allegations individually. Trump can then appeal whatever the trial court decides. Here\u2019s Roberts: Does the majority tell the trial court what might be official or not? The majority gives quite a bit of detail. Trump has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for any instructions or pressure he exerted on his acting attorney general, for instance. Plus, the court won\u2019t allow as evidence any interviews with people who worked in the administration (nullifying much of the evidence gathered by the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, events). And it also won\u2019t let a court consider a president\u2019s motives for taking an action. It\u2019s an open question for the lower court to decide if Trump\u2019s pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to disregard the 2020 election results involved \u201cofficial conduct,\u201d but the Supreme Court put that pressure in the \u201cpresumptively immune\u201d category. The majority thinks Trump\u2019s tweets encouraging people to go to the Capitol and pressure Pence are within the \u201couter perimeter of his official responsibilities,\u201d but they\u2019re not sure and they expect it will be challenging for the lower court to muddle through these questions. Why can\u2019t a jury make these decisions? Juries can\u2019t even consider official acts in terms of a prosecution, according to the Supreme Court. So the Supreme Court gave Trump everything he wanted? It certainly embraced Trump\u2019s theory of immunity and pretty much guaranteed the trial will not happen before the election, although the majority says they were restrained since they rejected his request to completely dismiss the case. So there is a special system of justice for presidents? The president is more than a person, according to Roberts. The majority dismisses warnings about a president operating above the laws as \u201cfear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals.\u201d It\u2019s more important to protect the president from political prosecutions, the court says. Roberts borrows from Trump\u2019s attorneys when he quotes George Washington\u2019s farewell address, in which he warns about factions. The problem with that particular quote, as I found earlier this year, is that Washington also warned about elevating a person above the law. Does the court mention the politics of today? Roberts says the court\u2019s considerations are more far-reaching than what\u2019s happening at the moment. Did it say anything about Smith? The majority did not weigh in on the brewing argument among conservatives that Smith should not even have a job and that his role as a special counsel is unconstitutional. But Justice Clarence Thomas endorsed the idea in a concurring opinion. What did Barrett say about alternate electors? Barrett, a Trump appointee, wrote her own concurrence in which she disagreed with the majority on some key points. She said they could easily have expressed that some of Trump\u2019s conduct was unofficial. What was in the blistering dissent? Writing for the three liberals on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the majority as inventing an \u201catextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.\u201d She said the court makes it difficult to imagine what might be \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct on the part of the president. The majority \u201cpays lip service\u201d to the idea that presidents are not above the law \u201cbut it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.\u201d How far does Sotomayor say presidents can now go? As far as they want, she says. Sotomayor ends her missive like this:", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_how-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling-can-help-donald-trump-fight-criminal-charges", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team is expected to use Monday\u2019s historic Supreme Court decision granting him partial presidential immunity to attack the evidence against him in all four of his criminal cases, according to multiple sources familiar with their strategy. The legal team hailed the 6-3 decision penned by Chief Justice John Roberts as a \u201cmajor victory,\u201d arguing it provides new avenues for Trump to defend himself in the two pending federal cases against him, as well as his state prosecution in Georgia, and challenge his conviction on 34 state felony charges in New York. The historic ruling from the high court said that Trump enjoys \u201cabsolute\u201d presidential immunity for \u201chis core constitutional powers,\u201d but that he \u201cenjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does if official.\u201d While a lot of attention has been focused on how the opinion bars prosecution for certain acts, the Trump legal team sees their biggest advantage in the court\u2019s prohibition against using official acts as evidence. The majority ruled that evidence about official acts cannot be introduced \u201ceven on charges that purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct.\u201d The Trump team is hopeful that language can be used to undermine the charges that survive the court\u2019s immunity parameters. Mar-a-Lago classified documents case Trump\u2019s lawyers believe the court\u2019s ruling could have the biggest impact on the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, according to a source. In Florida, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury on over 30 felony counts of unlawfully retaining national defense information and obstruction for allegedly attempting to interfere with the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. His lawyers plan to argue that the Supreme Court opinion requires the district court to exclude evidence related to Trump\u2019s time in office and how the classified documents came into his possession and allegedly ended up at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, his Mar-a-Lago estate and at least one storage space. They will argue these are officials acts that would be shielded by the presidential immunity outlined in Roberts\u2019 opinion, according to a source familiar with the strategy. Jessica Levinson, a professor of Constitutional law at Loyola Law School, called the strategy \u201csuper creative,\u201d but said there are flaws in the argument. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them, of course they should make that type of argument,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cI think it has problems, in the sense that Roberts didn\u2019t say absolutely everything you do while in office is an official act.\u201d Levinson said that the initial question is when it comes to taking classified documents out of the Oval Office, the argument is whether a person has constitutional or statutory authority to do so. \u201cIt seems to me to stretch the opinion beyond its breaking point,\u201d she said. The federal judge overseeing that case, Aileen Cannon, has yet to hear arguments over whether the case can be tossed on presidential immunity. Cannon, who has taken months to decide a number of pre-trial disputes, has also yet to set a trial date in the case. Challenging the New York hush money conviction Trump\u2019s lawyers have already signaled that they will use the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Trump v. US to try to overturn his conviction in New York on 34 felony counts related to a hush money payment scheme he helped facilitate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. On Tuesday, Judge Juan Merchan delayed Trump\u2019s July 11 sentencing date until September to brief the court on how they believe the court\u2019s decision applies to the New York case. Trump\u2019s legal team is expected to use the opinion to challenge specific evidence used at trial that could fall under \u201cofficial acts,\u201d including portions of former White House aide Hope Hicks\u2019 testimony and tweets from when Trump was in office, according to a source familiar with their thinking. \u201cEven though you\u2019re the president and you speak to somebody employed by the White House, not every conversation you have is an official act,\u201d Levinson said. Back in April, the Trump team petitioned to delay the trial until after the Supreme Court ruled on Trump\u2019s immunity claims.\u00a0Merchan denied that request but the ruling appears to change the calculus. Trump\u2019s team had previously said they would challenge his conviction on appeal, and the new opinion has already provided a reprieve to the former president in that matter. Federal election subversion case A source familiar with the Trump team\u2019s legal strategy tells CNN they are confident that Monday\u2019s opinion will result in the entire 2020 election subversion case brought by special counsel Jack Smith getting tossed out. But the Supreme Court deferred to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the case, to determine which allegations in Smith\u2019s indictment would be barred under the decision and the opinion said that additional briefing will be needed for the trial court to do so. The high court\u2019s decision could undercut the part of the indictment related to Trump\u2019s pressure on Justice Department officials, especially Jeffrey Clark, to help him after the election. That kind of direction to his subordinates in the executive branch would be immune from prosecution and cannot be part of the prosecutors\u2019 case going forward. Proceedings in that case are not expected to resume until early August. Trump\u2019s team will use the court\u2019s opinion to fight evidence in the case like meetings he had with his top advisers and Vice President Mike Pence in an effort to undermine Smith\u2019s ability to prove the charges that are still standing after Chutkan completes her analysis. Levinson said that Trump\u2019s team is on a lot \u201cstronger\u201d ground here in this argument. \u201cI read the majority as putting their thumb on the scale so that a lot of those communications look like official acts, and so there is at least the presumption of immunity,\u201d Levinson said. Though the ruling technically allows Smith\u2019s prosecution to move forward, what it tasks Chutkan with doing makes it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. Georgia Election Subversion Case The high court\u2019s ruling could also affect the state-level election subversion charges Trump is facing in Fulton County, Georgia. The Georgia case has been on pause and is in legal limbo as an appeals court in the state considers an effort by Trump and several other co-defendants to disqualify District Attorney Fani Willis, who brought the case, over concerns about alleged ethical lapses. Trump\u2019s lead attorney in his Georgia case, Steve Sadow, argued in January that the charges should be dismissed under presidential immunity. If Willis is ultimately permitted to remain on the case, proceedings at the trial-level court would be allowed to resume \u2013 meaning Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee would have to go through the same analysis on presidential\u00a0immunity\u00a0that the US Supreme Court is requiring in the federal election subversion case. Prosecutors had been waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in before responding to Sadow\u2019s motion. Defense attorneys in the\u00a0Georgia\u00a0case say any decision from McAfee on presidential immunity\u00a0would be subject to appeal, potentially all the way back up to the US Supreme Court. Other issues, like the Supremacy Clause, could also come into play on appeal. A source familiar with the Trump team strategy said that if the Georgia case goes forward, it likely would happen after the other cases have already been litigated and the team would have a roadmap for how judges have applied the Supreme Court opinion will apply to this case. \u201cThe Georgia case is in a lot of ways a state analog to the federal case, but the question of whether or not\u00a0Trump has immunity is a federal constitutional question,\u201d Levinson said. CNN\u2019s Zach Cohen, Devan Cole and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/how-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling-can-help-donald-trump-fight-criminal-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_rubio-vance-trump-vice-president", "text": "The two Republican senators on Donald Trump\u2019s shortlist for potential running mates may have to overcome some political baggage in the form of their home-state\u00a0governors to get the nod. If Trump\u00a0picks either Marco Rubio of Florida or JD Vance of Ohio, the senator\u2019s\u00a0successor would be chosen by a Republican governor who has engaged in high-profile\u00a0clashes with the former president. In Florida, that honor would go to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a onetime\u00a0ally viewed more recently by Trump as \u201cdisloyal\u201d for launching a rival presidential campaign. If Vance is picked, his Ohio replacement would be appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine, who has rarely seen eye to eye\u00a0with the former president. It\u2019s a fact that allies of Vance and Rubio are acutely aware of in the intensifying final days leading up to Trump\u2019s announcement \u2013 and one they are trying to mitigate against by insisting the other senator has it worse. Pro-Rubio forces have suggested to those who will listen that\u00a0DeWine would likely replace Vance with someone unaligned with Trump\u2019s MAGA movement. \u201cIt would be a step backwards for the America First agenda,\u201d one such Rubio backer said in making the case against Vance. Meanwhile, DeSantis\u2019 deflection from Trump is a regular topic of conversation among those rooting for a running mate other than Rubio, including people urging the former president to consider Vance. A person with knowledge of the Trump-DeSantis relationship said the narrative may have captured the former president\u2019s attention several months ago, but their ties have improved since their acrimonious race ended. In April, Trump and DeSantis met face-to-face and spoke for the first time since DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race some three months earlier. \u201cThey get along way better,\u201d the person said. Usually, when presidential candidates are considering a senator\u00a0as a running mate, concern about a replacement only arises\u00a0if a governor from the opposing party is in charge of the appointment, especially in a closely divided chamber. That isn\u2019t the case here as Republicans would not be at risk of losing the seat. Another running mate contender, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, would also create an opening if selected for the role, but unlike Rubio and Vance, his home-state governor, Henry McMaster, is a Trump-aligned conservative. Scott, though, as CNN previously reported, is outside Trump\u2019s current top three of Vance, Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Trump is weighing a host of factors in his running mate search\u00a0that reach far beyond the potential political dominos that may fall in Ohio or\u00a0Florida. His team has repeatedly said that\u00a0Trump is focused on finding someone who will \u201cmake a great president\u00a0for eight years after his next four-year term concludes.\u201d Meanwhile, the camps for the competing senators insist they\u2019re not directly engaging in the shadow campaigns, with one Ohio Republican operative describing Vance and Rubio as \u201cfriends.\u201d Still, every consideration has been explored as Trump inches toward a decision \u2013 which could come anytime between now and the Republican National Convention later this month. Also, Trump is known to hold grudges and it\u2019s hard to find two Republican governors who have landed on the former president\u2019s bad side more than DeWine and DeSantis. Eye on the Buckeye State DeWine has not explicitly endorsed Trump\u2019s third White House bid and recently found himself on opposite sides of the former president in a key Republican Senate primary in the Buckeye State. Trump backed the eventual winner, businessman Bernie Moreno, while DeWine put his name behind state Sen. Matt Dolan. Though DeWine\u00a0is a former US senator himself, his allies believe it is incredibly unlikely he would appoint himself to the job if Vance is chosen. Though he has never been close to Trump, DeWine\u00a0also wouldn\u2019t want a bad relationship with a Republican administration, they say. \u201cI don\u2019t think Mike DeWine would make a decision based on what Trump would like or hate,\u201d said Ohio Republican strategist Mark Weaver, who has advised DeWine in the past. \u201cI think he does what he thinks is best for Ohio. He does not get caught up in the Trump clamor, much to the chagrin of those caught up in the Trump clamor.\u201d For DeWine, the choice of successor is a potentially legacy-defining pick,\u00a0and finding someone who could appease all party factions, from the establishment class to the MAGA wing, and\u00a0survive a primary challenge in 2026 would be a top priority, Republicans close to the governor told CNN. Among those in the mix are Dolan, former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Attorney General Dave Yost. The Ohio GOP operative added that DeWine, who cannot run for a third term in 2026,\u00a0is already jockeying for Lt. Gov.\u00a0Jon Husted to succeed him and is cognizant that angering Trump now could create problems for that race down the line. Another Ohio Republican familiar with DeWine\u2019s operation noted that the governor has often elevated women into critical roles and would likely consider the opportunity to appoint the state\u2019s first female senator. Trump-DeSantis relationship in the spotlight Trump and DeSantis have not discussed potential contenders to fill Rubio\u2019s seat, according to two people close to the governor\u2019s political team. Nor do they believe DeSantis would consider Trump\u2019s wishes when making a decision. \u201cThere are no deals,\u00a0and he\u2019s not going to trade a Senate seat to help Marco,\u201d a fundraiser close to DeSantis\u2019 political operation said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he cares about getting back on Trump\u2019s good side\u00a0that way.\u201d The person with knowledge of the Trump-DeSantis relationship also confirmed that no such discussions have taken place, though the person added that the former president would be reticent to broach the topic until after he has selected a running mate. Trump is keeping the selection under wraps,\u00a0and some of his closest aides are unaware which direction he is headed. If Rubio is Trump\u2019s choice, DeSantis could face a decision on replacing his fellow Florida Republican sooner rather than later. To help avoid constitutional hurdles from sharing a home state with Trump, Rubio could resign his seat and establish residence elsewhere. In an interview on CNN after last week\u2019s debate, Rubio said it would be \u201cpresumptuous\u201d to discuss such a scenario. \u201cThe job has not been offered to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not the vice presidential choice. No one is right now. And we\u2019ll cross bridges when we get to them.\u201d Several people close to DeSantis\u2019 political team believe his chief of staff,\u00a0James Uthmeier,\u00a0is at or near the top of the list of people he would consider to succeed Rubio. Uthmeier, widely considered the Florida governor\u2019s most trusted aide, also took over DeSantis\u2019 embattled presidential campaign down the stretch. As campaign manager, he oversaw DeSantis pivot to a far more aggressive posture against Trump as he tried to gain traction with Republican voters. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a factor,\u201d the person apprised of the Trump-DeSantis relationship said. \u201c And I do think DeSantis would check in with Trump before making a pick.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alayna Treene and Kit Maher contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/rubio-vance-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_bob-menendez-defense-corruption-trial", "text": "Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s defense team\u00a0rested\u00a0its case Wednesday without calling the New Jersey Democrat to the stand in his federal corruption trial. Menendez\u2019s lawyers called five witnesses over two days of testimony, including his sister, sister-in-law and the attorney for a friend of Jose Uribe, the New Jersey businessman who allegedly bribed the senator in exchange for legal favors and pleaded guilty before the trial began. The legal team for co-defendant Fred Daibes also rested Wednesday without presenting a defense. Lawyers for Menendez\u2019s other co-defendant, Wael Hana, called a witness Wednesday and indicated that their next and last witness will be called Monday \u2013 if that witness is able to fly in \u2013 when the trial resumes after the July 4 holiday. Federal prosecutors said they will decide in the next days if they are presenting a rebuttal case. Closing arguments are also expected to begin Monday. The prosecution rested its case\u00a0Friday\u00a0after seven weeks of testimony from\u00a0at least 30 witnesses. Over that time period, federal prosecutors attempted to untangle the\u00a0multiple corruption schemes\u00a0that they say resulted in the senator and his wife, Nadine Menendez, garnishing\u00a0gold bars, nearly half a million dollars in cash, a\u00a0Mercedes-Benz\u00a0and thousands of dollars in mortgage payments. Nadine Menendez\u00a0is also charged with participating\u00a0in\u00a0the bribery scheme but will be tried separately later this summer. She has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the senator\u2019s sister, Caridad Gonzalez,\u00a0testified that her family\u2019s cash storing practices were \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 FBI agents recovered nearly half a million dollars in cash from Bob and Nadine Menendez\u2019s\u00a0residence during a\u00a0raid in June 2022.\u00a0Defense attorneys have argued that the senator stored the cash at his home because of familial trauma caused by the Cuban communist regime. (Menendez was born in New York City, and Fidel Castro had not yet come to power at the time the Menendez family left Cuba.) \u201cIt\u2019s a Cuban thing,\u201d Gonzalez, 80, said on the stand. \u201cEvery Cuban who came to the States in the early 50s, 60s, 70s\u201d stored cash in their home and in boxes because \u201cthey were afraid of losing what they worked so hard for because in Cuba they took everything away from you.\u201d Gonzalez also said she didn\u2019t know\u00a0if her brother had stored any money\u00a0in his home. Lawyers for the senator also called his wife\u2019s sister, Katia Tabourian, to testify about her Lebanese family and their practices of commonly gifting gold and keeping jewelry, gold coins, gold bars and cash. Prosecutors have alleged throughout the case that Nadine Menendez accepted cash, gold bars and other bribes such as an exercise machine, in exchange for offering her husband\u2019s power and influence to the co-conspirators. Tabourian testified that her sister got their grandmother\u2019s gold bars as a gift because she was the favorite out of five grandchildren. Tabourian said that it was very common to have gold coins and bars at home, noting that \u201ceverybody had a safe\u201d in Lebanon. A forensic accountant, Russell\u00a0Richardson, testified\u00a0for the defense about his review of Menendez\u2019s financial records to show that the senator had a general pattern of withdrawing cash. Richardson conceded under cross-examination, however,\u00a0that were Menendez given cash, it wouldn\u2019t show up on a bank statement unless he deposited it. Michael Critchley, the attorney for Elvis Parra, a friend of Uribe\u2019s, testified that Menendez called him in March 2019 and that they had a roughly two-minute conversation about Parra\u2019s case. \u201cI got the impression, the understanding, that he felt the same way that I did about the prosecution of Elvis Parra, that it was an abuse of prosecution,\u201d Critchley said. He said he didn\u2019t recall Menendez asking him to take any specific action, and he did not believe anything to be improper.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/bob-menendez-defense-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s spotty debate performance immediately triggered new questions from worried Democrats about whether he would leave the presidential race. It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party\u2019s delegates means it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be forced out of the race against his will. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the \u201960s. Voters choose the nominee. He is the nominee,\u201d said CNN analyst and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, reacting to Biden\u2019s performance at the debate Thursday night on CNN. That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination. Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats\u2019 convention will return to Chicago in August. As we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February,\u00a0if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates \u2013\u00a0almost all of them currently pledged to Biden \u2013 allocated as part of the primary process. These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could\u00a0decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president\u2019s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against former President Donald Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party\u2019s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats \u2013\u00a0The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans \u2013\u00a0If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party\u2019s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party\u2019s nominee. Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate\u2019s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen.\u00a0Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.) The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_white-house-biden-mental-fitness", "text": "The White House on Tuesday fended off tough questions about President Joe Biden\u2019s mental fitness, acknowledging his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate while maintaining the president is still able to hold and run for office. \u201cFirst of all, I want to say, we understand the concerns. We get it. The president did not have a great night,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. She later added: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking away from what the American people saw.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s press briefing, the first since the debate, came as Biden has faced one of the toughest stretches of his presidency and with his reelection campaign reeling. Campaign officials are scrambling to calm donors who were shocked by Biden\u2019s halting, hoarse performance. The White House announced Tuesday\u00a0that Biden\u00a0is expected to\u00a0meet with Democratic governors and congressional leaders Wednesday after\u00a0some\u00a0demanded a meeting with the president. Some officials have been turned off by the Biden campaign\u2019s dismissiveness over their concerns about the president\u2019s health. And earlier Tuesday, a Democratic member of Congress became the first to ask Biden to drop out of the race. The White House preempted the first questions from reporters by announcing Biden will appear in two high-profile events over the next week: an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that will air in part on Friday and a solo news conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week. Such unscripted events are rare for the president, who by CNN\u2019s count lags behind his most recent predecessors in formal press conferences. Thursday\u2019s debate was the biggest audience Biden has had since his last round of debates against former President Donald Trump four years ago \u2013 exacerbating the shock some felt at his performance. Asked whether Biden regularly presents himself the way he did at the debate, Jean-Pierre evoked a speech that Biden gave in North Carolina the day after the debate: \u201cHe understands that he\u2019s not a young man,\u201d she said, adding that his focus is going to be on continuing \u201cto deliver for the American people on the issues that they care about.\u201d In a deeply reported piece published Tuesday, The New York Times reported that people in the room with Biden have become increasingly concerned with how he has recently presented himself, describing the president as seeming confused at some points during two high-profile trips to Europe in recent weeks. Biden has increasingly indicated he is aware of the problems with his debate performance as the fallout within his own party has mounted. The president said during a fundraiser Tuesday that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d during CNN\u2019s presidential debate last week and blamed his poor performance on his grueling travel schedule, according to pool reports. \u201cI decided to travel around the world a couple of times \u2026 shortly before the debate \u2026 I didn\u2019t listen to my staff \u2026 and then I almost fell asleep onstage,\u201d Biden said during the fundraiser in Virginia on Tuesday evening. The remark was met with brief laughter from those in attendance, according to a recording of the president\u2019s remarks. Multiple reporters who were in the room said that they believed the \u201cfell asleep\u201d line appeared intended to be a joke and that Biden was trying to make light of the situation in a self-deprecating way, but it did not land, in their view. Biden had nearly two weeks between his return on June 15 from Italy for the G7 meeting and the debate on June 27, according to a CNN review of his schedule. Jean-Pierre reiterated during the press briefing that Biden had been sick during the debate last week \u2013 adding that he still had a cold. The president did not take any cold medication prior to the debate, she said. \u201cI would not see this as an episode,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cI would see this as what it was and what we believe it to be \u2013 which is, it was a bad night.\u201d She added the administration is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d hiding information about the president\u2019s health or ability to do his job. Jean-Pierre also addressed recent reporting that Hunter Biden had been joining his father in recent White House meetings. NBC was the\u00a0first to report\u00a0on Hunter Biden\u2019s participation in the meetings. Jean-Pierre said the president\u2019s son, who was convicted last month on three felony gun charges,\u00a0returned to the White House with his father after spending the weekend at Camp David and \u201cwalked with him into\u201d a meeting to prepare for Biden\u2019s Monday night speech on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump\u2019s immunity case. \u201cAnd he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cThey were together at Camp David. They came back together.\u201d Jean-Pierre also declined to engage with a question from CNN\u2019s MJ Lee on a CNN poll conducted following last week\u2019s debate showing Vice President Kamala Harris outpacing Biden in a hypothetical race against Trump. The poll shows Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47% of registered voters support Trump and 45% Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario. Jean-Pierre offered a confusing response referring the inquiry to the president\u2019s reelection campaign. \u201cWhat I can speak to, is the president\u2019s record. What I can speak to what he\u2019s been able to accomplish,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the things that he\u2019s been able to do and get done \u2026 is actually in line with majority of Americans. And I think that\u2019s important to note, and again, I will say with age comes wisdom and experience. And that certainly it\u2019s something that the president brings.\u201d Harris batted down the idea of running in Biden\u2019s place during a brief interview with CBS Tuesday afternoon: \u201cLook, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The family\u2019s all in.\u201d First lady Jill Biden, the president\u2019s closest confidant, was on the road in the battleground state of Michigan ahead of a Wednesday evening return. In Washington, meanwhile, the White House publicly maintained the president is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d considering stepping down, even as\u00a0Biden has privately acknowledged\u00a0the\u00a0next\u00a0stretch of days is crucial to his campaign. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of talk out there, let me repeat what my husband has said plainly and clearly: Joe\u00a0is\u00a0the Democratic nominee and he\u00a0is\u00a0going to beat Donald Trump, just like he did in 2020,\u201d Jill Biden said at the opening of a campaign office in Traverse City, Michigan, according to a pool report. \u201cAre you ready to help me?\u201d \u201cJoe has been knocked down and counted out his whole life, but when he gets knocked down, he gets back up. When he gets counted out, he works harder. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, but he needs your help,\u201d she added. The first lady attended two official White House events in Middleville, Michigan, to highlight summer nutrition programs and a Hidden Helpers summer camp for children from military families, as well as the campaign office opening with Chasten Buttigieg, the husband of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. As the president faced a growing number of calls Wednesday to\u00a0step aside as the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, a former Biden aide said the president and the first lady would not make any significant decision without consulting the other. \u201cThey don\u2019t make significant decisions in any part of their lives without consulting the other. She is a trustworthy sounding board for him, he always wants to know what she thinks, what her opinion is,\u201d the aide said. The White House pushed back Wednesday evening on criticism around the first lady\u2019s role and responsibility as her husband tries to salvage his candidacy. \u201cThe President has plenty of political and policy advisors \u2013 that\u2019s never been her role,\u201d Elizabeth Alexander, deputy assistant to the president and communications director to the first lady, told CNN. \u201cAs much as any husband and wife team make decisions together that impact their lives, they absolutely do, but as she\u2019s said more times than I can count \u2013 politics is his lane. She supports his career and he supports hers.\u201d Alexander lamented the \u201cinherent tension\u201d that previous first ladies have endured that she believes is being amplified in this moment for Jill Biden. \u201cYou are supportive, but can\u2019t be so supportive that your motives are questioned,\u201d she said. \u201cSociety has put all first ladies, including Dr. Biden, in an impossible situation \u2013 with Twitter/X magnifying this on steroids in today\u2019s world.\u201d Asked whether Jill Biden is hiding a medical condition of her husband, she replied \u201cNo. An emphatic no.\u201d An ally of the president and first lady separately told CNN that all of the calls for Jill Biden to step up at this moment are ludicrous. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to put the future of the Democratic Party on a spouse; she\u2019s not elected, not a professional political advisor; she\u2019s not a pollster, or a campaign manager,\u201d the source said. Biden, according to the source, will continue to be his biggest defender, saying: \u201cCall it being a Mama Bear or Philly Girl \u2013 she\u2019s tough, and of course defends her family.\u00a0Always will.\u201d A second former Biden aide said any decision on the president\u2019s future would not be made by the first lady alone, but rather the very small inner circle of family members \u2013 namely, this source said: Ashley Biden, Hunter Biden and Valerie Biden. Members of the Biden family are expected to be on hand for Fourth of July festivities at the White House. The president and the first lady are expected to speak together at an event in Philadelphia on Sunday and will spend the rest of the weekend at their home in Wilmington, Delaware. It is possible other family will join the couple in Delaware as well. The president huddled with his children and grandchildren at Camp David earlier this week, a long planned gathering to partake in a family photo shoot but one where the state of his presidential campaign arose. The family encouraged the president to stay in the race in the days after his halting debate performance, sources told CNN. After spending two days at Camp David, the president and first lady returned to the White House with Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau. Hunter Biden accompanied his father as he met with staff to prepare for his speech on the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity ruling. \u201cHunter\u00a0came back with him and walked with him into that meeting, that prep, that speech prep. And you know, and he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. \u201cThey were together at Camp David. They came back together.\u201d The president\u2019s son, who was recently found guilty on three felony gun charges, also attended a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/biden-family-first-lady-2024-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Attorney General Andrew\u00a0Bailey, a Republican, is asking to stay Trump\u2019s impending sentence\u00a0and the gag order still in place against Trump until after the presidential election in November. The motion argues that the gag order and impending sentencing against Trump \u201cinterfere with his ability to freely travel and campaign and interfere with the right of Americans everywhere \u2013 and members of the Electoral College in particular \u2013 to hear Trump\u2019s political speech.\u201d \u201cThe American people ought to be able to participate in a presidential election free from New York\u2019s interference.

A Manhattan jury convicted Trump in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump\u2019s lawyers have already asked Judge Juan Merchan to set aside the conviction in the wake of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision on presidential immunity. Trump was set to be sentenced next week but Merchan has delayed the sentencing until at least September. A limited gag order barring Trump from publicly speaking about prosecutors, court staff and their families remains in place at least until Trump is sentenced. Last month Merchan amended the gag order to allow Trump to talk publicly about trial witnesses and the jury but left the other restrictions in place. The high court will decide how to proceed. One option is to set a briefing schedule in coming days on Missouri\u2019s immediate request \u2013 to temporarily block the gag order and sentencing, if it chooses.

Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_biden-campaign-ad-scotus-immunity", "text": "The Biden campaign is releasing a new television ad in battleground states seizing on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on presidential immunity, leveling pointed criticism toward the nation\u2019s highest court and former President Donald Trump. \u201cNearly 250 years ago, America was founded in defiance of a king, under the belief that no one is above the law, not even the president. Until now,\u201d the narrator says as video of Trump flashes across the screen. The 30-second TV spot then features an image of the six conservative Supreme Court justices as the narrator says, \u201cThe same Trump Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade ruled that the president can ignore the law even to commit a crime because Donald Trump asked them to.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s already led an insurrection and threatened to be a dictator on day one,\u201d the narrator continues. \u201cDonald Trump can never hold this office again.\u201d The ad, titled \u201c250 Years,\u201d is set to run in battleground states and will be part of a seven-figure buy, according to a campaign official who declined to provide an exact dollar amount. It will run on networks that \u201cover-index\u201d for younger and diverse audiences, including ESPN,\u00a0TNT, Bravo, FX, Freeform, and Comedy Central, the official said. The spot will also air during sporting events and other \u201clarge-viewership moments like national news programs.\u201d The push comes as President Joe Biden seeks to refocus his campaign on one of the central arguments of his reelection bid \u2013 protecting and preserving democracy \u2013 as he grapples with the fallout from his halting debate performance that has led many in the Democratic party to question whether he should remain at the top of the Democratic ticket. At least one member of Congress \u2013 Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas - has publicly called on Biden to step aside, and privately, a growing number of Democratic leaders say they want him to do so for the good of the party and the country. The president is expected to meet with Democratic governors and speak with congressional leaders Wednesday amid concerns about his debate performance. In his first remarks at the White House after the debate, the president condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity ruling and urged the American people to \u201cdissent\u201d in November. \u201cFor all practical purposes, there are virtually no limits on what the president can do,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamentally new principle and it\u2019s a dangerous precedent because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law even including the supreme court of the United States.\u201d Biden has become increasingly critical of the Supreme Court in recent months and has sought to warn that a Trump presidency could lead to the appointment of more conservative justices to the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cThe thing about America is that we were founded in defiance of a king, but this week, Trump\u2019s Supreme Court gave him carte blanche to do anything he wants if he ever walks back into the Oval Office,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said of the new ad. \u201cEverything he\u2019s pledged so far on the campaign trail \u2013 \u2018terminating\u2019 the Constitution, imprisoning his political opponents, and yes, ruling as a dictator if he gets the chance \u2013 are up for grabs because of this decision.

{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_joe-biden-2024-campaign-troubles", "text": "President Joe Biden has privately acknowledged that the next stretch of days are critical to whether he can save his reelection bid for president, making clear to an ally Tuesday that he understands what would prompt him to accept: \u201cIt\u2019s just not working.\u201d \u201cHe sees the moment. He\u2019s clear-eyed,\u201d this person told CNN. There is no ambiguity for the president\u00a0about\u00a0what\u00a0potential\u00a0series of events in the coming weeks would ultimately prompt him to acknowledge that his attempt to make amends\u00a0for last week\u2019s\u00a0disastrous debate on CNN aren\u2019t working, according to this ally. It would be a scenario in which \u201cthe polls are plummeting, the fundraising is drying up, and the interviews are going badly,\u201d\u00a0they\u00a0said. \u201cHe\u2019s not oblivious.\u201d In response to a request for comment, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said that \u201cit is false to suggest there is any openness to ending the campaign.\u201d In the days since Biden\u2019s stunningly halting debate showing, Democrats across the country have expressed grave concern. Some elected officials have even begun to publicly call on Biden to drop out for the good of the party. The New York Times reported separately on Wednesday that Biden acknowledged that he may not be able to save his campaign if he does not perform well in public events over the next several days. The White House and Biden\u2019s campaign have denied that reporting. In Tuesday\u2019s private conversation, Biden was also \u201cchastened\u201d as he \u201cblamed himself\u201d \u2013 not his staff \u2013 for the\u00a0debate performance. \u201cHe said: \u2018I have done way too much foreign policy,\u2019\u201d this person said. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I have over done it. I did too much travel. I did too much back and forth. I did too much time change. I had a cold. That was a mistake.\u2019\u201d Biden\u00a0was referring to his back-to-back trips to France and Italy right before the debate,\u00a0even though he had nearly two weeks between his return on June 15 from Italy for the G7 meeting and the debate on June 27, according to a CNN review of his schedule. But as much as Biden suggested that the jet lag and exhaustion from his travels had been detrimental, he also signaled that he wanted to put the debate in the rearview mirror in his conversation with the ally. And at one point in their conversation, Biden asked this person for advice \u2013 and then there was silence, the person told CNN, as the president waited for input. But even in the highest levels of Biden\u2019s own administration, serious doubt is starting to set in about whether the president will be able to ride this one out. A senior Biden administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity told CNN that they\u00a0personally\u00a0view the current trend of the gradual erosion of support for Biden among Democrats as \u201cwaves crashing into the shore.\u201d \u201cFirst it\u2019s the donors. And then it\u2019s elected officials. Now it\u2019s going to be polling. It just breaks down the resistance,\u201d they said. \u201cThere\u2019s a group that started small and is getting bigger and bigger.\u201d The senior official said Biden would likely need some time to \u201creconcile\u201d the \u201cpull and the push\u201d as he navigates and digests the coming days and hears from those who believe he should dig in, as well as others who will tell him to step aside for the good of the party. Two sitting House Democrats have so far called on the president to abandon his reelection bid. Where Biden\u2019s family will end up is an important unknowable at the moment, the official added: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how defiant the family is going to be, which is a big factor.\u201d The president\u00a0said\u00a0at a fundraiser in Virginia Tuesday night that going on two significant foreign trips right before the debate had been a bad idea. During that fundraiser, Biden joked that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d during the debate last week and blamed his poor performance on his grueling travel schedule, according to pool reports. \u201cI decided to travel around the world a couple of times \u2026 shortly before the debate \u2026 I didn\u2019t listen to my staff \u2026 and then I almost fell asleep onstage,\u201d Biden said during the fundraiser. The remark was met with brief laughter from those in attendance, according to a recording of the president\u2019s remarks. Multiple reporters who were in the room said that they believed the \u201cfell asleep\u201d line appeared intended to be a joke and that Biden was trying to make light of the situation in a self-deprecating way, but it did not land, in their view. Since the debate,\u00a0Biden has faced one of the toughest stretches of his presidency\u00a0and\u00a0his reelection campaign is reeling.\u00a0Campaign officials are scrambling to calm donors who were shocked by Biden\u2019s\u00a0performance. The White House announced that Biden\u00a0is expected to\u00a0meet with Democratic governors and congressional leaders Wednesday after\u00a0some\u00a0demanded a meeting with the president. Some officials have been\u00a0turned off by the Biden campaign\u2019s dismissiveness over their concerns\u00a0about the president\u2019s health. On\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0a Democratic member of Congress\u00a0became the first to\u00a0publicly\u00a0ask Biden to drop out of the race. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris called into the Biden campaign\u2019s all-staff call on Wednesday, a source familiar with the call said. The source described it as a \u201cpep talk\u201d in which Biden and Harris detailed the stakes of the election. Biden reiterated that when\u00a0one gets\u00a0knocked down,\u00a0they need to get\u00a0back up, a familiar refrain from the past week, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go win this,\u201d the source said. Biden \u201cacknowledged\u00a0the tough past few days and said unequivocally to his team he is running for reelection and he is going to beat Donald Trump,\u201d another source familiar with the call told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m in this race to the end and we\u2019re going to win because when Democrats unite, we will always win. Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we\u2019re going to beat him again in 2024,\u201d Biden told his team, according to that source. Harris, who is dismissing calls to replace Biden, told the team that she will follow Biden\u2019s lead. \u201cWe will not back down. We will follow our president\u2019s lead. We will fight, and we will win,\u201d Harris said, according to the source. Biden concluded, according to the source: \u201cThere is no one I\u2019d rather be in this battle with than all of you. So, let\u2019s link arms. Let\u2019s get this done. You, me, the vice president. Together.\u201d White House chief of staff Jeff Zients held a less than 10-minute all-staff call to encourage his team to tune out the chatter and press ahead with their work even as questions about Biden\u2019s candidacy swirl, one source who participated in the call said. Keep your \u201cheads down, get things done, execution, execution, execution. Second, heads up \u2013 there\u2019s so much to be proud of and there\u2019s so much more we will do together under this president\u2019s leadership,\u201d Zients said, according to the source. \u00a0\u201cThis team can do anything and don\u2019t forget to have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d Zients, who did not take questions on the call, told staff that the \u201cstrong campaign team\u201d will focus on the reelection efforts while staff at the White House should focus on executing the work of the administration, the source said. Zients decided to convene a call with White House staff in part to acknowledge the challenges of the post-debate period, a White House official said. In a previous meeting with senior staff on Friday, Zients and senior adviser Anita Dunn spoke about the president\u2019s debate performance and the expected difficult period ahead, the official said. On Wednesday\u2019s call, Zients echoed the president, declaring, \u201cWhen you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what he is doing and that\u2019s what we all need to do,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_rfk-jr-eating-dog-vanity-fair", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has denied allegations made in a new Vanity Fair report that he had previously eaten a dog while sidestepping accusations of sexual assault levied by a former nanny in the magazine, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a church boy.\u201d In an interview with the \u201cBreaking Points\u201d political podcast released Tuesday, Kennedy called the Vanity Fair article \u201ca lot of garbage\u201d but acknowledged that his past included \u201cmany skeletons in my closet.\u201d The article alleges that Kennedy texted a message to a friend last year that included a photograph that showed him pantomiming eating a cooked animal carcass. In the message, Kennedy reportedly recommended the friend try eating dog while traveling in Korea. Vanity Fair reported that the photo\u2019s digital metadata shows it was taken in 2010 and that the publication consulted with a veterinarian who said the carcass in the photo appeared to be a dog\u2019s. Kennedy said the image depicted him eating a goat during a trip to South America. \u201cThe article is a lot of garbage. The picture that they said is of me eating a dog, it\u2019s actually me eating a goat in Patagonia on a whitewater trip many years ago on the Futaleufu River. They say \u2026 they have an expert that has identified that as a dog carcass. It\u2019s just not true,\u201d Kennedy said. The Vanity Fair article also features Eliza Cooney, a former part-time babysitter who worked for Kennedy between 1998 and 1999, alleging that he groped her in his kitchen. Kennedy declined to directly acknowledge the sexual assault accusation at first, instead dismissing \u201cthe other allegations\u201d as part of a \u201cvery, very rambunctious youth.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said this from the beginning. I am not a church boy. I am not running like that. I said \u2026 I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I have \u2026 so many skeletons in my closet, that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world,\u201d Kennedy said, adding, \u201cVanity Fair is recycling 30-year-old stories, and I, you know, am not gonna comment on the details of any of them.\u201d When asked directly whether he denied sexually assaulting Cooney, Kennedy repeated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on it.\u201d In a social media post later Tuesday, Kennedy shared the image published by Vanity Fair of him allegedly holding a cooked dog and denied the photo depicted him eating a dog. He did not address the sexual assault allegations in the post. \u201cHey @VanityFair, you know when your veterinary experts call a goat a dog, and your forensic experts say a photo taken in Patagonia was taken in Korea, that you\u2019ve joined the ranks of supermarket tabloids,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cKeep telling America that up is down if you want. I\u2019ll keep talking about the fact that working families can\u2019t afford houses or groceries because our last two presidents went on a $14 trillion debt joyride, paid for by hard-working Americans.\u201d The accusations made in the Vanity Fair article come at a trying time for Kennedy\u2019s campaign as he seeks to expand his support across the country for his independent presidential bid. Kennedy is on the ballot in seven states but is facing opposition from Biden allies seeking to block his access in several more. Recent polls have found Kennedy in a stagnant position against Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. A CNN poll released Tuesday found Kennedy earning 14% support in a multi-candidate race, behind Trump (41%) and Biden (35%). Those findings are roughly similar to a CNN poll released in November that showed Kennedy taking 16% compared with 41% for Trump and 35% for Biden. The independent candidate also faces an uphill battle in fundraising after bringing in $2.6 million to his campaign in May and spending $6.3 million as he burns through funds in his push for ballot access. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has already weathered a series of unconventional headlines. In May, Kennedy detailed a medical abnormality he experienced in 2010 that he said was caused by a parasitic worm that entered his brain and died. Kennedy said the worm caused him to experience \u201cbrain fog\u201d and trouble with \u201cword retrieval and short-term memory,\u201d but added that the issue has been resolved.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/rfk-jr-eating-dog-vanity-fair/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_democrats-biden-congress-what-matters", "text": "Democrats\u2019 collective freakout over the fitness of President Joe Biden hinges first and foremost on his ability to beat former President Donald Trump. But in the distressed comments of lawmakers and strategists lurks the additional fact that the House and Senate are also up for grabs in November \u2013 and if voters turn on Biden, it could reverberate across the country and hand Republicans unified control of the federal government. Damage control measures from the White House and Biden campaign are coming In an effort to prove Biden can still think on his feet, he\u2019ll meet the press and interact with lawmakers \u2013 things, shockingly, he has not already done in the wake of last week\u2019s debate. There are plans for a meeting with nervous Democratic governors this week; an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News, with clips to be aired at the end of the week; and a Biden-hosted press conference during next week\u2019s NATO summit. Lawmaker calls on president to drop out with nod to Biden drag The first evidence of actual fracture among Democrats is already here. It appeared on Tuesday when Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a longtime Democratic congressman from Texas, became the first elected Democrat at the national level to reluctantly call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. Doggett appealed to Biden\u2019s sense of patriotism in a statement and noted that Biden is underperforming Democratic candidates for Senate in key states around the country. Incumbent presidents are supposed leave coattails for down-ballot candidates to ride in their wake. For Democrats this year, even before Biden\u2019s bad debate performance, the opposite was true. Biden may be a drag on Democrats\u2019 already long prospects to keep the Senate. Senate majority is at risk With a 51-49 majority, Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) have a tenuous hold on power in the Senate and are on defense in multiple consequential races. Twenty-three seats currently held by Democrats are on the line in November compared with 11 held by Republicans. One Democratic seat, currently held by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 who is not running for reelection and left the Democratic Party to register as an independent \u2013 is likely to move to the Republican column. Implications for decades Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, did not call on Biden to withdraw from the race, but he did point out that the president\u2019s decision on whether to continue his campaign will have implications that extend well beyond the presidency and his own personal legacy. \u201cHis decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come,\u201d Quigley said. In the House, Democrats could be within striking distance of a majority since Republicans currently hold only a slight 219-213 majority. \u2018Team sport,\u2019 and Biden needs help Biden\u2019s old boss, former President Barack Obama, appeared at a New York City fundraiser last Friday alongside Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the New Yorker and top Democrat in the House who Democrats would very much like to be speaker. Obama said general elections are like a \u201cteam sport\u201d and the president is captain, according to CNN\u2019s report, but in this case voters should be motivated by down-ballot races. \u201cWe need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d The not-so-subtle implication there is that Biden will need to be propped up by other Democrats in order to win. Fearing a \u2018MAGA trifecta\u2019 The Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator Paul Begala predicted on Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d that pressure on Biden is only just beginning since lawmakers are headed home to talk to their constituents over the July Fourth holiday. \u201cI think voters are going to say, are you out of your mind? Because Democrats are worried that not only will Biden lose to Trump, but that he\u2019ll drag down the House and the Senate as well. And you\u2019ll have a MAGA trifecta \u2013 which Mr. Trump himself says will be a dictatorship, at least for a day,\u201d Begala told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Presidents are more productive in periods of unified government Recent presidents have made their most lasting marks during periods of unified government, usually at the outset of their presidencies. It was when Democrats controlled the House, Senate and White House during his first two years in office that Biden signed the massive Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the PACT Act to improve care for veterans and more. It was when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House during his first two years in office that Trump signed some permanent corporate tax cuts into law. The Affordable Care Act under Obama? Unified government. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which turns 60 years old on Tuesday? Unified government. Granted, neither party is likely to have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate to easily pass major and sweeping legislation. But certainly controlling the elected portions of the federal government creates an environment for productivity. There has been lots of reporting about how Trump and his supporters will be better prepared to change the nature of government if they are to win in November. With the House and Senate, they could make more priorities permanent. \u2018Just sit there and be Joe\u2019 Even party stalwarts on the level of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose main goal for decades has been winning and keeping the House, said Biden must prove to Democrats and voters that he is still up to the job. She recommended he give a series of interviews or town halls. \u201cJust sit there and be Joe,\u201d Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday. \u201cShow your values, show your knowledge, show your judgment.\u201d But Pelosi also said of Biden\u2019s debate performance that it is a \u201clegitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition.\u201d While she quickly added that this was a legitimate question for Trump as well, citing his repeated lies during the debate, that\u2019s far from an unqualified endorsement of his ability to be president \u2013 and she said both Trump and Biden could stand to take a cognitive test of some kind. \u201cBoth candidates owe whatever test you want to put them to, in terms of their mental acuity and their health \u2013 both of them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/democrats-biden-congress-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_us-government-employees-gaza-policy-statement", "text": "The US government employees who have publicly resigned in protest of the Biden administration\u2019s Gaza policies released a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0on Tuesday for the first time, stating they \u201cstand united in a shared belief that it is our collective responsibility to speak up\u201d and outlining steps they believe the US government should take. The 12 signatories tendered their resignations at various points over the course of the nearly nine-month conflict between Israel and Hamas, with one resigning as recently as Tuesday. Many of them have spoken out, including to CNN, about their decisions to publicly leave in protest of the administration\u2019s policies. As\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0last month, the officials had begun banding together to put pressure on the government to change course. Tuesday\u2019s statement was released in conjunction with the July Fourth holiday, noting that \u201cas our nation celebrates its Independence Day, each of us are reminded that we resigned from government not to terminate that oath but to continue to abide by it; not to end our commitment to service, but to extend it.\u201d \u201cThe Administration\u2019s policy in Gaza is a failure and a threat to U.S. national security,\u201d they write in the joint statement, titled \u201cService in Dissent.\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to, Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza. This is not only morally reprehensible and in clear violation of international humanitarian law and U.S. laws, but it has also put a target on America\u2019s back,\u201d they continue, arguing that it has put the lives of service members and diplomats at risk. President Joe Biden has faced pressure both abroad and at home over his\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0in its war in Gaza\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0conflict\u00a0that has cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, displaced millions and brought extreme hunger throughout the enclave. Although the rhetoric from the administration has become harsher \u2013 with warnings that Israel must do more to protect civilians and allow more aid in \u2013 the policies have remained largely unchanged. The resigned officials argue that the US policy toward Gaza has \u201cbeen deeply damaging not only for U.S relations in the region, but for our global credibility, the credibility of U.S. values, and the credibility of the West \u2014 a particularly perilous state of affairs in the context of this era of strategic competition.\u201d The joint statement lays out six recommendations to the US government. Among them are a call for the US government to \u201cfaithfully execute the law,\u201d saying that \u201cit is abundantly clear that the Administration is currently willfully violating multiple U.S. laws and attempting to deny or distort facts, use loopholes, or manipulate processes to ensure a continuous flow of lethal weapons to Israel.\u201d It also calls for the government to use \u201call necessary and available leverage to bring the conflict to an immediate close\u201d; expansion of humanitarian aid; support of the self-determination of the Palestinian people; stronger oversight and accountability mechanisms within the executive branch; and support of freedom of speech for college protesters. Resigned officials who previously spoke with CNN said many of their former colleagues felt similarly to them but were not in a position to resign. The joint statement concludes with a message to such colleagues, telling them that their \u201cvoice matters.\u201d \u201cWe encourage you to keep pushing. In our experience, no decision point is too minor to challenge, so while you are in government service, use your voice, write letters to leaders in your agencies, and bring up your disagreements with your team,\u201d they continue. \u201cSpeaking out has a snowball effect, inspiring others to use their voice. There is strength in numbers, and we urge you to not be complicit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/us-government-employees-gaza-policy-statement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
