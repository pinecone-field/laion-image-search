Smith\u2019s office\u00a0has requested\u00a0that the Florida judge overseeing the classified documents case, Aileen Cannon, place a gag order on the former president that would limit his ability to publicly talk about law enforcement that searched his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, has repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the search \u2013 as the bureau does with every warrant it executes. In a blistering court filing late on Memorial Day, attorneys for Trump said that the gag order request was an \u201cextraordinary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional censorship application\u201d to target Trump\u2019s speech as he runs for president. The special counsel \u201cimproperly asks the Court to impose an unconstitutional gag order on President Trump \u2026 based on vague and unsupported assertions about threats to law enforcement personnel whose names have been redacted from public filings and whose identities are already subject to a protective order,\u201d defense attorneys wrote. The attorneys also said that prosecutors, whom they referred to as \u201cself-appointed Thought Police,\u201d were \u201cseeking to condition President Trump\u2019s liberty on his compliance\u201d with their own views. Among the parts of the proposed gag order that Trump\u2019s attorneys most fiercely contested was Smith\u2019s request to incorporate the gag order into the former president\u2019s conditions of pre-trial release \u2013 meaning that a probation officer, not the judge, would decide whether Trump\u2019s comments constituted a violation. That structure would\u00a0\u201crequire the Probation Office and the Court to mediate disputes against a backdrop of potentially imprisoning a political opponent who is successfully defeating Smith\u2019s boss and preferred candidate,\u201d they wrote. Beyond rejecting the gag order request, Cannon should impose sanctions on \u201call government attorneys who participated in the decision to file the Motion,\u201d Trump\u2019s team said. The former president is separately under a gag order in the Washington, DC, federal election interference case and in his ongoinng hush money trial in New York state court. The special counsel said Friday that Trump\u2019s false claims had endangered law enforcement officers \u2013 some of whom could testify in the classified documents case.\u00a0His comments, prosecutors wrote, \u201cinvite the sort of threats and harassment that have occurred when other participants in legal proceedings against Trump have been targeted by his invective.\u201d Both the FBI and Attorney General Merrick Garland have rejected claims that the operation\u2019s plan to search Mar-a-Lago was somehow unique and that Trump\u2019s life, as the former president has claimed, was in danger. Garland last week called the allegation \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cextremely dangerous,\u201d while the FBI said in a statement that \u201cno one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\u201d Garland and the FBI have also noted that the same deadly force policy was included in plans before a search of President Joe Biden\u2019s Delaware home during a separate investigation into his own handling of classified documents.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/politics/trump-response-classified-documents-gag-order/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-closing-arguments-trial-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial has arrived at its dramatic final act with lawyers for both sides primed on Tuesday to hammer home their cases before jurors consider a verdict that could make history. The summations mark the climax of a trial that started more than a month ago. They are expected to last all day Tuesday and could stretch into the following day. After Judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law, Trump and the rest of the country will be held in suspense to see whether he will become the first ex-president and presumptive GOP nominee to be convicted of a crime after allegedly falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. The verdict will reverberate far beyond the courtroom and Trump\u2019s personal life since the case has become intertwined with his bid to reclaim the White House. The stakes are especially high since this is likely to be the only one of four pending criminal trials expected to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The former president appeared to be in a bitter mood on the eve of his return to the courtroom, lashing out at opponents he called \u201cHuman Scum\u201d in a message on social media marking Memorial Day. Trump\u2019s defense team is trying to spare their client the ignominy of a conviction that would stain his reputation. The ex-president\u2019s lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, is expected to zero in on the credibility of Trump\u2019s former fixer-turned-nemesis, Michael Cohen, who endured a bruising cross-examination, and to ask why other key figures in the ex-president\u2019s business and personal orbit were not called by prosecutors, CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell reported. Joshua Steinglass, who is conducting closing arguments for the prosecution, will follow Blanche and is expected to spend several hours taking the jury through text messages, phone logs, other witnesses\u2019 testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen\u2019s testimony. Ultimately, the team working for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will try to convince seven men and five women jurors that Trump orchestrated a scheme to keep unflattering information from voters in what was an early example of election interference. Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers do not have to convince all of the jury that he is innocent \u2014 they need only one juror to stand firm against the unanimous guilty verdict required to convict. Their conduct of the trial, in which they produced only two witnesses in a brief defense, signals they will argue that the state of New York has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ex-president ordered and carried out a scheme, which, in any case, they say doesn\u2019t amount to breaking the law. They argued during the trial that there was no evidence of criminal intent. And they will seek to leave jurors with a devastating final picture of Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and was benefiting financially from a growing media empire targeting his ex-boss. While there is a big difference with a hung jury that could force the judge to declare a mistrial, leaving an opening for prosecutors to try Trump again, any outcome that doesn\u2019t end in a conviction could serve Trump\u2019s political purposes, at least for now. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the voting public sees much of a difference between the two. For many, including the defendant, the only relevant question is whether he is a convicted felon or not,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams. \u201cSo, I\u2019d assume the defense is really just hoping to plant a seed in the head of that one juror who has enough doubts about the\u00a0case and might be stubborn enough not to back down.\u201d Cohen will be at the center of the drama again Blanche argued earlier in the month that Cohen was so conflicted as a witness that the case should not even go to the jury. He told the judge: \u201cHe testified. And he lied under oath. In this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, is a conviction, potentially.\u201d Closing arguments are the stage in a case where lawyers summarize weeks of complex testimony and courtroom theatrics and sketch a narrative designed to shape the deliberations over evidence in the jury room. They are also used to impress upon jurors the huge stakes of a trial \u2014 both the grave reality that a person\u2019s reputation and even liberty is on the line and the importance of upholding the rule of law. The jury in this case must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York state prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records \u2014 which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime \u2014 in this case in relation to the 2016 election. The prosecution is likely to argue that while the defense roughed up Cohen, he was truthful about the key elements of the case, and that his testimony was corroborated in advance by weeks of evidence. Former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Sunday that it was not important how jurors generally viewed Cohen as a person. \u201cWhether you like Michael Cohen, whether you\u2019d want him to date your sister, whether you\u2019d want (him) to be your brother-in-law \u2026 you don\u2019t have to like the guy. This is not a likability contest. (Was he) truthful in that moment in time? Was he honest and credible?\u201d In days of evidence, the prosecution built a brick-by-brick legal edifice to pre-but the attacks on Cohen\u2019s credibility, which everyone knew were coming since the man who described himself as Trump\u2019s former \u201cthug\u201d went to jail for offenses including lying to Congress. \u201cThere were weeks and weeks of testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a conspiracy,\u201d\u00a0prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued in court. That evidence was intended to create a storyline that highlighted Trump\u2019s alleged affair with Daniels, in explicit detail, in order to explain to jurors why he might have wanted to cover it up. They secured testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker to highlight Trump\u2019s history of shutting down embarrassing stories, and they produced evidence from former Trump associates, including ex-White House communications director Hope Hicks, to counter the idea Trump was simply seeking to hide his embarrassment about Daniels from his family and was instead most worried about voters forming an unfavorable impression of him in 2016. Prosecutors also sketched a paper trail to suggest that Cohen was acting on the ex-president\u2019s orders in making a $130,000 payment to Daniels and that Trump was involved in cooking the financial books while serving as president to disguise a reimbursement to his former fixer. Another test of Trump\u2019s brittle self-control Tuesday\u2019s closing arguments will create another personal test for Trump, whose attacks on witnesses previously caused Merchan to warn he could be jailed over further violations of a partial gag order. While staying just inside Merchan\u2019s red line, Trump has continued to fire off daily rhetorical attacks on the judge, prosecutors and the Justice Department, along with false claims that the trial is part of an overarching conspiracy by President Joe Biden to destroy him before Election Day. Trump has raised doubts that the 12 New Yorkers who will judge him in the city where he made his name will give him a fair trial. And he has been aided by a parade of Republican supporters, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up to bolster Trump\u2019s assault on the justice system. Trump\u2019s belligerence would be incredible coming from any defendant, let alone one seeking to reassume his role as titular head and ultimate defender of the Constitution as the 47th president. Just over five months from the election, it\u2019s unclear if or how public opinion that is already polarized around Trump will shift when the verdict is announced. The trial has not gripped the attention of the country as it might have were television cameras allowed in the courtroom. And Trump used his multiple criminal indictments to his political advantage in clearing the Republican nominating field. But some polls suggest a conviction could weigh against him in a tight election with Biden. Past behavior also suggests Trump would use any acquittal or a mistrial caused by a hung jury to claim vindication in all his criminal cases and to fuel the campaign of personal and political vengeance around which he\u2019s promised to build a second presidency. The final arguments will go ahead following an unusual weeklong break in the trial that occurred since Merchan wanted to avoid final arguments and jury instruction being interrupted by the Memorial Day holiday. The time off only seems to have escalated Trump\u2019s fury as one of the defining weeks of his life dawns. \u201cHappy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network that was especially jarring on a day dedicated to fallen members of the military. Trump fulminated against judges who had presided over a massive fraud judgment against him, his firm and his adult sons that was worth nearly half a billion dollars and a defamation suit in which he was ordered to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million. Trump concluded his tirade with the words: \u201cNow for Merchan!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-closing-arguments-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters", "text": "With a holiday weekend happening between the final witness testimony and closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money criminal trial, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to look back at what we\u2019ve just seen. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb were inside the courtroom and an adjacent viewing room for all of the oral arguments \u2013 for all 20 days over the course of a month when the trial was in session. While these are the first criminal trial proceedings against Trump, he also faced a civil fraud trial brought by the New York attorney general and two separate defamation lawsuits brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A judge found Trump liable for fraud for inflating his net worth to get friendly loans, and juries found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defaming Carroll. CNN\u2019s reporters have covered all of the trials. I talked to Herb and del Valle about how they went about getting what happened in court out to the world in almost real time and what people watching on TV might have missed. Portions of those conversations, conducted by phone and email and edited for length, are below: What will you take away from covering this trial? DEL VALLE: This is actually my fourth Trump trial. They\u2019ve all been different. This is the first one where he\u2019s had to be there every second. We saw different versions of him, I would say, at each trial. He didn\u2019t show up to the first E. Jean Carroll trial. He came to some of civil fraud trial for big days. He did briefly get up on the stand, and that was a moment in itself that we didn\u2019t get to see here in the criminal trial. We saw a very angry Trump at the second E. Jean Carroll trial where he walked out of closing, was very emotional and had tension with the judge. Here, it\u2019s almost been interesting how at moments it just felt like a regular trial. That\u2019s never really been the case; we go through two levels of security, we have to wait in line hours before the trial starts, and we\u2019re very much controlled by the security for Trump, and that\u2019s not normal. But at the same time, Trump as a defendant has to sit there every second of the day. There are times where you can forget that you are watching the first former president to be on trial facing criminal charges. It\u2019s a shake yourself kind of moment to see him sit there like any other defendant I\u2019ve seen in that courtroom facing what could be a conviction. How did you cover a trial without cameras in real time for coverage on TV? HERB: Kara, Lauren and I watched every day of the trial unfold from two places: inside the courtroom or in an \u201coverflow\u201d auxiliary courtroom, where the proceedings were played on closed-circuit television. This was a historic trial, of course, and we used a brand-new method of filing updates to try to keep readers and viewers informed of what was happening literally second by second. This was possible because the press corps was allowed to use laptops in court (strictly no recording!), so we frantically took notes and then transmitted what we were seeing in real time to a Slack channel. From there, our editors quickly read our Slacks and added them to\u00a0CNN.com\u2019s live story, as well as to a \u201csidestream\u201d feed that was displayed live on air. The idea was to put readers and viewers in the room as best we could \u2013 our dispatches were sent mostly in single sentences so that we could keep updating as quickly as possible. Between the three of us, we tried to capture every moment, big and small, both in terms of quotes being said by the attorneys and witnesses as well as how others in the courtroom \u2013 mainly Trump \u2013 were reacting to what was happening. What did TV viewers miss? HERB: We tried to use descriptive language to describe what we were seeing and hearing, but words can only go so far to replace audio or video. I think it was often hard to capture the tone of a conversation, particularly when it got contentious. We also couldn\u2019t really convey what the jury was thinking \u2013 reporters were far enough away from the jurors that we could see them taking notes or watching the lawyers and witnesses, but it\u2019s hard to know whether they were truly engaged or how they were taking any given bit of testimony. What could you see of Trump? HERB: We made sure to have at least one person in the courtroom and one in overflow, because they give you two different vantage points. Reporters in the courtroom sat behind Trump \u2013 with a view often blocked by the many officers in the aisles of the gallery. In the overflow room, there was a big-screen TV set up that showed four shots: the prosecutors, the defense table, the judge and the witness. From the overflow room, that gave us a clear view of Trump\u2019s face, meaning we could see whether his eyes were closed (which didn\u2019t mean he was necessarily sleeping!). We could also see when he smirked or smiled at something or was writing and passing notes to his attorneys. From the courtroom, that same TV feed was displayed, but it was on a much smaller screen and farther away \u2013 some reporters had binoculars to try to get a better view. What were the most dramatic moments? During Stormy Daniels\u2019 testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Midway through the trial, Stormy, in vivid detail, describing certain things that were entirely taboo, that we wouldn\u2019t really expect to hear in a courtroom, was certainly, I wouldn\u2019t say dramatic, but it was definitely a moment that became a sideshow. It\u2019s not necessarily directly tied to the allegations or the charges in this case, but hearing her describe this alleged night with Trump in the hotel room, down to the anecdote of her smacking him on the butt with a magazine and his reaction in court, audibly cursing at that moment, was definitely a memory. During Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Then, during Cohen\u2019s testimony, on cross-examination (Trump attorney) Todd Blanche built up into what Blanche clearly thought was a gotcha moment, suggesting that Cohen made up a call keeping Trump informed in the Daniels scheme. Blanche suggested it was actually a call with Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, about a 14-year-old prankster who had been prank calling Cohen \u2026 in that moment, Blanche was flailing his arms, yelling in a high-pitched tone, telling Cohen he made this up. Cohen responded that, well, no, I think we could have talked about both things at the same time, or I believe this is the call. And Blanche told him the jury isn\u2019t here to hear what you believe. They need to know what the facts are. And that was right before a lunch break, and it kind of left energy in the room, and set a tone for the rest of the day. When the judge cleared the courtroom \u2026 HERB: The most dramatic moment I think happened when the jury was out of the room during the testimony of the final witness, Robert Costello. His testimony had been limited by the judge ahead of time, and prosecutors were successfully objecting repeatedly to Trump lawyer Emil Bove\u2019s questions. Costello was visibly annoyed at this, and even uttered \u201cridiculous\u201d while the attorneys were at a sidebar with the judge. When he let out a \u201cjeez\u201d after another objection, Judge Juan Merchan excused the jury to admonish the decorum of the witness, (who is) an attorney and former federal prosecutor. That\u2019s when things really got heated. \u201cAre you staring me down right now?\u201d Merchan said to Costello after dressing him down. \u201cClear the courtroom!\u201d the judge announced, leading to chaos as court officers forced reporters \u2013 and the attorney representing the media \u2013 to leave the courtroom over vigorous objections. DEL VALLE: I\u2019ve been in this courtroom for other trials many times. I have not seen a judge clear the courtroom of press to admonish a witness in a sidebar in such a way. The way Merchan handled that was definitely a surprise. How did Trump interact with the friends and aides whom he had not spoken to in some time and who testified for the prosecution? David Pecker, Trump\u2019s longtime friend who tried to use the National Enquirer to help \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories that could hurt Trump \u2026 DEL VALLE: It felt like by the end, Pecker was maybe trying to send Trump a message. Even though they have not spoken since all of this unraveled in 2018, Pecker made a point of saying really positive things about Trump. How long they\u2019ve known each other and had a really strong relationship. How, even though they haven\u2019t spoken recently, Trump has sent him a hello through other people that he\u2019s run into. He still considers Trump a friend all these years later. By the end there, it felt like Trump was watching him and listening to these words, like, who knows, maybe they could be friends publicly again. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary and White House communications director who has since moved on from Trump\u2019s orbit \u2026 DEL VALLE: It was interesting because she made a point of saying that she was paying for her own attorney. She was not by any means still tied to Trump, but she was actually overcome with emotion when they started the cross-examination. She was so nervous the whole time, but especially when it came to how she might be treated by Trump\u2019s side. I think her candor also caught Trump\u2019s attention, and he was definitely watching her at times \u2013 most of her testimony, actually. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump\u2019s former personal assistant at the White House \u2026 DEL VALLE: The one where it definitely felt like there was a connection \u2013 they exchanged eye contact when she came off the stand \u2013 was Madeleine Westerhout, who cried on the stand, was very emotional about the mistakes she made that led to her exit from the White House. She made clear how apologetic she was and what a great man she felt Trump was. He definitely was paying close attention to her and smiled at her at times, and seemed to give her a nod and a smile and maybe exchanged words with her on her way off the stand. Where were Trump\u2019s many supporters, including high-ranking Republican lawmakers? Was there any indication jurors recognized them? HERB: Both the prosecution and the defense were given the first two rows of seats behind their tables in the well for guests. On the prosecution side, District Attorney Alvin Bragg would sit here whenever he popped into the courtroom. On Trump\u2019s side, this was where the Republican lawmakers and other allies of Trump would sit. Trump aide Boris Epshteyn would often direct traffic and make sure they found their seats. On some days, Trump had so many people attending that a few would get relegated to the back row. As for the jury, it\u2019s hard to say whether they recognized any of the VIP guests. Every time they entered the courtroom, they walked past Trump\u2019s table \u2013 and 99% of the time, all of them looked straight ahead and not at the defendant or his guests. What less dramatic moments stand out? DEL VALLE: With Stormy, it was definitely interesting and we tried to describe it, but she was talking a mile a minute. The court reporter could not keep up at all. The prosecutor and the judge had to stop her several times to ask her to slow down. And at one point later in the day, on her direct examination, she leaned over to the court reporter and smiled at her, and said, \u201cAm I talking slower? Can you get it all?\u201d HERB: One of the things that isn\u2019t obvious if you aren\u2019t watching the proceedings is how collegial the lawyers on the opposing sides can be, even as they are viciously fighting against each other on the case and in rulings to try to help their side. During breaks, Blanche would occasionally jump to the other side of the well to speak with his counterparts, Susan Hoffinger or Joshua Steinglass, and more than a few laughs were shared with whatever it was they were discussing. While the press took up the majority of the seats, there were spaces dedicated to the general public \u2013 and some regulars who showed up every day, either sleeping overnight or, more likely, hiring line sitters who had a lucrative business throughout the trial saving spots in lines outside the courthouse for both media and the general public. My favorite light moment in court may have come when Trump attorney Emil Bove was cross-examining a paralegal for the district attorney\u2019s office, Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, who was testifying to enter into evidence call logs he had analyzed for the case. Bove asked him if putting together call summary charges could be \u201cat times, arguably, tedious work?\u201d \u201cHonestly, I kind of enjoyed it,\u201d Jarmel-Schneider said. The response prompted one of the biggest laughs in the courtroom in the entire trial \u2013 even several jurors were laughing. \u201cI hear that,\u201d Bove said in response. \u201cRespect.\u201d What will stick with you from covering this moment of history? HERB: This has easily been one of the most intense assignments I\u2019ve ever had at CNN. Not only is it historic and unprecedented, but the way we are covering it requires a constant focus throughout every hour of every day of the trial \u2013 and every moment, dramatic or monotonous \u2013 in order to make sure we are conveying it to our readers and viewers quickly and accurately. My hope is that I will be able look back at this unprecedented trial and be able to say we covered the historic moment fast and got it right (which I am not taking for granted until the trial is over!).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/politics/trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_michael-avenatti-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined an appeal from disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti, who argued that his extortion conviction was based on a vague anti-corruption law that shouldn\u2019t apply to lawyers making settlement demands. Best known for representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels, Avenatti was sentenced to a 30-month prison sentence in 2021 for demanding that Nike pay him more than $20 million to avoid going public with allegations of a scandal involving illicit payments to amateur basketball players. Avenatti, who has since been sentenced to additional prison time for other crimes, told the Supreme Court that his conviction for \u201chonest services fraud\u201d should be tossed because the crime is vague, particularly when it\u2019s applied to non-public officials. The crime can be charged against private individuals who have a fiduciary responsibility to clients, for instance. On his broad point, at least, Avenatti\u2019s argument has picked up some support from members of the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative wing. In a concurring opinion last year, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that courts have struggled for decades over how to apply the charge in the private sector. \u201cNo one can say what sort of fiduciary relationship is enough to sustain a federal felony conviction and decades in federal prison,\u201d Gorsuch wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Avenatti cited the Gorsuch opinion in his appeal and argued that the Supreme Court should invalidate the law. The Biden administration countered that Avenatti\u2019s conduct was well within the plain meaning of the prohibition \u2013 in other words, not a fringe case \u2013 and that his appeal was foreclosed by earlier Supreme Court precedent. He also argued that an attorney shouldn\u2019t be subject to criminal extortion charges as part of a settlement demand, though prosecutors argued in part that Avenatti was making his demands for himself, not his client. The New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to overturn Avenatti\u2019s conviction last year. Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he recused himself from the court\u2019s consideration of the appeal, though he didn\u2019t provide an explanation for his decision.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/michael-avenatti-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial", "text": "The slow-burning corruption trial of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is poised to reach a combustible new phase this week as prosecutors and defense lawyers test the boundaries of the court, the law and the federal judge running the show. US District Court Judge Sidney Stein, whose gentle speaking style belies his firm grip on the proceedings, has increasingly been faced with decisions about what evidence can and cannot be introduced \u2013 or even discussed \u2013 by the prosecution. The defense, too, has at times tested his patience with its questioning of witnesses and tactical objections. Nearly two weeks after a jury was selected and seated in Manhattan federal court, the question of Menendez\u2019s guilt or innocence, and that of his two co-defendants, appears to hinge on how Stein interprets the protections Menendez enjoys as a sitting US senator. Prosecutors have promised clear evidence that the New Jersey Democrat accepted bribes and acted, as stated in the indictment, as an agent for the Egyptian government. Menendez and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty. But even as the prosecution continues to lay the groundwork in this complex, sprawling case, defense lawyers \u2013 particularly those representing Menendez \u2013 are carefully seeking to zero out anecdotes, documents\u00a0and other details that they say are impermissible in cases of alleged corruption by public officials. Here are four questions expected to dominate the courtroom \u2013 and a congressional race on the other side of the Hudson River \u2013 over the coming week. Can prosecutors thread the (constitutional) needle? Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York are fighting a legal battle on two fronts. On one side, the government is being hit by the US Constitution\u2019s \u201cspeech or debate\u201d clause, a provision designed to shield lawmakers from having their congressional work used against them in a courtroom. On the other, prosecutors are also contending with a more recent precedent, from 2016, when the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell v. United States raised the bar for prosecutors trying to prove corruption charges against elected political leaders. This effectively means that some of the most potentially incriminating evidence against Menendez cannot be displayed or spoken of, at least not directly, in front of a jury. Neither side in the case was taken by surprise here. Menendez\u2019s defense is making clear use of both, while prosecutors have argued, broadly and in the back-and-forth over evidence, that their case is so strong as to be invulnerable to these challenges. Menendez is particularly well-drilled in some of these dynamics, having argued in 2017 that his previous corruption trial should be thrown out owing to protections he derived through the speech or debate clause. The Supreme Court rejected that bid, but his lawyers in this case (the previous one ended in a mistrial) are aggressively invoking the precedent to stifle prosecutors. The government\u2019s ability to sketch a clear and convincing picture for the jury despite these growing constraints will likely determine Menendez\u2019s legal fate. Will Menendez take the stand? The odds are long, yes, but it\u2019s not implausible. There is nothing yet to suggest that Menendez or his defense team is planning to make the high-risk, high-reward move \u2013 one that former President Donald Trump, on trial up the street in Manhattan Criminal Court, rejected before moving on to closing arguments. But the possibility is not as remote as many observers might expect \u2013 leaving the potential for another twist in this already sensational case. That potential has more to do with the makeup of the jury than how the case is unfolding in the courtroom. Specifically, it\u2019s the fact that most of the jurors are college-educated, with more than half holding graduate or postgraduate degrees. Their professions reflect as much \u2013 a banker, therapist and artist-turned-business owner among them. Many prosecutors believe \u2013 as a rule of thumb \u2013 that the more formally educated and professionally accomplished the jury, the more inclined it will be to hear directly from a defendant, especially if that person comes to court with a high profile or political power. It\u2019s unclear if this group of prosecutors takes that view \u2013 or, of course, whether the jury would give Menendez credit for taking the oath. What will the jury make of the Blame (Nadine) Game? The defense kicked off its case by pointing the finger at Nadine Menendez, the senator\u2019s wife, who is facing a separate but related trial this summer.\u00a0She has also pleaded not guilty. As the senator\u2019s lawyer told it, Nadine Menendez was keeping secrets \u2013 occasionally in the form of gold bars stored her bedroom closet \u2013 from her husband, while generally taking advantage of his power and cache to enrich the pair. \u201cShe kept things from him,\u201d lawyer Avi Weitzman told the jury. \u201cShe kept him in the dark.\u201d The prosecution, in its opening statement, told a different story. Assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz said that the senator used \u201chis wife as a go-between\u201d with his co-defendants and foreign agents. \u201c(She) communicated with the bribe payers, she passed messages to Menendez, and she collected some of the bribes,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cAll in exchange for Menendez\u2019s promises to use his power as a senator.\u201d Was Nadine Menendez a bit player who aided her husband in crimes that benefitted them both, as the prosecution insists \u2013 or was she, as the defense argues, something more like a mastermind? The jury\u2019s answer to that question could decide the case. How does it play back home? Weeks before the jury in Lower Manhattan renders their verdict on Menendez, voters in North Jersey\u2019s 8th Congressional District will have a say on his family\u2019s political standing. Menendez himself is not running for reelection in the Democratic primary on June 4, but his son, freshman Rep. Rob Menendez Jr., is on the ballot and facing a serious challenge from Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla. Menendez Jr. was first elected to the seat in 2022 following the retirement of Democrat Albio Sires, who succeeded Bob Menendez in an earlier version of the seat in 2006 when the latter was appointed to the Senate. Though Bhalla has not argued outright that his opponent is corrupt or should be held accountable for his father\u2019s alleged crimes, some of the outside groups supporting him certainly are. \u201cThey say the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, so it\u2019s no wonder that Rob Menendez is defending his father\u2019s corruption,\u201d said one TV ad from America\u2019s Promise, a super PAC backing Bhalla. \u201cJersey has enough bad apples. Rob Menendez \u2013 rotten to the core.\u201d Menendez Jr. directly addressed that line of attack in a recent spot of his own. \u201cMy opponent wants to run against my father because he\u2019s scared to run against me. That\u2019s on him,\u201d Menendez Jr. says, speaking straight to camera. \u201cI\u2019m focused on fighting for you.\u201d The recent backlash\u00a0against Garden State Democrats\u2019 uniquely powerful political machine has also played a significant role in the campaign, perhaps even more than the comings and goings of the trial. But for Menendez, the senator and father, the will of the 8th District\u2019s primary voters could weigh heavily on his political future \u2013 and legacy.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_republicans-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Top Republicans are already rushing to buy into a new 2024 election fraud narrative sown by ex-President Donald Trump in their zeal to appease their party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Leading\u00a0party figures are increasingly warning they will only recognize the result of November\u2019s presidential vote if there is no fraud. But there is no indication that there will be irregularities in the election. And their warnings come despite many Republican state legislatures taking steps to tighten voting rules \u2014 based on Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in 2020. The new Republican trend of casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election in advance was exhibited by Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. The Texas lawmaker, who in 2016\u00a0fell in\u00a0line behind Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s insults about his father and his wife, falsely stated that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of voting irregularities, multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, rejected the former president\u2019s claims he was cheated out of power. And Trump\u2019s then-attorney general, William Barr, looked into his claims and decided that there was no widespread fraud that would have changed the result of the election. But Cruz told Collins that a question about whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election was \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time.\u201d Cruz, who objected to election results in Arizona, which Trump narrowly lost to Biden, on January 6, 2021, went on to suggest there was significant fraud in 2020. And he implied the same could happen this year. \u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz said. A sign of Trump\u2019s power The equivocating of senior Republicans appears motivated by a fear of crossing Trump, the twice-impeached GOP leader who has the power to end careers in the party simply by turning against an individual lawmaker. The positioning looks a lot like laying the groundwork for a challenge to the fairness of the 2024 election if Trump loses in November. Undermining an election even before it happens represents a grave threat to democracy. The attempt to raise the specter of election fraud this year is especially corrosive because of the likelihood that the 2024 vote will be decided in a handful of swing states by mere thousands of ballots and raises the possibility of prolonged legal action by Trump\u2019s camp that would tarnish yet another US election. Trump is still claiming falsely that Mike Pence had the constitutional authority power to overturn the 2020 election result, and the former vice president has been largely ostracized within his party for following the Constitution and overseeing the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Cruz is just one of the latest senior party figures to try to avoid getting on the wrong side of Trump when asked whether they will accept the result of the 2024 election. The attempt to win Trump\u2019s favor follows an interview that Trump gave to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper earlier this month. \u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results. I don\u2019t change on that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d His comments carried the implicit threat that he will decide if he loses, as he did in 2020, that the election was not fair. Trump frequently claims he did better in the popular vote four years ago than any incumbent president, creating a false argument that it was therefore impossible to lose to Biden, who got more votes. Trump\u2019s renewed election denialism is disturbing for several reasons. First, it mirrors his pre-election spin in 2020, when he suggested that the election might not be fair \u2014 which he later built upon after losing to Biden with a widespread campaign that culminated in the mob attack by his supporters on the Capitol\u00a0that was\u00a0designed to thwart the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Trump often leaves the impression that any election he loses cannot, by definition, be legitimate. His false claims about election fraud in 2020 are now believed by millions of Republican voters despite the fact that he has been indicted twice \u2014 in a federal case and in Georgia \u2014 for his attempts to steal the election and stay in power. Comments like Cruz\u2019s on Wednesday serve to create an expectation among some voters that the coming election will not be fair, even though there is no indication that this, or any other US election, will be tarnished by fraud,\u00a0which historically has only taken place at very low levels. Republican senators try to demonstrate loyalty to Trump The Texas senator is far from the only senior party figure to buy into Trump\u2019s claims,\u00a0a trend that shows the sheer power of Trump in the GOP. It also follows the announcement by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Wednesday that she will vote for Trump despite having called him \u201cunhinged\u201d and unfit to serve in the Oval Office again during her primary campaign earlier this year. Her move appeared to be an attempt to retain viability in the Republican Party for any future run for president. It seems like it should be easy for Republicans just to state that they will accept the result of the 2024 election and that US presidential votes in the modern era have not been tainted by fraud. But they can\u2019t seem to do it. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, whom Trump mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender on Thursday, said on CNN the same night, \u201cI will accept the results if it\u2019s done in a fair and transparent way,\u201d going on to raise doubts about mail-in voting. Also on CNN Thursday night, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds \u2014 who\u2019s also been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d accept the results if Trump loses. \u201cIf the states and localities actually follow the rules and procedures and everybody sees the rules followed, then of course, you accept what\u2019s done,\u201d Donalds said. Earlier this week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in 2016 but has since adopted Trumpian positions, was asked Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether he would accept the result of the election \u201cno matter what happens.\u201d He replied: \u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested by either side.\u201d He claimed that Democrats have \u201copposed every Republican victory since 2000\u201d and added: \u201cIf it\u2019s unfair, we are going to do the same thing Democrats do \u2026 we\u2019re going to use lawyers to go to court and point out the fact that states are not following their own election laws.\u201d Rubio\u2019s comment is misleading because, while there were some claims by small groups of Democrats that the elections of 2004 and 2016 featured some fraud, the Democratic candidates in each case quickly conceded to Republicans,\u00a0unlike Trump, who has never accepted that he lost. The 2000 election was contested by Republicans and Democrats over a recount controversy in Florida, the pivotal state. The Democratic candidate,\u00a0then-Vice President\u00a0Al Gore, eventually conceded after the case was adjudicated by the Supreme Court \u2014 a step that Trump never took as he sought to disrupt the American tradition of peaceful transfers of power. The idea that the 2024 election may not be free and fair was also raised recently by Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance,\u00a0who is reported to be on Trump\u2019s shortlist as a potential vice presidential nominee. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier this month that \u201cI totally plan to accept the results of 2024,\u201d while holding out the possibility that the election may not be fair if Trump were to lose. \u201cI think that Donald Trump will be (the victor).\u00a0And if it\u2019s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results. And, again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president, been reelected president.\u201d Vance argued that parties in the election had to be willing to prosecute their cases if they believed there was election fraud. But academic studies and multiple legal cases have shown that fraud in presidential elections only occurs in isolated cases. That\u2019s not stopping Republicans demonstrating their loyalty to Trump by casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election before it even happens.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_biden-trump-campaign-season-analysis", "text": "Labor Day traditionally heralds the final push for presidential campaigns, but a frenetic, compressed calendar this year means the critical marker is the holiday that signals the start of summer rather than the one that marks its end. Monday\u2019s Memorial Day holiday will be a prelude to a bitter season of politics with a neck-and-neck presidential election already looking almost certain to come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states. The heat will be even more intense because the clash between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will for only the second time ever see two presidents each dueling for a second term. The unprecedented nature of the 2024 race will be immediately underscored on Tuesday when Trump returns to the Manhattan courtroom where he is facing his first criminal trial. He is accused of falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. (He\u2019s pleaded not guilty and denied the alleged affair with the actress.) After a monthlong trial, lawyers for both sides will crystalize their cases in closing summations before the judge hands the jury the historic task of deciding for the first time whether an ex-president and presumptive nominee will be convicted of a crime. It remains unclear how a conviction or an acquittal would reverberate in a polarized nation during a presidential race that has been remarkably stable with neither candidate able to break away. Would the historic stain of a felony conviction for Trump further alienate the critical suburban swing-state voters who may decide the election? Or has Trump been so successful in spreading his narrative that he\u2019s a victim of politically motivated prosecutions that the impact of a guilty verdict would be neutralized? The former president would almost certainly use an acquittal to argue that his other three criminal indictments are baseless. And with those cases unlikely to come to trial before November\u2019s election, a campaign intertwined with Trump\u2019s legal problems would suddenly look more like a traditional election \u2014 albeit one featuring the most unorthodox ex-president of modern times, who tried to overturn democracy after losing the last election to Biden. As soon as the verdict is announced in New York, attention will switch to the unusually early first presidential debate at the end of June on CNN. Biden, who has been consistently a little behind in swing-state polls, has a strong interest in an earlier-than-usual head-to-head confrontation that could change the momentum in the race. The president also wants Americans to tune into Trump\u2019s wild, anti-democratic personality and focus on how extreme a second term that his rival has said he\u2019d devote to retribution would be. While presidential debates have traditionally been in the fall, the growing prevalence of early and mail-in voting is a reason to shift debates earlier. A second presidential debate has been scheduled for September on ABC, and while Trump is pushing for more one-on-one showdowns with Biden, the president\u2019s campaign is resisting his demands. Biden seizes on new abortion controversy to discomfort Trump With the Trump trial on hold ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, Thursday brought a preview of how the rest of the campaign might unfold. Biden argued that a new bill approved by Louisiana lawmakers that would classify abortion-inducing drugs as controlled dangerous substances was a \u201cdirect result of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade.\u201d He was referring to the conservative Supreme Court majority that Trump built that eradicated the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. \u201cThis is a scary time for women across America. If Donald Trump regains power, he will try to make what is happening in states like Louisiana a reality nationwide,\u201d Biden said. Abortion is one of the few issues where polls show Biden enjoys higher public approval than Trump, and Democrats are counting on it driving up their turnout at a moment when there are serious questions about the durability of Biden\u2019s electoral coalition. The former president has waffled on abortion and his latest position that decisions on the issue should be left to the states does little to protect him politically every time a conservative state or judge takes a hardline anti-abortion position. Another of the key developments to watch this summer will be whether the ex-president is able to maintain what some polls suggest is an unusually strong position for a Republican among minority voters. Biden is taking urgent steps to shore up his support in communities that usually vote overwhelmingly Democrat. He, for instance, issued two new ads on Thursday implicitly accusing Trump of being a racist, recalling the former president\u2019s call for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of minority teenagers falsely accused of beating and raping a woman in New York\u2019s Central Park in the 1980s. The ads also reminded voters about Trump\u2019s racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. The Trump campaign accused Biden of trying to \u201cgaslight Black voters\u201d and highlighted Biden\u2019s support as a senator for a 1990s crime bill that raised incarceration rates for Black Americans. In what was billed as an attempt to reach out to Black and Hispanic voters, the former president held a rally in the Bronx on Thursday, in a rare visit for a Republican to one of the country\u2019s most Democratic counties. The former president used the opportunity to argue that minorities were suffering because of what he claims is out-of-control migration \u2014 the issue at the core of his campaign. \u201cThese millions and millions of people that are coming into our country, the biggest impact and the biggest negative impact is against our Black population and our Hispanic population, who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s event followed a visit by Biden to Morehouse College \u2014 the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 in Georgia last weekend in which he took implicit aim at Trump and his right-wing supporters, warning that when \u201cold ghosts in new garments seize power, extremists come for the freedoms you thought belonged to you and everyone.\u201d Biden has multiple vulnerabilities Biden also used his Moorehouse speech to try and insulate himself from another of his vulnerabilities heading into the final months of the campaign \u2014 the fury among young and progressive voters about his support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians. \u201cThis is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was working around the clock for a ceasefire and toward the distant prospect of a Palestinian state. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about it. I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family.\u00a0But most of all, I know it breaks your heart.\u00a0It breaks mine as well.\u201d But on Thursday, the president was given a reminder of the backlash against America\u2019s Israel policies with the eruption of another protest like the ones that have rattled college campuses across the country. Demonstrators chanted \u201cdivest now!\u201d as they demanded UCLA pull out of any investments linked to Israel in a largely peaceful protest in Los Angeles. Any large-scale resumption of protests in the run-up to the election, or at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, could play into Trump\u2019s hands as he claims that law and order is spinning out of control under Biden and would raise further questions about the president\u2019s capacity to achieve strong support from younger and more progressive voters. Biden badly needs the war in Gaza to ease over the summer, but there is no sign that Netanyahu is willing to heed his calls for a lowering of the conflict\u2019s intensity. The president will also be hoping this summer for the cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve that he has long predicted would come and that could give some relief to Americans weary of the cost of homes and vehicles and high prices at supermarkets. The financial crunch has hollowed out Biden\u2019s reputation for economic management despite robust growth and low unemployment and offered Trump an advantage on the issue that decides most US elections. The former president has been creating an idealized vision of the economy during his term, before the Covid-19 pandemic caused a crash. \u201cThe costs have gone up so much,\u201d Trump said in the Bronx. \u201cI don\u2019t eat bacon anymore, it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d the billionaire former real estate tycoon said. Inflation has fallen substantially \u2014 to 3.4% year on year last month \u2014 well below 40-year highs after the pandemic. But many Americans have yet to see the impact in their wallets \u2014 one reason why Trump has an advantage on the perennial election question when voters ask themselves whether they are better off than they were four years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/biden-trump-campaign-season-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_politics_biden-memorial-day-address-arlington-national-cemetery", "text": "President Joe Biden on Monday commemorated Memorial Day during remarks at Arlington National Cemetery, where he marked the solemn and personal occasion by thanking those killed while serving their country in the name of democracy around the world. \u201cFreedom has never been guaranteed \u2013 every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many. It matters, our democracy is more than just a system of government. It\u2019s the very soul of America,\u201d Biden told the crowd gathered for his annual Memorial Day Address. The president took the opportunity to honor those killed while serving their country and also thanked veterans, survivors and family members in the audience on Memorial Day. \u201cWe gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor \u2013honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one, literally \u2026 a link in the chain of honor stretching back to our founding days, each one bound by common commitment; not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea unlike any idea in human history: the idea of the United States of America. Today, we bear witness to the price they paid.\u201d The day is also personal for the president. Biden spoke about the death of his son, Beau Biden, from brain cancer that he believes was linked to the toxic burn pits Beau Biden was exposed to during his tour in Iraq. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of Beau Biden\u2019s death. \u201cOur losses are not the same: He didn\u2019t perish in the battlefield, he was a cancer victim from a consequence of being in the Army in Iraq for a year next to a burn pit,\u201d Biden said. \u201cA major in the US Army National Guard living and working, like too many, besides that toxic burn pit. And as it is for so many of you, the pain of his loss is with me every day, as it is with you, still sharp, still clear. But so is the pride I feel at his service, as if I can still hear him saying, \u2018It\u2019s my duty, Dad, it\u2019s my duty.\u2019 Duty \u2013 that was the code my son lived by, the creed all of you live by.\u201d He then pointed to his signing of the 2022 bipartisan PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits to millions of veterans who were exposed to burn pits, which were used to burn waste \u2014 including trash, munitions, hazardous material and chemical compounds \u2014 at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan until about 2010. These massive open-air burn pits often operated at or near military bases and released dangerous toxins into the air that, upon exposure, may have caused short- and long-term health conditions, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. \u201cI\u2019ve long said we have many obligations as a nation. But we only have one truly sacred obligation: To prepare those we send in to battle, to prepare and take care of them and their families when they come home, and when they don\u2019t,\u201d Biden said, before touting other bills helping veterans and their families signed by his administration. Biden was introduced by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who told the audience that while, \u201cOur arms and technology are the envy of the world \u2026 in the end, America\u2019s greatest strategic asset will always be our people.\u201d \u201cSo, let us always remember our fallen heroes \u2013 let us always strive to defend the democracy for which they fought and died. They did their duty, and we must too,\u201d Austin said. Before giving his annual Memorial Day Address, Biden participated in a wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and in the morning\u00a0hosted a breakfast in honor of Memorial Day with administration officials, military leadership, veterans and Gold Star family members. The president\u2019s remarks come just two days after he delivered the commencement address at West Point, where he pointed to the United States\u2019 role \u201cas the indispensable nation, the world\u2019s only superpower, and the leading democracy in the world.\u201d \u201cFrom the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America,\u201d Biden told the graduating cadets. \u201cEvery generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it.\u00a0Now, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d It also comes as Biden prepares to travel to Normandy, France, in two weeks, where he\u2019s slated to mark the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day where service members \u201cstormed the beaches of Normandy and liberated a continent and literally saved the world,\u201d he said Monday. The speech comes at the beginning of what is expected to be a busy period of campaigning ahead of the November election. Biden\u2019s opponent in that race, former President Donald Trump, marked Memorial Day in a Truth Social post in which he attacked E. Jean Carroll and the judges who have presided over his defamation, civil fraud and criminal hush money trials. \u201cHappy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\u201d Trump said in the lengthy social media rant.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/politics/biden-memorial-day-address-arlington-national-cemetery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_democrats-immigration-border-security-elections", "text": "Laura Grant has been keeping tabs on what Congress has done \u2013 or not done \u2013 to overhaul US immigration and border policy. The 47-year-old insurance agent said she\u2019s concerned about the deteriorating situation at the border.\u00a0The Phoenix resident\u00a0wants a more streamlined process for migrants but said she doesn\u2019t trust either party to solve the issue. Democrats didn\u2019t seem to grasp the severity of the situation, she said. And Republicans rejected a bipartisan border security bill she supported. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what their agenda is anymore,\u201d Grant told CNN during a recent interview at her home\u00a0here.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re for it. They\u2019re not for it. So we\u2019re just kind of in the middle now.\u201d Ahead of the November election, President Joe Biden and many Democratic campaigns are hoping to chip away at what polls have shown is a Republican\u00a0advantage on immigration, particularly in battleground states such as Arizona. The centerpiece of Democrats\u2019 approach has been the bipartisan border bill.\u00a0In February, Republicans blocked a border deal and foreign aid package\u00a0despite\u00a0demanding last year that Democrats pair border security with Ukraine aid. The border security legislation, which failed for a second time in the Senate last week in a vote GOP senators called a political stunt, has given Democrats a concrete example to point to as they seek to portray Republicans as unwilling to address the issue. But the strategy, an effort to triangulate between liberal and conservative policies to appeal directly to results-driven voters, has also reignited an ongoing debate within the Democratic coalition over how to address migration and the border. Democratic campaigns, which have mostly been on defense on immigration policy\u00a0since Donald Trump entered the political scene, have pointed to New York Rep. Tom Suozzi\u2019s February special election win as a sign that campaigning on border security as well as legal pathways for migration is a winning approach for the party.\u00a0Polling has also shown\u00a0voters\u00a0want Congress to pass\u00a0the bipartisan border deal. But some members of the Democratic coalition \u2013 including progressives, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who were excluded from negotiations over the border bill and migrant advocacy groups in swing states \u2013 have warned that Democrats need to emphasize pro-immigrant policies to draw a clear contrast with Republicans.\u00a0They have argued for a course correction from the party and a bigger push toward work permits for long-term residents. Both sides of the debate argue their approach is key to helping Biden win, particularly in swing states like Arizona, where immigration is top of mind for voters and polling has shown Biden trailing Trump. Alejandra Gomez, the executive director of Living United for Change in AZ, or LUCHA, said it would be difficult for her organization\u2019s canvassers to talk to voters about Biden\u2019s immigration policies. For now, the organization is focusing on down ballot races and local issues. But Gomez also framed the\u00a02024\u00a0election as a binary choice. \u201cThere is accountability that has to happen, but that accountability won\u2019t exist under a Trump administration,\u201d she said. Grant, who was visited by a LUCHA canvasser knocking on doors for US House candidate Raquel Ter\u00e1n on a recent Friday, said she would ultimately vote for Biden because of his stance on abortion rights. Arizona lawmakers recently repealed a near-total abortion ban and advocates are gathering signatures for a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights in the state Constitution. Damon, a 57-year-old Phoenix resident and Department of Veterans Affairs employee who declined to give his last name, also cited abortion as a reason he plans to vote for Biden in an interview after a visit from a LUCHA canvasser. But he said he felt Biden had waited too long into his presidency to take action on the border. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to cut right to the chase here, I think he lost the election for us already,\u201d he said. A binary choice Ahead of next month\u2019s first presidential debate, mainstream Democrats are doubling down on\u00a0a\u00a0border security-focused strategy and the effort to shift blame to Republicans. \u201cTrump killed it \u2013 not once, but twice,\u201d Biden campaign spokeswoman Fabiola Rodriguez said in a statement to CNN after Thursday\u2019s vote. A recent memo from House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm said candidates would go \u201con the offensive against disingenuous far-right political attacks from Republicans\u201d on border policy. House Republicans have said the bipartisan border proposal doesn\u2019t go far enough but have also signaled a reluctance to grant Biden an election year victory. Trump said earlier this year that a border deal now would be a political \u201cgift\u201d for Democrats. The White House is considering other options to display a tougher stance on migration, including sending Biden to visit the border and issuing a new executive order limiting asylum claims,\u00a0CNN reported earlier this month. \u201cWhat the average American wants, including the average Latino, is a well secured and well managed border,\u201d said Matt Barreto, a pollster who focuses on\u00a0Latino voters\u00a0and who worked with Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Those same voters also support Democratic immigration priorities such as permanent legal status for Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children, Barreto said, adding that he expects the president\u2019s campaign to focus on those policies ahead of the election. For now, calling Republicans on their bluff is also a winning issue, Barreto said. \u201cI think part of the political strategy is, you\u2019ve got the Republicans cornered on the border,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why not keep talking about it?\u201d California Rep. Robert Garcia, a national advisory board member for Biden\u2019s campaign, acknowledged the frustration of immigration advocates but argued that Trump presents the \u201cworst possible choice.\u201d Trump has proposed swift and severe changes to the immigration system, including increasing the number of ideological screenings, expanding the ban to travel from predominantly Muslim countries and ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants (which many legal observers believe is unconstitutional and likely implausible). He has also promised to launch the \u201clargest domestic deportation operation in American history.\u201d Trump has coined the term \u201cBiden Migrant Crime\u201d as he and other Republicans highlight crimes committed by migrants to falsely argue that migrants have fueled a crime wave. The bipartisan border bill,\u00a0introduced in February, was designed to appease Republicans who said they wouldn\u2019t approve foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel without a border security component. The legislation would have sped up the asylum process and expanded the president\u2019s ability to limit migrant crossings at the US-Mexico border. Trump\u00a0came out against the deal before it was introduced, dooming the initial vote. On Thursday, Senate Democrats\u2019 second attempt to pass the bill failed by an even larger margin \u2013 43-50 \u2013 and lost the backing of two of the key negotiators,\u00a0independent\u00a0Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. \u201cToday is not a bill. Today is a prop,\u201d Lankford said ahead of the vote. Finding middle ground For months, polls have shown immigration and the border as a top issue for voters, behind the economy and inflation. A\u00a0CBS News/YouGov poll released this month\u00a0found that 61% of likely Arizona voters said the US-Mexico border was a major factor in how they would vote, compared with 82% who pointed to\u00a0the economy\u00a0and 78% who\u00a0named\u00a0inflation. Trump led Biden in the poll by 5 points. Among registered voters, 68% said they did not think the Biden administration\u00a0was\u00a0taking steps to reduce the number of migrants crossing into the US. Asked how recent immigrants from Mexico and Latin America had shaped life in Arizona, 52% said they\u2019d made life worse, 13% said they\u2019d made life better and 35% said they saw no impact. To address those divides, Democrats \u2013 from the Biden campaign down to Senate and House Democrats\u2019 campaign arms \u2013 have tried to find a middle ground. Biden has\u00a0frequently referred to the bipartisan border bill as the \u201ctoughest\u201d set of reforms in decades. But he has highlighted his efforts to push comprehensive immigration reform in the first days of his presidency at Democratic campaign events. Allies\u00a0also\u00a0note that even the border security bill\u00a0contains\u00a0pro-immigrant policies, including a pathway to citizenship for Afghans; 250,000 new green cards, raising the cap for the first time in more than 30 years; relief for children who came to the US on a parent\u2019s work visa; and funding for immigration lawyers for children. Supporters have also pointed to the administration\u2019s efforts to expand protections to migrants through regulations and executive actions,\u00a0including Biden\u2019s broad use of humanitarian parole authority to allow various groups to stay in the country. \u201cThe theory I think that this administration is really operating under is creating lawful pathways so that we have people coming with a visa and not with a smuggler, and that they\u2019re coming for a purpose,\u201d\u00a0said Angela Kelley, a former volunteer with the Biden-Harris transition team and chief adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re coming to work, they\u2019re coming to reunite with a family member, they are coming because they\u2019re seeking protection.\u201d Broken promises Immigrant rights advocates \u2013 and Democratic lawmakers critical of their party\u2019s border-first strategy \u2013 say the risk heading into the fall is that organizers will feel deflated, and some voters will ultimately choose to stay home if Democrats don\u2019t develop a more distinctive message that celebrates the contributions of immigrants and focuses on their positive impact on the economy. They cite a recent projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that GDP will increase by about $7 trillion from 2023 to 2034 and revenues will be greater by about $1 trillion due largely to immigration. \u201cThe Democratic\u00a0Party\u00a0is making it really hard for us to do our job,\u201d Luis Zaldivar, the Georgia state director for CASA in Action, a progressive group that mobilizes voters around immigrant rights issues, told CNN. \u201cThe immigrant voice has not been heard through the process.\u201d Illinois\u00a0Rep. Delia Ramirez,\u00a0a progressive\u00a0who has continued to oppose the border bill,\u00a0says it\u2019s\u00a0not enough to say the former president\u2019s policies would be worse. \u201cI think we have this assumption: Let\u2019s just move to the center and sound more Republican.\u00a0We\u2019ll get people to vote for us,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working. We\u2019re sounding just like the other guy, so what ends up winning is apathy.\u201d The risk is losing voters like Abigail Gutierrez, a 22-year-old EMT from Phoenix who voted for Biden in 2020. Gutierrez told CNN that immigration is her top issue because she\u2019d seen how much federal policies have affected\u00a0her community. She hoped to see something done to help migrants who are already in the country \u201cso people aren\u2019t scared to be here.\u201d Asked about Biden, Gutierrez said she\u2019s not sure if\u00a0she will\u00a0back him again this November. \u201cI just think there were a lot of promises that were made that weren\u2019t kept,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/politics/democrats-immigration-border-security-elections/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The outreach to Libertarians follows weeks of stepped-up attacks by Trump aimed at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose high-profile independent White House bid is increasingly viewed by the former president\u2019s advisers as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy addressed the convention Friday as the two directly compete for voters disenchanted by the two-party system. In a speech last weekend to the National Rifle Association, Trump described Kennedy\u2019s political views as \u201cradical left\u201d and warned his supporters, \u201cWe can\u2019t waste any more votes.\u201d In a candid moment, Trump also shared the purpose behind his unusual visit to the Libertarian Party. \u201cWe have to join with (Libertarians) because they get their 3% every year, no matter who\u2019s running,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand we have to get that 3% because we can\u2019t take a chance on Joe Biden winning.\u201d Eight years ago, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson earned more than 3% of the popular vote \u2013 a high point in the party\u2019s history. The number of votes Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein and other third-party contenders earned was larger than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in a handful of closely contested battlegrounds. While Trump\u2019s campaign has downplayed Kennedy\u2019s potential to alter the outcome of the race \u2013\u00a0one adviser called him \u201ca problem, not a threat\u201d \u2013 it is not a risk the former president\u2019s team is willing to write off either. Johnson, a former GOP governor of New Mexico, told CNN that any third-party concerns by Trump or Biden would be misguided. \u201cIf there were no third-party candidates, 50% of their vote would go to Biden, 50% would go to Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd a bunch would stay home.\u201d An unusual invitation and a PR boon The decision to host Trump and Kennedy has brought outsize media attention to the Libertarian Party at a time when it has struggled to maintain its relevance. Four years after Johnson\u2019s historic finish, the party\u2019s candidate earned fewer than 2 million votes and wasn\u2019t a factor in Biden\u2019s victory. Convention organizers believe Trump\u2019s speech marks the first time in the modern political era that a presumptive Republican or Democratic nominee will speak at a third-party convention. Trump appeared eager for the audience. His campaign accepted the invite within 48 hours of the offer, said Angela McArdle, chairwoman of the Libertarian Party. Biden was also asked to speak but didn\u2019t respond. Kennedy has challenged Trump to debate him at the convention, a request that has gone unanswered. \u201cI\u2019ve come pretty close to having a major presidential debate at our national convention,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose. If we don\u2019t get to be in a debate, we\u2019re going to get as close as possible. \u201cWe don\u2019t get the coverage Donald Trump and Joe Biden get. It\u2019s an uphill battle. So this has been a real PR boost.\u201d Still, McArdle and other Libertarian members are skeptical that convention attendees can be seriously moved by Trump\u2019s overtures. \u201cThese are people who spent thousands of dollars and devoted hundreds of hours to be here in support of their Libertarian candidates,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cNo one is worried about them flipping.\u201d Wendy Hamlin traveled from St. Augustine, Florida, to attend the Washington, DC, convention. The 43-year-old joined the Libertarian Party in 2008, and while she said Trump\u2019s appearance marks a \u201chistorical moment\u201d for the party, neither she nor any Libertarian she knows is planning to back him. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see him speak,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone excited to see him because they plan to vote for him.\u201d The test for Trump is not necessarily to convert die-hard Libertarians. Rather, his team hopes to convince independent-minded voters who are considering a third-party candidate out of dissatisfaction with the Democratic and Republican nominees or to push back against the status quo. Phil Anderson, a Libertarian running for Senate in the closely watched battleground of Wisconsin, said he\u2019s seen no evidence of the Trump campaign reaching out to Libertarian-leaning voters in his state. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening in Wisconsin because I know all the Libertarians here in one way or another,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing or hearing evidence of that.\u201d Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said the campaign has \u201calready demonstrated effective and solid organizational strength as seen in the historic quickness and size of our primary wins and the historic polling numbers in the general.\u201d \u201cWe are reaching out to Libertarians, Republicans, independents and everyone in between,\u201d Hughes said. Trump is waging a similar \u2013 and more urgent \u2013 battle to convert Kennedy-curious voters. Kennedy\u2019s support in national surveys has reached double digits \u2013 at 16% in a CNN poll conducted last month by SSRS \u2013 with strong indications that he is siphoning support from both Trump and Biden. As the threat has crystalized, so have Trump\u2019s attacks on Kennedy. The former president now regularly attacks Kennedy in public remarks and on social media. Earlier this month, Trump released a lengthy video that labeled Kennedy a \u201cDemocrat plant.\u201d Trump last weekend touched on some kinship between Libertarians and Republicans that could make for a sensible alliance. Libertarians align with conservatives \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 over a desire for a more limited federal government, lower taxes and less spending but often disagree with Republicans on LGBTQ rights and marijuana policy. \u201cThey are also people of common sense, generally speaking,\u201d Trump said, though he added that Libertarians \u201chave a couple of things that are a little different.\u201d Johnson doesn\u2019t see much overlap between his party and modern Republicans, including Trump. He cited the massive growth in the national debt and government spending under Trump and the Covid-19 lockdown measures of 2020. \u201cBottom line, I didn\u2019t vote for Ronald Reagan the second time because he just blew the lid off the deficit. And that\u2019s Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are going to be some things that he has says that the crowd will be receptive to, but there are a lot of things that just don\u2019t fit.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s little overlap between Trump\u2019s agenda and the topics convention attendees indicated are a priority in the party\u2019s poll. The top choices included elimination of the federal income tax, ending the Federal Reserve and freeing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The poll is not scientific but was open only to convention attendees and party members who paid\u00a0$10 to participate. The Trump campaign is aware the former president may receive an unfriendly reception from some attendees Saturday night but is arguing such a reaction is a byproduct of being \u201con offense and competing for nontraditional votes.\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN, \u201cDo we know that it\u2019s not exactly home base? Absolutely. There will be people who want him to be there and people who don\u2019t want him to be there, but we\u2019re on offense and competing for nontraditional votes in order to unite the country.\u201d Trump ally and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was loudly booed Friday when he mentioned Trump during his speech to the convention. The reaction suggests when Trump takes the stage Saturday night, he will be speaking to a crowd far different from the kind he is used to addressing at his rallies, which are full of adoring fans who wait in line for hours to see him D\u2019Anne Welch, 73, has supported Libertarians since 1990, but she\u2019s worried about the party\u2019s embrace of Trump. She\u2019s considering voting for Biden to keep Trump from winning in November. She and her friends, a group of like-minded Libertarians from Texas, brought noisemakers to Washington in hopes of disrupting Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cHe never should\u2019ve been invited,\u201d Welch said. Competition for Libertarian votes Trump is not alone in courting potential Libertarian voters. Though Kennedy has ruled out the possibility of running on the Libertarian ticket, he has courted party officials dating to before he left the Democratic primary last fall to run as an independent. He met with McArdle in July in Tennessee, where the two discussed shared beliefs, including opposition to vaccine mandates and public health restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy and McArdle met again privately following his appearance at the California Libertarian Party\u2019s state convention in February. The Libertarian ticket was seen as a possible pathway for Kennedy to circumvent ballot access hurdles and take advantage of the party\u2019s access to ballots in dozens of states. Kennedy is on the ballot in six states so far, compared with 38 states for the Libertarians. In his remarks at the California convention, Kennedy argued for the benefits of environmental protection while railing against social media censorship and the \u201ctotalitarian control\u201d exerted by government during the Covid-19 pandemic. He did not mention Trump by name. Yet his appearance at the California convention did little to help him gain traction with party members. In an unofficial straw poll of 95 delegates taken at the convention, Kennedy received just one vote. In April, he told ABC News he had ruled out running on the Libertarian ticket. In recent weeks, Kennedy has ramped up his attacks on Trump, including on his handling of the pandemic. Last weekend, Kennedy\u2019s campaign began selling shirts on its website that read \u201cVote Trump/Fauci 2024\u201d along with the slogan \u201cGive us another shot!,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s prominent role in the Trump administration\u2019s Covid-19 response. Kennedy, a staunch anti-war advocate who has said he opposes sending US aid to assist Ukraine\u2019s war effort, has also accused Trump of backing additional aid to Ukraine. \u201c(Trump) gave a big bear hug to Speaker (Mike) Johnson and President Biden and they agreed to send $64 billion more over to Ukraine. Wouldn\u2019t you rather that 64 billion be spent here in the United States?\u201d Kennedy told supporters during a rally in Austin, Texas, earlier this month. Following a campaign rally in Colorado on Sunday, Kennedy told CNN he thinks Libertarians will agree with his views on the environment, foreign policy and Covid-19. \u201cI think a lot of my philosophy and my approach, particularly environmental issues over the many years, my approach is a free-market approach, which appeals to Libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against war, which I think is another important issue for Libertarians. I support constitutional rights. President Trump dismantled our constitutional rights during Covid. So I think Libertarians are probably more inclined to support me if they follow their philosophies.\u201d During his remarks at the convention on Friday, Kennedy issued sharp criticisms of Trump and Biden, but put particular focus on attacking Trump, who he blamed for enacting public health restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWith the lockdowns, the mask mandates, the travel restrictions, President Trump presided over the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known,\u201d Kennedy said. Marcus Schuff, a 42-year-old from Temecula, California, said he\u2019s likely going to vote Libertarian in 2024, depending on who wins the presidential nomination this weekend. But if not, he said he\u2019d be most likely to support Kennedy over any other candidate, including Trump. He doesn\u2019t approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic or his foreign policy record. \u201cThe way Trump behaved during the Covid lockdowns, you know, he shut down international trade. He didn\u2019t do anything to keep things open when certain governors of certain states were shutting things down. And his foreign policy wasn\u2019t great either. I don\u2019t think we should be assassinating Iranian generals in Iraq,\u201d Schuff said, referring to the 2020 drone strike ordered by Trump that killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think many Libertarians are going to be swayed by Trump,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-family-members-hush-money-trial", "text": "Donald Trump listened to closing arguments on Tuesday surrounded by three of his adult children and some of their spouses \u2013 the largest family gathering in the Manhattan courthouse since the former president\u2019s hush money trial began six weeks ago. However, the display of familial support also drew attention to those conspicuously absent from the family patriarch\u2019s side: his wife and eldest daughter. With a jury verdict potentially days away, Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump have yet to join the former president as he defends himself against 34 charges. Jared Kushner, Ivanka\u2019s husband and a key adviser to Trump during his four years in Washington, hasn\u2019t journeyed to 100 Centre Street for the trial,\u00a0either. Eric Trump, meanwhile, has on several occasions appeared behind his father inside the dingy Manhattan courthouse. Donald Trump Jr., though recovering from knee surgery, has made a few visits as well. On Tuesday, the two were joined by Eric\u2019s wife, Lara, and, for the first time, Trump\u2019s youngest daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, Michael Boulos. During a break in the closing arguments, Trump\u2019s eldest sons attacked the credibility of Michael Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s star witness, and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the case against Trump.\u00a0Trump Jr. also took aim at Robert De Niro, who had spoken outside of the courthouse earlier on Tuesday on behalf of President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. De Niro, Trump Jr. said, \u201cneeds attention because it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s cranked out a good movie.\u201d \u201cWe understand that this is a political persecution,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said. \u201cThat was evidenced today, today by the Biden campaign themselves holding a rally here.\u201d Who in the Trump family has and has not popped up in New York is illustrative of their approaches to the spotlight generated by his third White House bid. While the Trump children overall are not nearly as involved as they were in his previous campaigns, Eric\u00a0Trump\u00a0has attended campaign events and legal proceedings in another case.\u00a0Trump\u00a0Jr. has made select appearances on the campaign trail and hosts a regular Rumble\u00a0TV\u00a0show where he touts his father\u2019s policies and interviews some of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters. Lara Trump remains deeply involved in the former president\u2019s political operation and was recently installed as the co-chair of the Republican National Committee after the previous party leader, Ronna McDaniel, lost the confidence of the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Melania\u00a0Trump,\u00a0though, has not appeared alongside her husband at a single Trump rally and rarely joins him in public. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond when asked if she intends to accompany him for any of the final days of his trial. Sources familiar with the dynamic said it was unsurprising that the former first lady had not been present nor that she hasn\u2019t commented on the allegations central to the case. Trump is accused of illegally orchestrating payments to silence Stormy Daniels, a porn star who told jurors she had a sexual encounter with the former president a year into his marriage with Melania Trump. The initial reports of this alleged encounter and the subsequent payments published while Trump was in the White House embarrassed\u00a0the then-first lady\u00a0and put stress on their marriage. During the trial, jurors also heard testimony related to another alleged mistress, Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal, who has publicly claimed an eight-month affair with Trump overlapping with Melania\u00a0Trump\u2019s pregnancy with their son Barron. Ivanka Trump\u2019s absence from the Manhattan trial is not surprising to many close to the former president after she and Kushner\u2019s public distancing from Trump\u2019s latest presidential campaign.\u00a0A\u00a0source close to the campaign didn\u2019t rule out the couple making a joint appearance before the verdict.\u00a0Both served as senior advisers during his presidency, but Ivanka\u00a0Trump\u00a0announced she would not be involved in the 2024 campaign, citing a desire to focus on her family. \u201cI love my father very much,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\u201d One source in Trump\u2019s orbit noted that Ivanka had specific concerns about her kids\u2019 awareness of the intense limelight from their famous grandfather. \u201cWhen [Ivanka Trump] was at the White House, her\u00a0kids\u00a0were still at the age where they might not know exactly what was going on,\u201d the source said. \u201cHer kids are older now and that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d Several sources indicated that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner\u00a0were given a cold shoulder in some social circles after their time in the White House, after facing backlash from friends over her father\u2019s policies and demeanor while in office. After leaving Washington, the couple left New York and moved to Florida. Kushner\u2019s parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner,\u00a0were co-hosts of a New York fundraiser arranged by billionaire Howard Lutnick during the trial. Trump at the end of his presidency pardoned Charles Kushner,\u00a0 a real estate developer who served prison time in the mid-2000s after he pleaded guilty to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness \u2013 his brother-in-law \u2013 and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission. Trump has at times lashed out at the isolation brought on by his court appearances, both privately and publicly complaining early on that his allies had not made their presence felt inside and outside the court room. Republican lawmakers,\u00a0potential vice presidential contenders, donors and allies responded by flocking to the Manhattan courtroom in droves, sparking daily intrigue over who might show up to defend him. Eric Trump became the first family member to attend the trial. He sat behind his father on the ninth day as a witness laid out the paper trail allegedly connecting Trump to a payment to Daniels. On Tuesday, Eric\u00a0Trump\u00a0apologized to the jury while defending his father. \u201cThis has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_elections-uk-mexico-what-matters", "text": "A large portion of Americans think the US government needs major, systemic reform \u2014 at least according to some polling \u2014 so it\u2019s worth looking at how other countries are doing things. Where are elections not never-ending? Anyone struggling to maintain interest in the never-ending, yearslong focus on the American presidential election might look with envy at the United Kingdom. Voters there only learned Wednesday they\u2019ll have an election in July, when rain-soaked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gambled by announcing a snap general election for July 4. No months of primaries. No party conventions. Everyone knew something was coming \u2014 Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party had until next January to call the election, and it seems like an excessive period since the last UK-wide election in December 2019 \u2014 but clearly the campaign portion will be truncated. Sunak and his party have six weeks to make up a steep deficit in the polls or at least hope to block an outright majority for the Labour Party. RELATED: 7 questions you might have about the UK\u2019s snap July general election British voters won\u2019t directly pick a prime minister. Instead, they\u2019ll select members of Parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority automatically becomes prime minister, and he or she assembles a government around them. It would be as if US House Speaker Mike Johnson appointed fellow lawmakers to run portions of the federal government. It can be a messy system, such as when the ruling Conservative Party churned through a series of prime ministers in recent years without having to get any input from voters. In contrast, India, which is the world\u2019s largest democracy and which, like the UK, has a parliamentary system of government, conducts its election over the course of many weeks. Results will be announced on June 4. CNN\u2019s Will Ripley was recently out on the campaign trail with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is vying for a third consecutive term. Modi\u2019s international reputation has morphed in those years from that of a reformer to that of a divisive nationalist, vilifying the country\u2019s Muslims in his bid to keep power. Where are they choosing between 2 younger women instead of 2 old men? Anyone struggling to find inspiration in the rematch of two senior citizens vying for the US presidency might look with some envy at Mexico, where the government bears many similarities to the US but where the president can only serve a single six-year term. That means Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador must step aside despite his relative popularity \u2014 and, at 70, youth \u2014 compared with the US options, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Instead of choosing between two older men, when Mexican voters go to the polls on June 2, they will be choosing between two younger women. L\u00f3pez Obrador endorsed the front-runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate from his Morena Party who previously led the Mexico City government. The candidate for an opposition coalition is Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, a former Mexican senator. Both are 61. There are other candidates, although they have little chance of winning. Tragedy struck the campaign trail Wednesday when a stage collapsed due to heavy winds, killing nine people. It\u2019s a direct election \u2014 no Electoral College \u2014 and the person who gets the most votes wins. Where do judges not have lifetime appointments? Another difference in Mexico is that Supreme Court justices serve a 15-year term instead of the justice-for-life tradition in the US. If the US had term limits, Samuel Alito would be three years off the bench and free to fly whatever flag he wanted at any of his homes. Instead, with no term limits and no binding ethics rules for US Supreme Court justices, there\u2019s nothing to keep Alito from joining opinions related to November\u2019s election. That\u2019s despite the fact that the flags outside his homes suggest he might have some preferences. Does an upside-down flag flown outside his home in Virginia days before \ufeffBiden\u2019s inauguration betray a bias? Does the flying of a flag seen at the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally suggest a friendliness to Christian nationalists? There\u2019s arguably more evidence of a preference in the activism of fellow justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni. Thomas, who was appointed to the bench in 1991 by then-President George H.W. Bush, is more than 30 years into his Supreme Court tenure. Both Thomas and Alito, in their 70s, are younger than both of the men most primary voters for the major political parties have selected to run for president. Where do they overhaul their court systems? If the nature of the US Supreme Court seems immutable and unchangeable, it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no political will to change the system, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. Congress could, in theory, impose term limits on justices. It could also change the number of justices on the court, as it has in the past. There are active campaigns to change the US system, including changing the number of justices and imposing 18-year term limits. But these do not currently have major political momentum. Plus, Republicans rightly feel they will enjoy an advantage with the current system for decades to come. It\u2019s unlikely they would buy into an overhaul. The UK actually overhauled its Supreme Court with a Constitutional Reform Act back in 2005, although a major difference between the UK and the US is that the UK does not technically have a written constitution. There are plenty of cautionary tales out there as well about other forms of government. In Russia and China, where free speech and the press are seriously limited, autocratic leaders have instilled themselves and are looking to widen their worldwide influence. El Salvador had a ban on its president serving two consecutive terms, but a court full of appointees by controversial President Nayib Bukele gave him the power to seek and win reelection in February. That\u2019s not an option in the US, where the 22nd Amendment only allows for a person to serve two four-year presidential terms. Whoever wins in November \u2014 Biden or Trump \u2014 will be unable to run again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/elections-uk-mexico-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_donald-trump-trial-closing-arguments", "text": "When prosecutors make their final pitch Tuesday to New York jurors for why they should convict former President Donald Trump of a slew of business crimes, they\u2019ll face the burdensome task of weaving together weeks of testimony and evidence they say proves Trump committed felonies to help his 2016 presidential campaign. The closing arguments in Trump\u2019s historic hush money criminal case will give prosecutors from District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office an opportunity to explain to the 12 jurors how each witness they called and piece of evidence they presented bolsters their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. That was already going to be a complicated task for a trial that\u2019s been underway since mid-April and frequently featured witnesses going over the dry details of business recordkeeping and other mundane testimony. But prosecutors will have an extra degree of difficulty with a long break ahead of closing arguments, as jurors will have been away from the case since Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of moments during trial where you\u2019re getting a piece of testimony or you\u2019re introducing a document or other exhibit, and the jury is thinking, \u2018Well, how does this fit in?\u2019 That\u2019s unavoidable. It\u2019s your job at closing to weave it all together, and to make it make sense. And so that will be especially the case here because this is a long trial,\u201d said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor. \u201cThis, more than even your typical case, is going to be a closing case,\u201d he added. Former New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said prosecutors will use their closing arguments \u201cto tell the story from the very beginning.\u201d She said that unlike their opening statement, which lasted about 40 minutes, prosecutors\u2019 final remarks in the case could go on for several hours and feature a visual aid like a PowerPoint presentation to help walk the jury back through some of the key evidence. \u201cThe boring is over. The boring part was having them sit down to hear it,\u201d added Villalona, referring to the 12 jurors. \u201cInterestingly enough, the boring part is actually the most important part of the case because the boring part is what gives you the documents. The star witness in this case are the documents, and the documents speak for themselves.\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys will present their closing arguments first on Tuesday, followed by the arguments from prosecutors. Trump\u2019s legal team is expected to focus on the credibility of former Trump attorney Michael\u00a0Cohen, the only prosecution witness to directly tie the former president to the coverup payments, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche will argue that there was no crime and that business documents were not falsified since\u00a0Cohen\u00a0was Trump\u2019s attorney and continued to work for him into 2017, the people said. The former president\u2019s legal team will also dispute this was part of a conspiracy to influence the election. They will steer clear of any arguments about political motivations for bringing this case, but might mention the case is old and let jurors draw their own conclusions. While the lawyers have no time limit, Trump\u2019s legal team thinks three hours is the maximum time a jury wants to listen to a closing argument, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Their timing posture is also part of a strategy to discourage prosecutor Joshua Steinglass from continuing his closing argument into Wednesday morning. Essentially, Trump\u2019s lawyers do not want the lead prosecutor to have another crack at the jury before they retire to deliberate. Essentially, Trump\u2019s lawyers do not want the lead prosecutor to have another crack at the jury before they retire to deliberate. Once both sides finish their arguments, Judge Juan Merchan will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president; then, the jurors will begin their deliberations. The judge has said he expects this to happen on Wednesday. The closing arguments will begin exactly a week after the defense rested its case on Tuesday and more than five weeks after opening statements were delivered and the first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker, took the stand. The prosecution called 20 witnesses over 19 days in court, with their testimony totaling over 50 hours. Many of their witnesses were not household names, though some, including Cohen and adult film actress Stormy Daniels \u2014 whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of the case \u2014 were high-profile figures whose testimony is no doubt seared into jurors\u2019 minds. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.) For its part, Trump\u2019s team called just two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Cohen to represent him in 2018. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree to cover up the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election to Daniels. If convicted, Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years. Blanche is expected to highlight that prosecutors didn\u2019t call former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who is the only other person in the Trump Tower meeting in 2017 where\u00a0Cohen\u00a0said Trump approved the reimbursement plan and monthly check payments; Dylan Howard, a former top editor of the National Enquirer who was involved in all three of the \u201ccatch and kill\u201d deals; nor Keith Schiller, a former bodyguard to Trump, the people said. What prosecutors might argue Prosecutors will likely contend during their closing arguments that each of their witnesses plays a key role in the case, despite their professional rank or proximity to the alleged crimes. They will probably also have to push back against claims by the defense that Cohen, prosecutors\u2019 star witness, undermines their case because of his history of dishonesty, Honig said. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s argument will be that all the evidence interlocks and is corroborated and that you don\u2019t have to rely on any one witness\u2019s word on its own. They will say this is a documents case,\u201d he explained, going on to describe the various accounting documents presented during the trial. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll say, \u2018Michael Cohen\u2019s here to guide you through it, but you don\u2019t need to believe him \u2014 everything he says is backed up\u2019\u201d by evidence and other testimony, Honig said. Joshua Steinglass, who is doing closings for the prosecution, is expected to address the jury for several hours following the defense\u2019s presentation. He is expected to tie together text messages, phone logs, other witnesses\u2019 testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate\u00a0Cohen\u2019s testimony. During the trial, prosecutors walked jurors repeatedly through the\u00a011\u00a0invoices, 12 vouchers and\u00a011\u00a0checks \u2014 the 34 documents that make up the falsified business records charges \u2014 that were used to pay Cohen $420,000 in 2017, money that included the reimbursement for the $130,000 hush money payment \u201cgrossed up\u201d to account for taxes. Prosecutors showed jurors how Cohen sent the Trump Organization monthly invoices for $35,000, which were processed by the Trump company\u2019s controller so checks could be cut. Trump signed nine of the 11 checks. (The other two checks were paid from Trump\u2019s revocable trust and signed by former Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and one of Trump\u2019s sons.) Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who served for a time as a top prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office, said she expects the prosecution to present several themes in their closing arguments, including that most of the people who testified for their case were \u201cTrump witnesses \u2026 who you would expect to be friendly to him.\u201d The other theme, she said, could be: \u201cLook at the kind of people Trump values,\u201d with prosecutors arguing the former president chose to surround himself with people such as Cohen and Pecker, who were doing Trump\u2019s bidding ahead of the 2016 election. \u201cThese are his people, he chose them. And he shouldn\u2019t now get the benefit of, \u2018Because they\u2019re flawed you can\u2019t rely on them,\u2019\u201d prosecutors might argue, Agnifilo said. \u201cAnd even if you do not rely on them,\u201d she said, echoing Honig, \u201cthe third theme is going to be, \u2018You don\u2019t have to, because everything is corroborated either by other witnesses or documents or records or Trump\u2019s own words.\u2019\u201d The length of the trial may not ultimately prove to be much of a challenge for jurors during their deliberations, Villalona said, since they were allowed to jot down notes during the proceedings and will be able to request some parts of the trial be read back to them. \u201cThe good thing about New York is that they could request to have the whole trial read back to them and the judge will do that,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if they forgot something David Pecker said on Day 1 or 2 of the trial, they can have that read back.\u201d She added that any of the exhibits put into evidence could also be sent to the jurors for them to take a closer look as they mull a verdict. Still, the closing arguments from each side will be carefully crafted to win not only a verdict in their favor, but also to mark each attorneys\u2019 place in the historic trial, Villalona mused. \u201cThe prosecution and the defense is going to give the closing argument of their career,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_donald-trump-bronx-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump held a rally Thursday in the Bronx as his campaign looks to make inroads with Hispanic and Black voters ahead of November\u2019s election. The event in one of the most Democratic counties in the country comes days ahead of closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York criminal hush money trial. Trump faces 34 felony counts and has pleaded not guilty. The trial has tethered the former president to New York for much of the past six weeks, but Thursday\u2019s event in Crotona Park in the South Bronx was Trump\u2019s first major campaign rally in the state since his initial presidential run in 2016. Trump has visited a bodega, which was the scene of a fatal stabbing in 2022, a construction site and a fire station in Manhattan since his trial began in mid-April. As he addressed supporters in the park Thursday, Trump dedicated most of his remarks to bashing President Joe Biden, arguing that his rival is \u201cnot getting the job done for the Bronx,\u201d the state of New York or the country. \u201cAfrican Americans are getting slaughtered. Hispanic Americans are getting slaughtered,\u201d Trump said as he argued that they have been negatively impacted by Biden\u2019s border and economic policies. \u201cThese millions and millions of people that are coming into our country, the biggest impact and the biggest negative impact is against our Black population and our Hispanic population who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose,\u201d he said. A Trump campaign official told CNN that several factors, including the former president\u2019s long history of living and working in New York and his efforts to win over minority voters, played into the decision to hold the Bronx rally. The official said that the area\u2019s proximity to Trump\u2019s criminal trial was also a consideration, as was the former president\u2019s desire to \u201cchallenge the status quo\u201d in a state that has long voted for Democrats. Trump has insisted that he has a shot this fall at winning New York, which a Republican presidential nominee has not carried since 1984. The Bronx is a Democratic stronghold, which Trump lost by about 68 points to Biden in 2020. That margin, however, was down from four years earlier, when Hillary Clinton carried the county by 79 points. Trump\u2019s improvement was even greater in the South Bronx, where Thursday\u2019s rally took place. Biden won the election district (or precinct) surrounding Crotona Park by 69 points. Clinton carried the same precinct by more than 90 points in 2016. Trump\u2019s performance in the Bronx in 2020 mirrored his results in other areas where Hispanic voters make up a substantial portion of the electorate. Residents in the South Bronx are mainly Hispanic (64%) and Black (31%), according to the US Census Bureau. Polling this year shows Trump may do even better among Hispanic and Black voters than he did four years ago. Surveys taken since the beginning of April show Biden\u2019s margin among these voters down double digits compared with surveys from the same point in 2020. This is likely part of the reason why the Biden campaign launched two new ads Thursday aimed at highlighting what it called \u201cTrump\u2019s long record of failures and broken promises\u201d to Black Americans. The spots point out that Trump was sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s and charged with discriminating against African Americans; promoted the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US;\u00a0pushed for the death penalty for five minority teenagers who were wrongly accused and convicted of beating and raping a woman in Central Park in the 1980s; and \u201cstood with violent White supremacists\u201d in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The Trump campaign said the ads represented an attempt to \u201cgaslight Black voters.\u201d \u201cWe must not forget that it was Joe Biden who was a key figure in passing the 1994 Crime Bill, which disproportionately harmed Black communities through harsh sentencing laws and increased incarceration rates. Additionally, we cannot overlook that Biden\u2019s policies are driving Black families deeper into poverty and making them less safe,\u201d Janiyah Thomas, the campaign\u2019s Black media director, said in a statement. Several House Republicans from New York said they couldn\u2019t make it to Trump\u2019s event due to changes in the chamber\u2019s voting schedule Thursday. \u201cNew York is in play and we had all planned to be there to greet him and attend this historic event. However, the House schedule changed and we will be voting to ban illegal immigrants from voting in elections and to protect American\u2019s right to financial privacy,\u201d House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, seen as a potential Trump running mate,\u00a0said in a joint statement with seven other lawmakers. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ritchie Torres, who represent parts of the Bronx, blasted the former president ahead of the event. Ocasio-Cortez, in an interview with NY1, called it an \u201cattempt to, I think, trick some of our folks here,\u201d while Torres told The New York Times that Trump was \u201cradioactive\u201d in the Bronx. Trump\u2019s outreach to minority voters also comes as the former president has made stoking fears about undocumented migrants a cornerstone of his campaign. He has regularly made false or misleading claims about illegal immigration and\u00a0used dehumanizing language when referring to migrants.

{"id": "2024_04_13_politics_questions-trump-trial-answered-what-matters", "text": "When CNN asked for your questions about former President Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial \u2013 for his role in hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women who said they had affairs with him \u2013 we got a flood of input. Not all of it was fit to print. But there were a lot of legitimate and very thoughtful questions, which we\u2019ve updated now that the defense and prosecution have both rested and jurors may begin deliberations as soon as May 28. Keep reading for a representative sampling, which helps explain the case, along with context from CNN\u2019s reporters and coverage. Most of the questions come directly from reader submissions, but for others, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of simplifying multiple submissions into one question. Trump, by the way, denies having the affairs and has pleaded not guilty in the case. I went to CNN\u2019s chief legal analyst Laura Coates for the single, most-asked question, which was asked in many ways but boils down to: Could Trump actually go to jail? Coates: If Trump were to be found guilty of all of the counts, he could theoretically be facing more than a decade in prison.\u00a0The 34 felony counts are classified as Class E felonies in New York, the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty for each of those counts is four years; however New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years.\u00a0It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to decide whether those sentences would run concurrently or consecutively. Because the crimes involve nonviolent offenses and Trump does not have a criminal record, the judge could also consider jailing him for a period that is but a fraction of the maximum penalty. Another possibility is that the judge could forego prison entirely and place him on probation with the possibility of incarceration looming over his head if he fails to abide by the conditions set by the judge. If the judge should decide to incarcerate post-conviction, Secret Service would become the elephant in the, well, cell.\u00a0The unprecedented nature of incarcerating a former president would raise questions about how best to ensure equal treatment under the law and security for a former president. Watch Coates\u2019 show weeknights at 11 p.m. ET where she\u2019ll answer a lot more of your questions. I reached out to the Secret Service to ask if they had planned for the potential that Trump could be imprisoned. Not surprisingly, I was told by a spokesman that this is \u201csomething we can not comment on at this time.\u201d But note that as a matter of US law, former presidents and their spouses are afforded lifetime Secret Service protection, unless they decline it. This is ultimately a question of strategy. But testimony in previous proceedings has not gone well for Weisselberg, the former, longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. He is currently indisposed at Rikers Island, a prison in New York, where he\u2019s serving time for admitting to perjury in the civil fraud trial that ended in a more than $400 million judgement against Trump for inflating his net worth to get friendly loan terms. Prosecutors told Judge Juan Merchan they did not attempt to compel Weisselberg\u2019s testimony in this trial even though he played a crucial role in payments to Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen. Defense lawyers said Weisselberg was not available to either side for testimony and would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if called. Look for jurors to be given instructions about how to view testimony they heard about Weisselberg. There is strong evidence that the campaign was in a state of panic after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in 2016. There is strong evidence from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the desire to help Trump\u2019s campaign by finding and neutralizing damaging stories. It\u2019s clear that Cohen organized payments for Stormy Daniels, a woman who claimed an affair with Trump, and that he took out a loan to make them happen. But Cohen is the only witness who said that Trump specifically made payments to Cohen to reimburse him for the payments to Daniels. Jurors will have to believe Cohen, an admitted liar and felon, that the payments were improper reimbursement and not simply lawyer fees. A unanimous vote is required for either conviction or acquittal. Anything short of a unanimous verdict would be a hung jury. The judge will try very hard to get the jury to reach a unanimous verdict.  A hung jury might be perceived as a net win for Trump since prosecutors would have to ponder whether to try him again on the same charges and there\u2019s little chance it would happen before Election Day. The former first lady has not attended any of her husband\u2019s criminal trial, although many of Trump\u2019s political allies \u2013 senators, House members and more \u2013 have shown their support by attending some of the arguments. Trump\u2019s son with Melania, Barron Trump, graduated from high school in Florida during the trial and the judge canceled arguments that day so that the former president could attend the ceremony. Given that the trial included testimony from Daniels about her alleged affair \u2013 which Trump has denied \u2013 it is perhaps not surprising that Melania Trump would decide not to attend the proceedings. First, Trump never signed a check to Daniels, and that is a major element of the case. Cohen engineered the hush money payment when he could not get the National Enquirer to foot the bill. Cohen took out a line of credit on his apartment to come up with the cash. Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen after Trump won the White House were, according to Cohen, to pay him back for the Daniels payments, plus a bonus, and for other things like a bogus poll Cohen engineered. Second, Trump did claim to give up control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., when he was in the White House. But the arrangement was universally criticized by ethics experts. Trump maintained his ownership stake in the business. Some of his payments to Cohen were made from accounts associated with the trust set up to hold the Trump Organization while Trump was president. Other payments were made from a personal bank account, but all the payments were processed by the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors. Trump isn\u2019t technically accused of having an affair, which he denies and which is not illegal. The hush money itself, represented by a contract between two parties, is not necessarily illegal either. Hush money was paid by the Trump-supporting publisher of the National Enquirer to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and, separately, it was paid by Cohen to Daniels. But in this case, the payments, which were intended to hide details from voters before the 2016 election, violated campaign finance law. National Enquirer\u2019s parent company admitted wrongdoing, and Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign law and served time in prison. Federal prosecutors, as a matter of Department of Justice policy, were unable to prosecute Trump for the payments when he was president and decided not to bring charges after he left office. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg then brought this case. Trump is accused of falsifying business records (a New York state crime) in an effort to use illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 campaign (a federal crime). Yes. This is an important element of the case. Falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor. The felony charge here is falsifying business records to further another crime. And this is where the case against Trump gets unique. The other crime is a campaign finance violation to which Cohen has already pleaded guilty. It is a state crime made a felony by furthering a federal crime. Federal prosecutors, by the way, decided not to pursue charges against Trump with regard to the campaign finance violation. Jurors heard testimony about how nervous Trump\u2019s campaign was after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was published and they desperately wanted to tamp down on any unflattering stories. Trump\u2019s defense is that he did not want the Daniels story to be published because he wanted to keep the information from his wife. Nothing about any of this is normal. Trump\u2019s stated legal strategy is to delay legal proceedings as much as possible in the hope that they do not conclude before the presidential election. It\u2019s a strategy that so far is paying off in federal court. His federal election interference case is stalled until the US Supreme Court rules on what most people consider to be a ridiculous total immunity argument. His federal trial on classified documents is on indefinite hold in Miami. His trial in Fulton County, Georgia, on state election interference allegations has been delayed by allegations of impropriety in the personal life of the DA bringing the case. This is a great and essentially unanswerable hypothetical. First, it assumes multiple things will occur: Trump would have to be convicted, sentenced, exhaust appeals, report to prison and win the election. That\u2019s a very specific scenario thrust upon a very unpredictable set of circumstances and a short timeline. I talked to Frank Bowman, a law professor emeritus at the University of Missouri who is both an expert in criminal law and published a book on the impeachment process, for his thoughts on how to deal with a convict president. The Constitution, he said, theoretically allows a person to serve \u201ceven if he\u2019s a convicted felon or even if he\u2019s a convicted felon in the joint.\u201d Timing, however, would get in the way of this hypothetical ever occurring. \u201cThis stuff takes a long time, and the appeals would drag out,\u201d probably beyond Election Day and Inauguration Day, Bowman said. It\u2019s also possible Trump\u2019s opponents, after a conviction, could try again to either impeach him or object to his presidency based on the 14th Amendment, although those avenues have been tried and failed previously. If somehow Trump was convicted in this state case, Bowman imagined there could be some argument by which the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause \u2013 which prohibits states from interfering in the exercise of constitutional powers \u2013 could be utilized to keep Trump from state prison. But it would be a novel thing. If, on the other hand, Trump was somehow convicted in one of his two federal trials and sentenced to federal prison, as president he could theoretically try to pardon himself or order the Bureau of Prisons to do something like confine him at the White House. Again, this is uncharted territory that is unanticipated in US law and, Bowman argues, unlikely to occur.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_biden-campaign-january-6-officers", "text": "The Biden reelection campaign has enlisted three police officers \u2013 all of whom were working at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, when rioters overtook the building \u2013 to stump for Biden across battleground states in the coming weeks, the campaign told CNN. Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, Officer Harry Dunn and Officer Danny Hodges plan to tell voters across key swing states that former President Donald Trump poses a threat to democracy and to their fundamental rights as Americans. Dunn and Gonell sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol and have since retired from the Capitol Police. Hodges continues to serve with DC\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. \u201cWe were the victims, we lived through it,\u201d Dunn, who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Congress, told CNN in an interview. \u201cIf I can tell that story a million times, I will. If I can do that, I\u2019ll just be doing my part to save democracy.\u201d The effort will see the surrogates travel to Nevada and Arizona this week and Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire in the weeks to follow. The campaign expects to hammer the first-person, threat-to-democracy message in the weeks leading up to the first debate between Biden and Trump that is set for June 27 and hosted by CNN. Some of that messaging has already been tested. In a fundraising email to Biden supporters last week, Gonell described sustaining career-ending injuries and being \u201ctrampled in a tunnel\u201d \u2013 and noting he would continue fighting for America after being in uniform. \u201cThat includes doing everything I can to make sure Donald Trump \u2013 the man who calls the January 6 insurrectionists who nearly took my life \u2018patriots\u2019 and literally salutes them, is never elected president again,\u201d the email read. The move underscores a critical pillar of the Biden team\u2019s messaging strategy on the trail and on the debate state in Atlanta: channeling the events of January 6 into a broader argument about Trump\u2019s mental stability \u2013 and goading Trump into an outsized response. \u201cWhen Trump lost the 2020 election, he snapped,\u201d wrote Biden-Harris campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon in a memo released Friday alongside a new ad with the same message. \u201cHe tried desperately to cling to power, and encouraged a violent assault on our nation\u2019s Capitol, cheering on a mob that threatened to hang his own vice president.\u201d The democracy-centric messaging at home will also coincide with a series of democracy-focused summits with international allies, including a trip to France to commemorate the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day, an annual gathering of leaders from the Group of Seven developed democracies and a NATO summit in Washington, DC, that\u2019s expected to be focused on defending Ukraine against Russia.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_dnc-virtual-roll-call-biden-ohio", "text": "The Democratic National Committee is planning to hold a virtual roll call ahead of the party\u2019s August convention to nominate President Joe Biden in order to meet an Ohio ballot access deadline. The move comes after the Republican-controlled Ohio legislature failed to pass legislation to move back the state\u2019s August 7 deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees. The Democratic convention is taking place August 19-22. \u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\u201d DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cBut when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\u201d The\u00a0decision by the DNC\u00a0comes after Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine last week called for a special session starting Tuesday to pass legislation to fix the ballot issue. The DNC\u2019s plans were first reported by the Columbus Dispatch and the Washington Post. A virtual roll call would resolve an ongoing struggle between the Biden campaign and GOP officials in the Buckeye State. Last month, legal counsel for Ohio\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose warned the campaign that the convention, when the party is expected to formally nominate Biden, will occur after the state\u2019s certification deadline. Democrats\u00a0held\u00a0a remote vote before the convention during the pandemic in 2020. Under that process, delegates were sent individualized ballots, with all votes cast and counted before the convention officially began. During the convention, the party played a\u00a0virtual roll call\u00a0which featured videos and live shots from around the country. The party is planning to formally introduce a resolution to allow for a virtual roll call next week, before sending the measure for a vote by the whole committee. In previous cycles, early certification deadlines were resolved without much fanfare. States have either accepted provisional certification from the parties ahead of their conventions or passed legislation to move back the deadline to accommodate late conventions. Earlier this month, Alabama\u2019s Republican-led legislature moved back the deadline to clear the way for Biden to make the ballot there. Officials in Washington, which also has an earlier deadline than most states, said they would accept a provisional certification. Ohio officials declined to accept a provisional certification and efforts to resolve the issue legislatively failed. State lawmakers in Ohio voted to move back the deadline ahead of the 2012 and 2020 party conventions. Holding a virtual roll call is one of several options Democrats weighed to keep Biden on the ballot. While holding part of the convention virtually could distract from the in-person activities, it is less contentious than a possible legal challenge. Legislative efforts failed after Ohio Republicans sought to extract concessions from Democrats. And while Ohio is no longer a presidential swing state \u2013 former President Donald Trump won there in 2020 by 8 points \u2013 Biden\u2019s presence on the ballot could be decisive in down ballot races, including Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s reelection bid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/dnc-virtual-roll-call-biden-ohio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_peter-strzok-lisa-page-fbi-settlement-doj", "text": "Former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page have reached a settlement with the Justice Department after they alleged their privacy rights were violated when their text messages were released and became political fodder for Donald Trump to oppose the Russia investigation during his presidency. The settlement, described as a \u201ctentative agreement\u201d in a court filing on Tuesday, will resolve in full the 5-year-old case Page brought against her former employer. She had sought financial damages of at least $1,000 for alleged privacy violations after her text messages critical of Trump were released to the media. Strzok, who was ultimately fired from the FBI, hasn\u2019t settled the portion of his lawsuit in which he sued for backpay and his job back, the filing said. The settlement has not yet been finalized or approved by a judge. Lawyers for Strzok and Page declined to comment or to provide further detail on the settlement. Strzok in his 2019 lawsuit had accused the Justice Department of wrongfully terminating him because of Trump\u2019s publicly stated anger toward him and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0Strzok played a senior role on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team until he was removed after an internal investigation first revealed his texts with Page, with whom Strzok had an extramarital relationship, that could be read as exhibiting political bias. Page, who had also briefly served on Mueller\u2019s team, resigned from her role as a lawyer for the FBI after the messages were discovered. Page\u2019s suit alleged that \u201cDOJ and/or FBI officials\u201d provided the messages to reporters \u201cfor multiple improper reasons, including to elevate the DOJ\u2019s standing with the President.\u201d It claimed that journalists were brought to the Justice Department \u201cto review the messages at night, prohibiting the reporters from copying or removing the set of messages from the building, and instructing them not to reveal DOJ as the source.\u201d Echoing Page\u2019s suit, Strzok\u2019s lawyers added that the defendants \u201cshould not be heard to complain about the notoriety and putative damage to the FBI\u2019s reputation from Strzok\u2019s speech when it was their own illegal disclosures, magnified and distorted by the false attacks made by the President and his allies, that placed a spotlight on Strzok\u2019s opinions.\u201d The suits also led to Trump being deposed last year after a yearslong back and forth, with the Biden Justice Department seeking to shield Trump from giving the testimony, citing legal protections surrounding presidents and their actions while in office. Strzok\u2019s and Page\u2019s attorneys were able to ask Trump at the time about his public statements and other communications he made about the pair in 2017 and 2018.

While Biden stayed away from mentioning former President Donald Trump or making an appeal to voters ahead of the November election, he drew a sharp contrast with his Republican rival by underscoring values Democrats have suggested are at risk, such as democracy and the NATO alliance. \u201cNothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cEvery\u00a0generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Speaking to the graduating class of cadets, Biden reiterated the US\u2019 support of Ukraine by saying,\u00a0\u201cWe\u00a0are standing strong with Ukraine and we will stand with them.\u201d In response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Biden said NATO was now\u00a0\u201cthe\u00a0greatest defense alliance in the history of the world \u2013 stronger than ever\u201d while praising its newest members, Sweden and Finland. The president\u2019s speech came as he deals with a delicate balancing act over his support for Israel in its war against Hamas, which has roiled college campuses across the country. The speech also followed a commencement address he gave last weekend at Morehouse College in which he appealed to Black voters while also acknowledging the anguish\u00a0simmering among young people over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The president on Saturday praised the US military for its work in building a temporary pier off the shore of Gaza, saying it was built \u201cin record time\u201d and \u201cincreased life-saving aid to the Palestinians.\u201d Aid groups began distributing\u00a0the humanitarian assistance offloaded at the pier to Palestinians this week after\u00a0encountering significant obstacles\u00a0on distribution routes that delayed the deliveries. During the address on Saturday, the president promised he is always\u00a0\u201cwilling\u00a0to use force by fire\u201d to protect the nation, saying that\u00a0\u201cif\u00a0anyone targets American troops we will deliver justice to them.\u201d He cited his ordering of drone strikes against Iranian-backed militants in response to the killing of three US service members in Jordan in January. Biden also spoke on sexual harassment in the military, saying, \u201cEvery\u00a0member of our armed forces must always be safe and respected in the ranks,\u201d before praising the\u00a0reduction of reported incidents\u00a0of sexual assault and harassment in the military. \u201cFor the first time in nearly a decade, rates of sexual assault and sexual harassment have gone down across the active-duty forces,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0long past time to end the scourge of sexual violence in the military once and for all, and we can do this.\u201d CNN\u2019s Avery Lotz and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/politics/biden-west-point-commencement-address/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_rafah-camp-attack-biden-israel-support", "text": "President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel following a deadly strike that resulted in the death of more than 45 people, the White House said Tuesday, suggesting the incident had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support. Instead, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US would look for answers from Israel following the country\u2019s investigation of the incident, which he described as \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d \u201cAs a result of this strike on Sunday, I have no policy changes to speak to. It just happened,\u201d Kirby told reporters at the White House. \u201cThe Israelis are going to investigate it. We\u2019re going to be taking great interest in what they find in that investigation. And we\u2019ll see where it goes from there.\u201d It was the clearest indication yet that Biden has not yet reached the point where he would consider suspending arms shipments or other aid to Israel, despite saying in a CNN interview earlier this month he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. While Kirby called on Israel to take precautions to protect civilian lives and warned there was a danger in Israel becoming more isolated from its traditional allies, he asserted there were no indications yet that it had waged a military campaign that would prompt Biden to withhold aid or weapons. Israeli tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time in Israel\u2019s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase of its offensive as Israel presses on despite mounting international pressure. Over the weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a displacement camp in the southern Gaza city, killing dozens and sparking global outrage. The strike also took out two Hamas leaders, Israel said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cThe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris said of the incident on Tuesday, declining to answer when questioned about whether it crossed a red line. Still, Kirby said Israel\u2019s actions in the southern Gaza city have thus far not amounted to such a major ground operation, defining such a scenario as thousands of troops entering the locale. \u201cShould that occur, then it might make him have to make different decisions in terms of support. We haven\u2019t seen that happen at this point,\u201d Kirby said. Biden has not commented publicly on either development but has been kept appraised of actions inside Israel over the weekend, Kirby said. The US response has stood in sharp contrast to leaders in Europe and elsewhere, who sharply condemned Israel\u2019s actions and called for an end to the violence in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the strikes and called on operations in Rafah to stop. \u201cThere are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cI call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.\u201d In a news conference on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Israel is looking into the possibility that the Sunday strike may have unintentionally set off possible stored\u00a0weapons\u00a0in a nearby compound and subsequently a large fire that decimated the tented displacement camp. Kirby suggested the US would look to Israel\u2019s assessment of the incident as it gauges a path forward. \u201cWe aren\u2019t on the ground. We aren\u2019t flying the aircraft. We\u2019re not choosing the targets. We\u2019re not providing the intelligence that leads to every target that Israeli society to hit. It is their operation,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir troops involved, their capabilities, their pilots, they have the obligation to investigate this themselves and they\u2019ll do that, and we will take a look and see what it says.\u201d The United\u00a0States \u201cwill be watching\u201d the results of the Israeli investigation into the deadly strike and subsequent fire in\u00a0Rafah\u00a0\u201cclosely,\u201d\u00a0State\u00a0Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday, saying that the findings should be \u201cpresented openly and transparently to us and to the world.\u201d \u201cAs soon as the United\u00a0States saw reports of this incident, we reached out to the Government of Israel to express our deep concern over what happened, ask for more information and urge them to undertake a full investigation,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/rafah-camp-attack-biden-israel-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_biden-campaign-trump-trial", "text": "After months of either ignoring or poking fun at former President Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial, the Biden campaign on Tuesday decided for the first time to stage a news conference about Trump\u2019s record outside the courthouse where closing arguments were taking place. The feisty event, which featured a surprise appearance from actor-turned-campaign-surrogate Robert De Niro, was not specifically intended to discuss aspects of the trial, the president\u2019s team insisted. But it was undoubtedly meant to draw attention to the criminal defendant inside the nearby building. \u201cIf Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted,\u201d De Niro said, with chanting protesters and a car alarm blaring in the background. \u201cAnd elections \u2014 forget about it, that\u2019s all. That\u2019s done, if he gets in, I can tell you right now \u2014 he will never leave. He will never leave.\u201d Previously, Biden\u2019s team had been wary of doing or saying anything that might appear to politicize the former president\u2019s trial.\u00a0In their view, Trump\u2019s trial would speak for itself, reintroducing the former president and the chaos that surrounds him to voters who may have tuned him out. Some of Biden\u2019s allies had questioned that notion, however, suggesting Trump had already done plenty to politicize his legal issues and that Biden \u2014 if he wanted to capture voters\u2019 attention \u2014 would be wise to weigh in as well. Tuesday\u2019s event amounted to a nod to the second approach. \u201cThe entire news media is camped out here, day in and day out,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler said, explaining the choice to address reporters outside the lower Manhattan courthouse. Aside from De Niro, who recently narrated an ad slamming Trump, two police offers who were present at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and attacked by pro-Trump rioters were featured:\u00a0Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn. \u201cAt the end of the day, this election is about Donald Trump and his vision for the office of the president of the United States \u2014 not as a public servant who answers to the elected \u2014 to the people who elected him, but as an authoritarian, who answers to, and serves only, himself,\u201d Fanone said. Top Trump advisers Jason Miller, Steven Cheung and Karoline Leavitt spoke to reporters immediately after the news conference. Miller bashed the two-time Oscar winner. \u201cThe best they can do is roll out a washed up actor,\u201d Miller said. He echoed Trump\u2019s attacks on Judge Juan Merchan as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cconflicted,\u201d and continued to argue the case was \u201ccomplete garbage.\u201d The president\u2019s team sees an opening once the trial concludes to become more aggressive in their framing of Trump as a threat to democracy, all leading up to the CNN debate on June 27. On everything from the ads the campaign runs to the messaging and rhetoric that comes from the president himself to growing the campaign\u2019s infrastructure, a person familiar with the campaign\u2019s thinking said, the Biden team recognizes that once the Trump trial \u2014 and the aggressive media coverage of it \u2014 is over, there will be more room and opportunities to make their case to the American people ahead of November. Biden campaign officials are still grappling with the reality, this person said, that a substantial part of the population still doesn\u2019t see that the choice on Election Day will be between Biden and Trump. And while the campaign will need to calibrate its messaging and strategy based on how exactly Trump\u2019s trial ends, this person insisted that at the end of the day, the thrust of their case against the former president won\u2019t change \u2014 whether Trump emerges a convicted felon or not. De Niro presented the main theme of that messaging on Tuesday. He blasted the former president as \u201ca tyrant\u201d and \u201ca coward,\u201d telling reporters that as New Yorkers, they tolerated the former real estate mogul as \u201cjust another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids.\u201d And he said that the stakes of November\u2019s election are what prompted him to join the campaign for a new ad released last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden-Harris ad, because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he\u2019d use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed,\u201d De Niro said. \u201cYou think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one? This guy ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside \u2014 no way. He doesn\u2019t get blood on his hands. No, he doesn\u2019t. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him.\u201d As CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0on Friday, the Biden campaign effectively launched the start of that next phase by releasing a scorching new ad called \u201cSnapped,\u201d narrated by Niro. \u201cWe knew Trump was out of control when he was president,\u201d De Niro says over a shot of Trump behind the Resolute Desk. \u201cThen he lost the 2020 election and snapped.\u201d The ad describes Trump as \u201cdesperately\u201d trying to cling to power while showing images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The phrases \u201cdictator\u201d and \u201cterminate the Constitution\u201d flash on screen, followed by a clip of Trump saying, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath.\u201d Fanone, a former Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Officer who was attacked during the January 6 insurrection, said that he was \u201cjust one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump\u2019s supporters inspired by his lies, the lies that continue to this day to inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans, to turn against police officers.\u201d Dunn, a former US Capitol Police officer, called Trump \u201cthe greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today.\u201d \u201cHe has encouraged and continues to encourage political violence. We\u2019ve been called traitors \u2013 just today. We were all called traitors on January 6, for doing our job,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cPolitical violence is never acceptable, but you have a presidential candidate that champions it, that encourages it, that supports it. We cannot have that.\u201d Earlier Tuesday, Biden\u2019s reelection campaign said it was enlisting police officers working at the US Capitol on January 6 to stump for Biden across battleground states in the coming weeks. Sgt. Aquilino Gonell and officer Danny Hodges also plan to join Dunn in telling voters that Trump poses a threat to democracy and to their fundamental rights as Americans. Dunn and Gonell sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol and have since retired from the Capitol Police. Hodges continues to serve with DC\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.

A series of appeals challenging Florida\u2019s use of six-member juries has been pending at the Supreme Court for months. Six states \u2014 Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Utah \u2014 allow six- or eight-member juries to decide felony cases. The criminal defendants asserted that the practice violates the 6th Amendment. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a dissent from the decision to deny the cases. \u201cIf there are not yet four votes on this court to take up the question,\u201d Gorsuch wrote, \u201cI can only hope someday there will be.\u201d  \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d Gorsuch wrote, \u201cnothing prevents the people of Florida and other affected states from revising their jury practices to ensure no government in this country may send a person to prison without the unanimous assent of 12 of his peers.\u201d Florida officials told the Supreme Court the state has been using six-member juries since 1877. And they said that roughly 5,000 criminal convictions were pending on appeal because of the issue. \u201cFor nearly as long as states have had a Sixth Amendment duty to provide criminal jury trials, this court\u2019s message to the people of Florida has been clear: the jury structure that they have settled on for a century and a half fulfills that duty,\u201d state officials\u00a0 told the Supreme Court. Four years ago, in a case called Ramos v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court banned the use of non-unanimous juries for felonies that had been the practice in Louisiana and Oregon. The defendants said the practice in Florida has its roots in the Jim Crow-era and a desire to prevent Black Americans from serving on juries. The Supreme Court declined a similar appeal in 2022 from Arizona. At the time, two conservative justices \u2014 Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 said they would have heard the case. Pointing to a 1970 precedent that allowed fewer than 12 jurors, Gorsuch wrote that the opinion was \u201cwrong the day it was decided\u201d and that it \u201cimpairs both the integrity of the American criminal justice system and the liberties of those who come before our nation\u2019s courts.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/supreme-court-juries-state-felony-cases/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}

He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings.

Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_fulton-county-trump-floyd-ballots", "text": "A Fulton County judge will allow a\u00a0co-defendant of Donald Trump in the Georgia election subversion case\u00a0to continue his effort\u00a0to access thousands of 2020 ballots to argue debunked voter fraud theories. Harrison Floyd, who led the organization Black Voices for Trump in 2020, argued during a hearing Tuesday that he should not have been charged in the racketeering case because his concerns about voter fraud and questions about the election results were legitimate. Trump lost to President Joe Biden in Georgia by more than 12,000 votes. Floyd\u2019s attorneys are pushing to access more than 500,000 ballots from Fulton County, claiming they intend to produce \u201cevidence\u201d that thousands of votes were improperly excluded from the final vote tally. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee asked Floyd\u2019s attorneys on Tuesday to file additional information to the court in the coming weeks, including the scope of the expert review of the 2020 votes that they\u2019re seeking. McAfee also said he plans to have another hearing within the next two months to discuss the next steps in Floyd\u2019s attempt to access the ballots. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, found no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election after overseeing three separate counts of the ballots, conducting many other reviews of the process, and investigating more than 250 claims of voter fraud. Floyd is one of 15 remaining defendants, including Trump, facing charges related to efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. A Maryland resident, Floyd has been charged with three counts in Georgia, including racketeering, conspiracy to commit solicitation of false statements and writings, and influencing witnesses. Chad Alexis, senior assistant attorney for Fulton County, pushed back on 2020 voter-fraud arguments from Floyd\u2019s attorneys. Alexis also said the process of producing the ballots would take \u201cthousands of hours\u201d and that this is a busy presidential election year during which the county needs \u201call hands-on deck.\u201d \u201cThe county shouldn\u2019t have to bear the burden of manpower,\u201d Alexis argued. The Fulton County racketeering case against Trump has effectively been at a standstill. A Georgia appeals court is revisiting the question of whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be removed from prosecuting the case because of her romantic relationship with her former lead prosecutor Nathan Wade. And a legal argument before the Supreme Court over whether Trump has immunity from prosecution also remains an issue in the Georgia case. The high court is expected to issue a decision this summer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/fulton-county-trump-floyd-ballots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_samuel-alito-wife-upside-down-flag", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s wife previously said the inverted American flag flown at the couple\u2019s house in January 2021 was\u00a0\u201can\u00a0international signal of distress,\u201d\u00a0The Washington Post reported\u00a0Saturday, detailing an encounter during that time between the Alitos and a Post reporter outside the couple\u2019s home. The flag was no longer displayed when the reporter, Robert Barnes, visited the justice\u2019s house in Alexandria, Virginia, on the day of President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration to follow up on a related tip, the report said. Martha-Ann Alito demanded the reporter\u00a0\u201cget\u00a0off my property\u201d as he came across the couple leaving their home, The Post said. According to The Post, Martha-Ann Alito yelled,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0an international signal of distress!\u201d as Barnes sought information on the matter before the justice led his wife to a car while denying the flag was related to political protest and saying it stemmed from a neighborhood dispute. Martha-Ann Alito then shouted: \u201cAsk them what they did!\u201d in apparent reference to the Alitos\u2019 neighbors, before retrieving a novelty flag from the couple\u2019s home and yelling,\u00a0\u201cThere!\u00a0Is that better?\u201d after placing it on the flagpole, according to The Post. A spokeswoman for The Post said in the article that the newspaper didn\u2019t report on the interaction at the time\u00a0\u201cbecause\u00a0the flag-raising appeared to be the work of Martha-Ann Alito, rather than the justice, and connected to a dispute with her neighbors\u201d and that it was unclear it was rooted in politics. The Post\u2019s reporting comes as the conservative justice has become embroiled in controversy over displays outside his properties. The New York Times last week\u00a0published a photograph\u00a0of the inverted American flag raised at the Alitos\u2019 home in Virginia in 2021. Alito said the upside-down US flag\u00a0was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors. The dispute involved a neighbor who posted a sign saying\u00a0\u201cF**k\u00a0Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Alito said. The justice\u00a0told Fox News the Alitos got into an argument with the neighbor, who used the term\u00a0\u201cc**t\u201d\u00a0at one point. His wife then flew the inverted flag. The upside-down flag was a symbol for former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The Times then reported Wednesday that a flag that was on display during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was seen flying outside the Alitos\u2019 vacation home in New Jersey last summer.\u00a0The\u00a0\u201cAppeal\u00a0to Heaven\u201d flag, which dates to the Revolutionary War, has become a symbol for supporters of Trump. The revelations about the flags have drawn criticism in Washington, including from\u00a0key GOP senators and from Democrats, who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Senate Republican Whip John Thune, one of the contenders vying to replace retiring Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, told CNN the flag was a \u201cbad decision.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you explain that,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said. The news has also reenergized calls on the left for Congress to enact ethics rules for the Supreme Court, an effort has been stalled for months. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, who has been a frequent critic of conservative justices, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Thursday that it\u00a0\u201craises\u00a0a serious question\u201d for someone on the nation\u2019s highest court to fly such flags at his properties. Some Republican lawmakers have defended Alito, with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas telling CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday that the\u00a0\u201centire\u00a0hoopla is greatly overstated\u201d and accusing Senate Democrats of trying to delegitimize the court.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-hush-money-closing-arguments-takeaways", "text": "Prosecutors told jurors on Tuesday they\u2019ve seen a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d to prove that Donald Trump falsified business records in order to cover up a damaging story about an alleged affair at the end of the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s attorneys told the jury that the prosecution\u2019s criminal case against the former president is wholly reliant on the testimony of Michael Cohen \u2013 the \u201cMVP of liars\u201d who is out to get Trump. Which narrative the jury believes could ultimately decide Trump\u2019s legal fate. The defense and prosecution gave their closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial, spending many hours late into the evening Tuesday offering the jury diametrically opposed stories about the payment made to\u00a0Stormy Daniels in October 2016 and the subsequent reimbursement to Cohen the following year. On Wednesday, Judge Juan Merchan will give the jury his instructions in the morning, and then jurors will begin deliberations, with the historic and unprecedented trial \u2013 and a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 hanging in the balance. Here are takeaways from Day 21 of the Trump hush money trial: Defense argues jurors cannot convict on Michael Cohen\u2019s words Defense attorney Todd Blanche was up first, and he spent much of his two-hour closing argument attacking the credibility of Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer. He accused Cohen of lying directly to the jury, on top of the lies he was convicted of telling. Cohen lied so much, Blanche alleged, that he should be considered the Tom Brady of lying \u2013 the \u201cGLOAT,\u201d or the \u201cGreatest Liar of All Time.\u201d Blanche focused on Cohen\u2019s claims about his phone call with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen testified that Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller put Trump on the phone so Cohen could tell him he was going forward with the Daniels payment. During cross-examination, Blanche confronted Cohen with text messages he sent to Schiller around the same time as the call asking for help about a teenager prankster. \u201cWe all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days and forgot to block his number, and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that,\u201d Blanche said Tuesday. Blanche told the jury it\u2019s clear they were talking about the teen prankster because Cohen hung up and texted Schiller about the situation then followed up the next morning. \u201cThat is perjury,\u201d Blanche said, raising his voice as he slowly emphasized each syllable of the final word. Blanche also said that prosecutors offered no evidence connecting Trump to the payment to Daniels outside of Cohen\u2019s testimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen, period. And you cannot \u2013 you cannot \u2013 believe his words,\u201d Blanche told the jury. At the end of his closing argument, Blanche again returned to Cohen. \u201cHis words cannot the trusted,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cHe came in here, he raised his right hand and he lied to each of you repeatedly. You cannot send someone to prison \u2013 you cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen.\u201d Prosecutors objected to Blanche\u2019s commentary about prison \u2013 and Merchan admonished him for saying it, because jurors are not allowed to consider penalties, that\u2019s up to the judge \u2013 but Blanche had made his point regardless. Prosecution defends Cohen but argues there\u2019s more to the case Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass pushed back against Blanche\u2019s attack when it was his turn to present to the jury in the afternoon, arguing there was plenty of corroboration of Cohen\u2019s testimony, both from documents and the testimony of others, particularly former AMI chief David Pecker. \u201cWe didn\u2019t choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn\u2019t pick him up at the witness store. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf,\u201d Steinglass said of Cohen. Steinglass tried to rebut Blanche\u2019s allegation about the October 24, 2016, call with a bit of role-playing. The prosecutor put his thumb and forefinger to the side of his head and acted out a theoretical call Cohen could have made where he talked to both Schiller and Trump. \u201cHey, Keith, how\u2019s it going? It seems like this prankster might be a 14-year-old kid,\u201d Steinglass began the fake conversation, pretending to move into asking Schiller to pass the phone to Trump and then acting out a quick update on Daniels and the payment. When he finished the fake conversation, Steinglass said, \u201c49 seconds.\u201d The call between Schiller and Cohen lasted 1 minute 36 seconds, according to call logs. \u201cThese guys know each other well. They speak in coded language, and they speak fast,\u201d Steinglass said of Cohen and Trump. Steinglass also focused on testimony from Pecker to help bolster Cohen\u2019s credibility, such as showing that Cohen\u2019s story was corroborated by Pecker\u2019s description of a phone call with Trump about the Karen McDougal story in June 2016. \u201cTrump is deputizing Cohen right in front of Pecker so that Pecker knows that any go ahead from Cohen is a go head from Trump. This call makes it impossible for the defense to claim that Cohen was acting on his own here,\u201d Steinglass said, calling it \u201cpowerful evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement wholly apart from\u202fCohen.\u201d Prosecution walks jurors back through the whole case Steinglass spent 4 hours and 41 minutes walking jurors back through all of the documents and testimony they had heard over the six-week trial, beginning with the 2015 Trump Tower meeting all the way through Trump\u2019s pressure of Cohen in 2018 before Cohen began cooperating with federal investigators and pleaded guilty. \u201cThe name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man that benefited the most, the defendant, former President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he said. Steinglass argued that Pecker, Trump and Cohen entered into a conspiracy in 2015 when Pecker agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the campaign \u2013 alleging that the agreement went well beyond the normal bounds of a press relationship. When the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d story came out in October 2016, Steinglass said that Trump and the campaign went into panic mode. Around the time Trump\u2019s campaign was dealing with the fall out of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, he said, Trump was \u201cnegotiating to muzzle a porn star who was prepared to go public with allegations of extramarital sex.\u201d \u201cStormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant was not only words. She would have totally undermined his strategy for spinning away the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape,\u201d Steinglass said. Steinglass noted that when Cohen paid Daniels\u2019 attorney the $130,000 wire transfer through an LLC, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to jurors that Trump wasn\u2019t connected to the documents. \u201cNow it\u2019s true that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t sign these documents himself. That\u2019s kind of the whole point,\u201d Steinglass said. Steinglass walked jurors back through the hand-written calculations from former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to repay Cohen, in which Weisselberg wrote on Cohen\u2019s bank statement that the reimbursement would be \u201cgrossed up\u201d to account for taxes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to prove that the defendant made and created the false entries himself,\u201d Steinglass said. Trump is guilty of false business records when he makes or causes a false entry in his business records, Steinglass argued. Steinglass called the handwritten notes from Weisselberg and former Trump Org. controller Jeff McConney \u201cthe smoking guns.\u201d \u201cThey completely blow out of the water the defense claim that the payments\u201d were for \u201clegal services rendered,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless that they\u2019re trying to make this argument.\u201d Defense tries to raise \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 with jury Throughout his presentation, Blanche continued to raise the concept of reasonable doubt with the jury \u2013 even punctuating the conclusion of his closing argument with \u201c10 reasons\u201d why jurors should have reasonable doubt about the case \u201cEach one of these reasons makes a not guilty verdict a very easy path and a very quick path,\u201d Blanche said. Among his arguments: that the invoices and vouchers created to pay Cohen were accurate because Cohen was working as Trump\u2019s attorney, that Trump had no intent to defraud and that there\u2019s no evidence Trump knew the invoices were sent. Blanche also argued there was no attempt to conceal or commit another crime \u2013 one of the conditions needed for a felony conviction \u2013 and there was \u201cabsolutely\u201d no agreement to influence the 2016 election. Blanche argued that AMI would have run former Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin\u2019s story about an alleged love child had it been true, that McDougal did not want her story published and that Daniels\u2019 story was already made public in 2011, well before the election. Blanche concluded where he started, arguing that Cohen was the \u201chuman embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cHe is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true.\u201d Next up: The case will be in the jury\u2019s hands Now that closing arguments are done, the panel of seven men and five women are expected to begin deliberations Wednesday. Merchan is set to charge the jury Wednesday morning when they return at 10 a.m., giving them instructions on the law. The alternate jurors are expected to be held in the courthouse separate from the main panel that will consider the 34 counts against Trump.

Kennedy Jr. said he had a \u201cvisceral reaction against\u201d the removal of the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that was once the focal point of the deadly 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Kennedy said\u00a0in an interview\u00a0with podcast host Tim Pool on Friday that he opposes \u201cdestroying history\u201d when asked about the Charlottesville City Council\u2019s decision in 2021 to remove the town\u2019s statute of Lee and melt it down to create new public art. Kennedy, who went to law school at the University of Virginia, said he had a personal reaction to seeing the statue removed. \u201cI have a visceral reaction against the attacks on those statues,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThere were heroes in the Confederacy who didn\u2019t have slaves, and you know, I just have a visceral reaction against destroying history. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cI think we should celebrate who we are,\u201d Kennedy added. \u201cWe should celebrate the good qualities of everybody.\u201d The 2017 decision to remove the statute of Lee from a park in Charlottesville sparked outrage, including from White nationalist sympathizers who gathered at the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d protest that August and violently clashed with counter-protesters. Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd. Kennedy said he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink it\u2019s a good, a healthy thing for any culture to erase its history,\u201d and suggested historical figures like Lee should be celebrated for their positive qualities even if they also took actions that are now \u201cregarded as immoral \u2026 or wrong.\u201d \u201cWe need to be able to be sophisticated enough to live with, you know, our ancestors who didn\u2019t agree with us on everything, and who did things that are now, you know, regarded as immoral, you know, or wrong,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cMaybe they had other qualities that we want to celebrate.\u201d \u201cClearly, Robert E. Lee had extraordinary qualities of leadership,\u201d he added. Kennedy also defended his past celebration of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, a holiday celebrated on Columbus Day borne out of Native American advocacy to honor Indigenous peoples who inhabited the Americas. Pool, the podcast host, accused Kennedy of seeking to erase Christopher Columbus\u2019 legacy by celebrating Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, but Kennedy argued both holidays can be honored alongside each other. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to be part of a community where we can recognize all kinds of people. We can recognize Italian Americans to whom that is an important holiday, and at the same time, we can recognize the indigenous people who were, you know, made the ultimate sacrifice of one of the greatest genocides in the history,\u201d Kennedy said. At a rally in Philadelphia in October, during which he formally announced his switch from running in the Democratic primary to running as an independent, Kennedy said it\u2019s \u201ca hopeful sign\u201d that the US celebrates Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. Prior to his remarks, Kennedy was introduced by Lewis GrassRope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. \u201cIt\u2019s a hopeful sign now for our country that we celebrate Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day,\u201d Kennedy said last October. \u201cIt shows that our country is now ready to explore and to tell each other the untold histories of those dispossessed people who have previously languished on the margins.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/rfk-jr-robert-e-lee-statute-charlottesville/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The pier was \u201cdamaged and sections of the pier need rebuilding and repairing,\u201d\u00a0Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Tuesday. The pier will be removed from its location on the Gaza coast over the next 48 hours and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where US Central Command will carry out repairs, Singh said. The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying the effort to get the maritime corridor fully operating. Earlier, four US officials told CNN the pier broke apart in heavy seas. Part of the\u00a0pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies\u00a0transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before\u00a0the\u00a0pier can be used again. The damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier. \u201cI believe most of our soldiers were able to remain on the vessels and still are currently on them,\u201d Singh said during Tuesday\u2019s Pentagon press briefing. \u201cAnd \u2026 within the next 24 or 48 hours, the Israeli Navy will be helping push those vessels back and hopefully they\u2019ll be fully operational by then.\u201d The\u00a0pier,\u00a0which cost\u00a0$320 million,\u00a0had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop\u00a0one week later on May\u00a024,\u00a0two days before part of the pier disconnected.\u00a0It is unclear when shipments will resume. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour. Heavier sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0delayed the deployment of the\u00a0pier\u00a0for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions. The US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza. On Thursday, Vice Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper,\u00a0deputy\u00a0commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric\u00a0tons\u00a0of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations. Daniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID\u2019s Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \u201cthousands and thousands of\u00a0tons\u201d of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable. CNN\u2019s Paul Murphy contributed reporting. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_27_politics_trump-classified-documents-case-florida-dc", "text": "Before indicting Donald Trump last year for allegedly mishandling classified documents, federal prosecutors had to decide where to bring the charges: Washington, DC, or Florida. Ultimately, they charged the former president in Florida, a decision that has proven to be a fateful one \u2014 underscored by the vastly different approaches taken by DC judges as compared to the federal judge now presiding over the criminal case in Florida. Those approaches became apparent in the past week as opinions were unsealed\u00a0from two DC federal judges indicating how much more quickly and harshly for Trump the case might have played out had it remained in Washington. And over the long weekend, the federal judge overseeing Trump\u2019s case now in Florida has been thrust into a new debate about a gag order for the former president \u2014 an issue judges in DC already tackled. In the recently unsealed opinions, DC District Court Chief Judge James \u201cJeb\u201d Boasberg and his predecessor, Judge Beryl Howell, demonstrate a deep skepticism to arguments by Trump and his co-defendants on questions of attorney-client privilege and grand jury secrecy that Judge Aileen Cannon\u00a0has spent months deliberating over in Florida. Though it\u2019s been nearly a year since special counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for mishandling classified documents, the case remains stalled amid\u00a0Cannon\u2019s reluctance to rule\u00a0on issues before her and appears unlikely to go to trial before the November election. Cannon\u00a0now is being asked\u00a0to respond to a new request from prosecutors to curtail Trump\u2019s ability to comment about law enforcement and witnesses involved in the documents case, because he keeps suggesting misleadingly the FBI was prepared to use deadly force against him during the search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022. A federal judge in DC, Tanya Chutkan, who\u2019s handling a separate criminal case against the former president related to the 2020 election, placed a gag order on Trump months ago preventing him from commenting about witnesses and others in that case in a way that could intimidate them or hurt the proceedings. Cannon hasn\u2019t yet responded to prosecutors imploring her to limit Trump\u2019s speech in a filing Friday night. Investigation moved to Miami in final weeks The bulk of evidence against Trump in the documents case was taken in through a DC federal grand jury that continued to hear testimony months after the FBI seized hundreds of classified documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022.\u00a0But the Justice Department moved the investigation to a Miami grand jury in its final few weeks before charging Trump in South Florida\u2019s federal court because much of Trump\u2019s allegedly criminal actions took place at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida. Prosecutors have publicly disclosed little about the choice to move the case to Florida, though it has become a topic of discussion in the fights with the defense teams over secrecy, especially at a recent hearing before Cannon. \u201cI can say that the investigation that was ongoing before the DC grand jury had \u2013 had adequate nexus to continue in Washington. I\u2019m not prepared to comment on the date on which a decision to charge in Florida was made or what the internal deliberations were on that subject,\u201d special counsel\u2019s office prosecutor David Harbach told Cannon at a hearing last week. Trump and his co-defendants\u2019 attorneys have spent months trying to exploit that move, with the hopes that Cannon may think differently from Howell and Boasberg and want to scrutinize the prosecutors\u2019 choices. Cannon is now being asked to re-examine fundamental portions of the case that Howell and Boasberg had already ruled on, including prosecutors\u2019 ability to secure testimony in the DC grand jury from Trump\u2019s former attorney Evan Corcoran. Trump\u2019s team is seeking to cut that testimony out of the prosecutors\u2019 case entirely \u2014 an approach that might have been\u00a0harder for\u00a0the defense if the case had stayed in DC. Last year, Howell ordered Corcoran to testify in front of the grand jury after finding that his conversations with Trump were not protected by attorney-client privilege because they were in furtherance of a crime. Corcoran\u2019s testimony ended up informing key portions of the indictment against Trump and included detailed accounts of Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to keep the classified materials hidden from federal authorities. Bradley Moss, a DC-based lawyer with extensive national security experience, said that the ruling from Howell provided Cannon a \u201cclear road map\u201d to consider the attorney-client privilege issues. But Cannon hasn\u2019t even scheduled a hearing on the topic, which the parties began arguing over in court papers in February. \u201cThat she continues to sit on the matter is inexcusable,\u201d Moss said. Compared\u00a0to the DC judges, Cannon has been more reluctant to rule on issues\u00a0before her, often giving wide latitude for defendants\u2019 claims to be argued over several rounds in court and has entertained attempts to pull the case away from its central issues and into arguments viewed as fringe by a broad spectrum of legal scholars. \u2018Strong evidence\u2019 Trump hid documents Howell, in a pre-indictment ruling that let investigators obtain details of conversations\u00a0Trump\u00a0had with\u00a0his attorney that otherwise would have been protected by privilege, said that there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that Trump \u201cintended\u201d to hide the classified documents. Howell\u2019s 84-page opinion last March\u00a0agreed with prosecutors\u2019\u00a0arguments of potentially criminal obstructive behavior by Trump that is now central to the criminal case. Howell analyzed much of the same Trump conduct that girded charges that were filed roughly three months later, and the judge found that prosecutors had put forward \u201csufficient\u201d evidence of a crime to allow for the privilege to be breached. That is a lower bar than what an eventual jury will have to grapple with in the case. But the exercise required Howell to confront some of the very same Trump defenses that his lawyers are now putting before Cannon. For instance, Howell made the point that even if Trump, as a former president, had the authority to keep the classified materials, he was required by a relevant law to \u201csafeguard\u201d the information, and in this case the \u201cclassified documents were stored in unauthorized and unsecured locations,\u201d she said. A similar argument Trump made\u00a0in his trial court\u00a0has tied Cannon up in knots.\u00a0While she ultimately rejected\u00a0a Trump bid to dismiss the case on the grounds he could have kept them post-presidency, she did so after hours of oral arguments, an additional round of written arguments and with a ruling that sidestepped the legal merits of the argument. A \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 The\u00a0newly unsealed ruling from\u00a0Boasberg, meanwhile, rejected a request this month from Trump and his co-defendants that the DC-based judge hand over to Cannon several records of confidential grand jury proceedings. The effort to transfer the records is being spearheaded by Trump\u2019s valet and co-defendant Walt Nauta, who is seeking to bring scrutiny to a 2022 interaction his attorney had with prosecutors after Nauta stopped cooperating against Trump. Boasberg\u2019s ruling included a word of caution \u2014 perhaps an implicit jab at Cannon \u2014 about the possibility that the confidentiality of the grand jury would be hurt if its records were handed over to another court that is not fully steeped in\u00a0that\u00a0grand jury\u2019s\u00a0history. It was an apparent dead end with the DC-based judge. \u201cSuch a court, venturing beyond its expertise, may disclose more material than warranted,\u201d Boasberg wrote. Boasberg, an Obama appointee, cited extensive case law and even prior decisions in DC. He has also sent a \u201crecommendation\u201d to Cannon on how to handle secrecy of\u00a0other grand jury records more relevant to the case,\u00a0which\u00a0Boasberg\u2019s court has provided to the Florida court. Boasberg\u2019s ruling called out\u00a0Nauta\u2019s lawyers\u00a0for trying to game the system with Cannon in Florida in a search for past secret courts records that they think could help him. Boasberg deemed it, bitingly, a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u201cHis request extends to matters he knows nothing about,\u201d Boasberg wrote. \u201cHe imagines that upon transfer to Florida, the court presiding over his criminal case would sift through the records docket by docket and entry by entry, plucking out whatever material it deems relevant to his defense.\u201d Still, Nauta\u2019s attorney continued to argue to Cannon last week that even without the older records from DC, she could reopen the dispute Boasberg previously handled in her court. High-stakes implications Cannon, a Trump appointee confirmed to the bench in late 2020, has far less experience than the DC court handling cases where high-stakes political implications intersect with national security interests. For instance, Boasberg previously served as the chief judge on another powerful judicial bench that works almost solely in the national security space, the\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Intelligence Surveillance Court. The court looks at surveillance warrants related to\u00a0national security intelligence matters, and it handles extensive classified issues from its base\u00a0out of Washington. And Howell, also an Obama appointee, is one of the most seasoned judges in the country on the sort of attorney-client privilege disputes\u00a0that occurred during the Trump grand jury investigations,\u00a0with more public opinions on the topic in politically charged investigations than perhaps any other judge in the country. Cannon, conversely, has presided over only four criminal trials since Trump appointed her to the bench in 2020, in a courthouse\u00a0\u200bso sleepy it didn\u2019t have a secured facility to look at classified records until months after Trump\u2019s case landed on her docket last June. She is taking months to work through classified records issues in the case, and hasn\u2019t even scheduled hearings on a major set of disputes to come over the national security records the defense lawyers may want to use at trial. \u201cSimply greater exposure to this litigation process alone speaks to the speed and detail with which these two DC judges handled these matters in comparison to Judge Cannon,\u201d\u00a0Moss said.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "The political calculation has changed again for Nikki Haley. Not long ago, the former South Carolina governor was arguing that Donald Trump was too old, too chaotic, too \u201cunhinged\u201d and too prone to temper tantrums to be president again and said he couldn\u2019t beat President Joe Biden. \u201cI feel no need to kiss the ring,\u201d Haley said in February before suspending her primary campaign.\u00a0\u201cMy political future is of no concern.\u201d But on Wednesday, she delivered the implicit endorsement everyone knew was coming sooner or later. Haley said that while Trump had not been \u201cperfect\u201d on issues that matter to her, like foreign policy and the national debt, Biden had been a \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d \u201cSo, I will be voting for Trump,\u201d said the former US ambassador to the United Nations, who served in the ex-president\u2019s Cabinet. After a friendly photo-op in front of the Oval Office fireplace, she left that job in 2018 before she could be tarnished by association with Trump\u2019s mayhem. As 2024 loomed on the calendar, Haley said she would not run for president against her old boss \u2014 then did so anyway \u2014 to Trump\u2019s lingering fury. Before losing her home state\u2019s primary to Trump earlier this year, Haley lashed out at Republicans who backed Trump despite privately despairing over him. \u201cIn politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. \u2026 Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he\u2019s been and will continue to be for our party. They\u2019re just too afraid to say it out loud.\u201d Now Haley is saying out loud she\u2019s voting for Trump. But she had little choice but to join the herd if she wants a future in a party dominated by its presumptive nominee. It\u2019s the same decision reached by Ted Cruz, whose wife was once publicly humiliated by Trump but who has long since attached himself to the former president. On Wednesday night, the Harvard Law School graduate, who presently represents Texas in the US Senate, refused an invitation by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins to unconditionally accept the forthcoming results of the 2024 election. \u201cLook, if the Democrats win, I will accept the result. But I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d said Cruz, who then, in true Trump fashion, cited baseless claims that the 2020 contest was rife with fraud. There\u2019s not much of a path in the alternative: former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a onetime rising GOP star, became an example of what happens to conservative foreign policy hawks who refuse to temper warnings that Trump is a danger to democracy. Haley seeks to preserve her future There is every sign that Haley wants to run again for president once Trump finally leaves the stage. So repudiating him now would serve no personal political purpose except to end her career on a point of principle. History might applaud her selflessness, but power would likely remain out of her reach. Haley\u2019s move will reinforce an impression that she always adopts the political course most advantageous to her ambitions. But if Biden wins in November, she can say she predicted Trump would lose. If a Trump second term is a disaster, she\u2019s on the record predicting chaos. She could then be positioned to try to lead the GOP back to the pre-Trump positions on foreign policy and the economy that seem closest to her own beliefs, even if she often seemed in 2024 to be auditioning for the leadership of a party that doesn\u2019t exist in any recognizable form. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who has said that Trump should not be let anywhere near the White House again, said he was disappointed by Haley\u2019s decision. \u201cI think she has obviously made a political calculation that it is in her interests to support Donald Trump,\u201d Bolton told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Wednesday. Haley \u2013 who won Vermont and Washington, DC \u2013 is not the only younger GOP presidential candidate with still-burning White House dreams to undergo such a transformation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lashed out at Trump when his own campaign faded in frigid Iowa in January, then endorsed him on the way out of the race far more quickly than Haley did. During her campaign, Haley argued that both Biden, who is 81, and Trump who turns 78 next month, were both too old to be president and called for cognitive tests for candidates over 75. But her decision to focus only on Biden\u2019s liabilities on Wednesday raises the questions of whether her voters will follow her in Trump\u2019s direction. Since she suspended her campaign, tens of thousands of voters in GOP primaries have continued to vote for her. This support is a living legacy of a campaign in which she set herself up as a vessel for Republicans who disdain Trump and wanted another candidate. Haley was especially strong in suburban areas where the ex-president struggles most. And the Biden campaign signaled that it would compete for this bloc of wavering GOP voters in November. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a place for Haley voters in my campaign,\u201d the president said during a fundraiser in the swing state of Georgia over the weekend. However, many Haley voters confided at events in New Hampshire and Iowa earlier this year that though they preferred her, they\u2019d probably stick with their party as loyal Republicans if Trump beat her to the nomination. In that sense, Haley\u2019s decision \u2013 while dripping with political expedience \u2013 may be one that many of her supporters are also wrestling with. The choice for Republicans who dislike Trump and are considering Biden is a more complex question in this election than the previous one. Now, Biden is the incumbent with a list of achievements and policies that directly contradict the core beliefs of many Republicans, including on foreign policy and economics. Memories of the chaos of the Trump administration have also diminished. Traditional national security Republicans may also perceive global war and chaos and Biden\u2019s growing feud with a right-wing Israeli prime minister as a reason not to switch their vote. \u201cA lot of Republicans are making the same calculation because the performance of the Biden administration has been so appalling,\u201d Bolton said. Political ambition behind Haley\u2019s choice Haley said she\u2019d vote for Trump while speaking at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, during her first major political speech since suspending her Republican presidential campaign. Her announcement during a Q&A seemed illogical. She had just delivered a hardline speech melding Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cold War hawkishness with the neoconservative notes of the Bush administration yet was promising to vote for an ex-president who has eviscerated both GOP foreign policy codes with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy. Haley argued that she wanted to vote for a candidate who would have \u201cthe backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account and who would secure the border.\u201d But during his first term, Trump often cozied up to US enemies like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un and spent four years berating US allies in Europe and Asia for freeloading off the United States. Biden, by contrast, has reinvigorated and expanded US alliances, especially NATO, which Trump despises. The Western alliance now has more direction than at any time since the end of the Cold War. And Trump might talk a good game on immigration, but he recently derailed the most conservative border bill in decades, apparently because he wanted to deprive Biden of an election-year win and preserve his narrative of a nation under siege. The tepid nature of Haley\u2019s support for Trump leaves some questions, including whether she will agree to campaign for him and whether she\u2019ll urge her voters to back him. While saying she\u2019d vote for the ex-president, Haley urged him to take steps to reach out to her voters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him. And I genuinely hope he does that,\u201d she said. Trump has made no effort to appeal to Haley voters during the march to the nomination despite his dire need to court suburban voters. And he was quick to knock down reports recently that the former South Carolina governor could be on his shortlist for the vice presidential nomination. But any accommodation between the two political foes would be a reminder that it\u2019s best not to take what happens in presidential primary campaigns too seriously. Haley, after all, went from one extreme to the other during her bid. She spent months offering only the mildest condemnations of Trump, who sought to overturn the 2020 election to stay in power. Like other GOP candidates, she was unable to solve the conundrum of how to run against the ex-president, who is still wildly popular with base voters, while avoiding alienating his supporters. When she did turn fully on Trump amid the snows of New Hampshire, it was as an act of last resort as it became clear she had no route to the nomination. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on February 1, Haley said Trump had experienced some \u201cconfused moments\u201d in prior days and rebuked the ex-president for a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d on the night of his New Hampshire primary win when he tried to push her out of the race. During an appearance in Columbia, South Carolina, Haley asked an audience:\u00a0\u201cDo you really think he is going to win against Joe Biden when he is spending that much on legal fees? He is not.\u201d On February 12, Haley told Tapper that Trump was \u201ccompletely unhinged\u201d and accused the former president of siding with Putin over NATO members. \u201cRightly or wrongly, chaos follows (Trump),\u201d Haley complained at almost every event. \u201cWe have too much division in this country, and too many threats around the world to be sitting in chaos once again.\u201d But that\u2019s the \u201cchaos\u201d she\u2019ll be voting for in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Kennedy Jr. was eliminated from contention for the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential nomination during the party\u2019s convention Sunday. In a surprise move earlier Sunday, Kennedy was put up for consideration as a nominee to represent the party in 2024. But he received support from just 19 delegates, or 2.07%, in the first round of voting and was eliminated. Political activist Chase Oliver ultimately won the Libertarian presidential nomination Sunday night at the convention in Washington, DC, after seven rounds of voting. Kennedy, who spoke at the convention on Friday, was nominated by a delegate Sunday on the convention floor, where his candidacy was met with boos from other delegates. Donald Trump was also nominated on the convention floor Sunday, but Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle ruled that the former president did not qualify because he did not submit nominating papers. Trump spoke Saturday at the convention, where he was loudly and consistently booed, particularly when he asked attendees to \u201cnominate me or at least vote for me.\u201d Trump received votes from six delegates as a write-in candidate. In a rebuke of the former president, adult film actress Stormy Daniels \u2013 whose alleged affair with Trump is at the center of his hush money trial in New York \u2013 received a vote from one delegate. (Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case.) Candidates who received less than 5% of the vote were eliminated in the first round. In each subsequent round, the candidate with the lowest vote total was eliminated. After Kennedy\u2019s elimination, he urged Libertarians to back his campaign even though \u201cwe may not agree on every downstream issue.\u201d The independent hopeful said in a social media post Sunday that addressing the convention was \u201ca high point of my campaign.\u201d \u201cWhat an unexpected honor to wake up this morning to a groundswell in the Libertarian Party seeking to nominate me. I would have accepted the nomination if offered because independents and third parties need to unite right now to reclaim our country from the corrupt two-party system,\u201d Kennedy said. Kennedy told CNN last week that he did not intend to seek the party\u2019s nomination at the convention this weekend. Tim O\u2019Brien, a Libertarian delegate from New Jersey, said he felt Kennedy was trying to use the party for his own gain without respecting its values. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of people come into the party, they\u2019ll run, they\u2019ll make a big stink and then leave. And I guarantee you, he may come here; he\u2019s not going to be here after the election,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe want people that are willing to say, full force, \u2018We\u2019re Libertarians, we\u2019re staying with you guys,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cHe has no need for us. He wants to get ballot access.\u201d Kennedy, a onetime Democrat, began courting Libertarian officials even before he left the Democratic presidential primary last fall to run as an independent. He met with McArdle in July and February to discuss their shared beliefs. The Libertarian ticket was seen as a possible pathway for Kennedy to circumvent ballot access hurdles and take advantage of the party\u2019s access to ballots in dozens of states. Kennedy is on the ballot in six states so far, compared with 38 states for the Libertarians. Kennedy\u2019s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, told CNN on Sunday that the Libertarian Party was \u201cmore relevant than ever\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of possibility of success of us working together.\u201d The Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur\u2019s comments marked the first time she has taken questions from a major news outlet since she joined Kennedy\u2019s campaign in March. Shanahan had been expected to make remarks at the convention Sunday but said she ultimately did not as party votes were running behind schedule. On Monday, she shared on social media the text of the speech she had expected to give. Her planned remarks included telling the audience that Covid-19 vaccines were \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d and pledging to protect civil liberties from government and corporate overreach. \u201cThe reason why a candidate like Bobby Kennedy can win this next election is because he is the only candidate who has successfully fought the institutions and corporations that have stolen our right to health and liberty. He understands the deeply troubling, almost demonic forces that have overtaken our agencies, and our culture,\u201d the prepared remarks read. \u201cThe vaccine mandates that spread across the globe in 2021 were wrong, not only because the vaccines were unsafe, and not only because they were ineffective. They were wrong because they deprived us of the most basic liberty there is,\u201d the prepared remarks continued. Covid-19 vaccines have proved to be safe and effective. Shanahan\u2019s planned speech also made multiple references to former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who previously ran for president as both a Libertarian and a Republican. Kennedy told CNN last week following a rally in Colorado that his views on the environment, foreign policy and Covid-19 would appeal to Libertarian voters. \u201cMy approach is a free-market approach, which appeals to Libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against war, which I think is another important issue for Libertarians. I support constitutional rights. President Trump dismantled our constitutional rights during Covid. So I think Libertarians are probably more inclined to support me if they follow their philosophies.\u201d Trump and Kennedy in recent weeks have ramped up their attacks on each other, as the former president\u2019s advisers increasingly come to see the independent\u2019s bid as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy\u2019s support in national surveys has reached double digits \u2013 at 16% in a\u00a0CNN poll conducted last month by SSRS\u00a0\u2013 with strong indications that he is siphoning support from both Trump and President Joe Biden. As the threat has crystalized, so have Trump\u2019s attacks on Kennedy. The former president now regularly attacks Kennedy in public remarks and on social media. Earlier this month, Trump released a lengthy video that labeled Kennedy a \u201cDemocrat plant.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_libertarian-party-trump-convention-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was loudly and consistently booed throughout his speech Saturday at the Libertarian Party\u2019s national convention, particularly when he asked attendees to \u201cnominate me or at least vote for me.\u201d The heckling began the moment the former president took the stage, and some of his supporters in the room tried to drown out the boos with chants of \u201cWe want Trump.\u201d \u201cNow I think you should nominate me or at least vote for me, and we should win together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause the Libertarians want to vote for me \u2026 and it\u2019s very important because we have to get rid of the worst president in history.\u201d Trump added, \u201cOnly do that if you want to win; if you want to lose, don\u2019t do that. Keep getting your 3% every four years.\u201d (In 2016, Libertarian presidential nominee\u00a0Gary Johnson\u00a0earned more than 3% of the popular vote \u2013 a high point in the party\u2019s history.) Trump left the stage after 34 minutes, marking one of his shortest campaign speeches to date. Chase Oliver ultimately won the Libertarian Party presidential nomination Sunday night after seven rounds of voting at the convention. Trump\u2019s stop at the convention marked an unconventional one for a presumptive Republican nominee, but it is illustrative of\u00a0his campaign\u2019s intensifying concern\u00a0over third-party candidates. The outreach to Libertarians follows weeks of stepped-up attacks by Trump aimed at\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose high-profile independent White House bid is increasingly viewed by the former president\u2019s advisers as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy, who spoke at the convention on Friday, was nominated by a delegate Sunday on the convention floor, where his candidacy was met with boos from other delegates. He was eliminated as a potential nominee in the first round of voting after receiving support from 19 delegates, or just 2.07% of delegates. Trump was also nominated on the convention floor Sunday, but Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle ruled the former president was not qualified because he did not submit nominating papers. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t file paperwork for the Libertarian Nomination, which I would have absolutely gotten if I wanted it (as everyone could tell by the enthusiasm of the Crowd last night!), was the fact that, as the Republican Nominee, I am not allowed to have the Nomination of another Party,\u201d Trump posted Sunday on Truth Social. \u201cRegardless, I believe I will get a Majority of the Libertarian Votes.\u201d According to Trump\u2019s campaign, a Republican presidential candidate can\u2019t be nominated by two political parties in most states. The scene inside the Washington Hilton was at times raucous Saturday, as Trump supporters and Libertarians clashed. McArdle, the party chair, took the stage ahead of Trump\u2019s speech to tell supporters of the former president sitting in the front rows to make room for the Libertarian delegates. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, like, fight with people or beg and plead. Let\u2019s just make room for the delegates, because those are the people you\u2019re trying to persuade, right? You are already sold. Our delegates are not sold, and President Trump is here to try to sell them,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cThose of you who are Donald Trump supporters, I think what I would like to see tonight is for us to all get along and come to an understanding and find areas of agreement even if we don\u2019t agree to vote for the same person,\u201d she added. Also ahead of the speech, Secret Service agents confiscated rubber chickens that the super PAC aligned with Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign had passed out to attendees. \u201cNo lighters, no water bottles, no noisy chickens,\u201d one agent yelled to attendees waiting to go through the security checkpoint. Tony Lyons, the co-chair of the pro-Kennedy American Values 2024 super PAC, confirmed to CNN that the group had distributed the rubber chickens at the convention Saturday. Libertarians in the crowd at times confronted Trump supporters, and some audience members were escorted out of the venue. One Libertarian critic of Trump was forced to leave after CNN observed him throwing a punch at a Trump-supporting audience member. Several people toward the front of the room turned their backs to Trump as he spoke. One of Trump\u2019s few loud applause lines Saturday came when he announced that if elected, he would commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the underground website Silk Road, which let users anonymously buy and sell anything from drugs to hacking tutorials. Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 following his conviction on seven counts ranging from money laundering to drug trafficking, and many attendees at the Libertarian convention have been arguing for his pardon. Trump also received cheers when he said he would put a Libertarian in his Cabinet and appoint Libertarians to senior positions in his administration in a potential second term. Prior to the speech, the Trump campaign said it anticipated getting an unfriendly reception from some attendees \u2013 former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, now a Trump surrogate, received loud boos when he mentioned the former president in his speech at the convention Friday. \u201cDo we know that it\u2019s not exactly home base? Absolutely. There will be people who want him to be there and people who don\u2019t want him to be there, but we\u2019re on offense and competing for nontraditional votes in order to unite the country,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN. Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s campaign cast Trump as \u201canti-freedom\u201d ahead of his address. \u201cDonald Trump says his Republican Party is the party of freedom, but tell that to the women who have had the freedom to make their own health care decisions ripped away and their pregnancies monitored by the government,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement Saturday. Biden was also invited to speak at the convention but didn\u2019t respond, McArdle told CNN earlier. At a news conference immediately following Trump\u2019s speech,\u00a0Chase Oliver, a Libertarian presidential candidate, said that he believed it was a mistake to invite Trump but that he was proud that Libertarians heckled the former president during his remarks. \u201cI don\u2019t like having a war criminal on this stage. I don\u2019t feel he deserves a spot on this stage,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cWhile I think it was a mistake to have invited Donald Trump, I\u2019m glad he got to see a glimpse of what a real Libertarian reception feels like.\u201d Michael Rectenwald, another Libertarian presidential candidate, said he believed the party achieved some gains by inviting Trump to the convention, pointing to the former president\u2019s commitment to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence. \u201cWe got a major political party candidate to say that he would free Ross Ulbricht,\u201d Rectenwald said at the news conference. \u201cWe moved the needle toward liberty.\u201d Still, Rectenwald acknowledged that Trump\u2019s remarks were unlikely to persuade Libertarians to vote for the former president. \u201cThere are no people in this room in the Libertarian Party at risk for falling for Trump\u2019s bullsh*t,\u201d he said. Trent Nestle, a Libertarian delegate from Tennessee, told CNN that Trump\u2019s pledge to commute Ulbricht\u2019s sentence wouldn\u2019t be enough to convince him to back the former president. \u201cI want to see it happen,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cIt won\u2019t change my vote in November.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_third-party-president-what-matters", "text": "They booed former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who currently leads in polling in some swing states. They rejected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who is polling at 15% in some polls. Instead, at its convention over the weekend, the Libertarian Party selected a little-known former congressional candidate, Chase Oliver, who is hoping they can get to 2% of the popular vote on Election Day. Turns out that Libertarians are motivated by the ultrasmall-government mindset that leads them to be Libertarians as opposed to an uncomfortable alliance to benefit Trump or help Kennedy get on a debate stage. A match with Kennedy made some sense, at least on paper. Libertarians currently have ballot access in 38 states. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in six, although he promises to be on more by Election Day. But the idea of simply placing Kennedy atop the Libertarian Party ticket to marry his momentum with their organization left Kennedy with an embarrassing loss at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington. Kennedy did not even advance out of the first round of voting. Neither did Trump, who could arguably appeal to some Libertarians with his anti-government rhetoric. After his address, Trump was barred from taking part in the nominating process because his campaign failed to fill out the proper paperwork. Where does Kennedy\u2019s support come from? Kennedy\u2019s politics are unique, melding his history as an environmental crusader, his deeply held belief in conspiracy theories and his notable vaccine skepticism. These views are not necessarily very Libertarian. He is at odds with his own running mate, Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of a Google co-founder and a top benefactor of the campaign. Kennedy and Shanahan disagree on both abortion policy and Middle East policy. Among those who didn\u2019t vote for Biden or Trump in 2020 \u2013 including both those who supported another candidate and those who didn\u2019t vote at all \u2013 Kennedy got the support of 37% in CNN\u2019s poll conducted by SSRS in April. Trump got the backing of 30% of these voters who either opted for a major party alternative or simply didn\u2019t vote. Biden got just 12%. Kennedy may well take more support from Trump than from Biden, but not by a lot, according to a recent analysis by CNN\u2019s Harry Enten (watch it below). As evidence, Enten pointed to Quinnipiac University polling that asked Kennedy supporters who they would support in a two-way matchup. About half \u2013 51% \u2013 said they would support Trump in a two-way matchup, compared with 37% who said they would pick Biden. In a written analysis, Enten points to polling that suggests many of Kennedy\u2019s current supporters are not yet familiar with many of his most notable positions, including on vaccines. Support for third-party candidates has a tendency to flag closer to Election Day. The recent high-water mark is Ross Perot, who got 19% of the vote in 1992. The last third-party candidate to win a state and get Electoral Votes was George Wallace, who won Southern states in 1968. The only third-party candidate to outperform a major party candidate was former President Teddy Roosevelt, who outpolled Republicans after he failed to get their nomination in 1912 and then ran as a third-party candidate. Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, won that election. What are Libertarians aiming for? While Kennedy is polling better than recent third-party or independent candidates, most of them barely register. If Oliver can reach 2% in the popular vote, that would be better than the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in 2020 but still far short of Gary Johnson\u2019s 3.28% of the popular vote in 2016. CNN\u2019s Aaron Pellish was at the Libertarian convention. When I asked him why there was so much opposition to Kennedy and Trump, Pellish sent me these distinct thoughts: First and foremost, Libertarian opposition to Trump and Kennedy starts with fundamental disagreements on policy. Despite both candidates calling for the US to reduce its involvement in foreign conflicts, many Libertarians feel Trump and Kennedy don\u2019t go far enough to prevent wars globally. Many Libertarians also support eliminating the Federal Reserve and oppose the government taxing citizens, extreme measures neither Trump nor Kennedy endorsed in their remarks at the convention.  Several Libertarians I spoke to were frustrated by what they viewed as attempts by both candidates to pander to party members for votes in November.  A few convention attendees linked Kennedy and Trump to Bob Barr, the former GOP congressman who ran as the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2008, and to Bill Weld, the former Republican Massachusetts gov. who ran alongside Gary Johnson as the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Both Barr and Weld left the Libertarian Party after losing their respective elections.  But the memory of past politicians who used the party for their own gain without fully committing to Libertarian values appeared to undergird the resentment some Libertarians held for the two interlopers. The inverse comparison is Ron Paul, who ran for president as a Libertarian in the 1980s but found greater success when he ran as a Libertarian-leaning Republican. Paul did not \u2013 and never was going to \u2013 get the Republican nomination, but he made a calculated decision that he could more effectively influence the policy conversation from within a major party. Now Kennedy\u2019s campaign, and the super PAC that supports it, will have to continue the slog of getting on ballots in enough states to make a mark on the election. The Green Party is the only third party that is consistently on the ballot in all 50 states. It will not officially select a nominee until July. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2012 and 2016, is seen as a likely bet. The best recent election for the Green Party came in 2000, when Ralph Nader won more than 2% of the vote and arguably kept Al Gore, the Democrat, from winning Florida and the presidency. Less than 2% can sway an election The Republican consultant who orchestrated George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns, Karl Rove, notes in The Wall Street Journal that the Green Party candidate in 2016, Stein, got more votes than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He concludes Stein arguably cost the Democratic ticket, led by Hillary Clinton, the election. The same thing may have happened in 2020, Rove argues, when the Libertarian\u2019s Jorgensen got less than 2% of the national vote but exceeded Biden\u2019s margin of victory in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. Those stats are true, but Rove\u2019s assessment may be flawed. Johnson, the Libertarian candidate in 2016, outperformed Stein in each of those states Rove mentioned. Trump won anyway. The election reform advocacy group FairVote has compiled data on recent third-party candidates here. But rather than focus on the relatively few people who turn out for a third-party candidate, why not look at the large number of people who don\u2019t take part in elections at all? The 2020 presidential election won by Biden had the highest turnout of any presidential election since 1900. But only about two-thirds \u2013 66% \u2013 of eligible voters turned out to vote, according to an analysis by Pew Research Center, although turnout was higher in some states than others.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/third-party-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_libertarian-nominee-chase-oliver", "text": "Chase Oliver won the Libertarian Party presidential nomination on Sunday after seven rounds of voting at the party\u2019s convention in Washington, DC. The 38-year-old, who has previously run for Congress multiple times in Georgia, focused his pitch on making Libertarian values palatable to a broader audience. In an interview with CNN following his nomination, Oliver said he believes earning 2% of the vote nationally in November\u2019s general election is a reasonable goal. \u201cI got 2.1% of the vote when I ran for the Senate in Georgia. I think that\u2019s a definite doable thing, and certainly we can improve upon that with a hard-run campaign that wakes people up,\u201d he said. When asked how he plans to compete with President Joe Biden, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump and Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., to expand his share of the vote, Oliver said he plans to speak to \u201cas many people as possible,\u201d while projecting confidence he can disrupt the balance of power between Democrats and Republicans. \u201cI\u2019m ready to continue to be a fly in the ointment of the two-party system,\u201d he said. Oliver was sharply critical of Trump\u2019s appearance at the Libertarian convention. At a news conference following the former president\u2019s remarks, which were heavily and consistently booed by Libertarian audience members, Oliver called it a \u201cmistake\u201d to have Trump speak. \u201cYou are not a libertarian, Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a war criminal and you deserve to be shamed by everyone in this hall.\u201d Oliver has called for simplifying the pathway to citizenship for immigrants and expanding work visas and has strongly opposed US involvement in foreign wars. He has said he wants to encourage states to \u201cdecriminalize\u201d abortion procedures while also promoting alternatives to abortion. Oliver\u2019s victory at Sunday\u2019s convention marks a defeat for the Mises Caucus, a group of right-leaning Libertarians who have grown in stature within the party in recent years. Libertarian Party Chair Angela McArdle, who was reelected to her position at the convention this weekend, is a member of the caucus. \u201cWhile this last ballot\u2019s been going on, I\u2019ve heard from so many people concerned that I\u2019m going to leave them out of this campaign,\u201d Oliver said Sunday evening in his acceptance speech. \u201cI urge you to understand that I want to unify this party around the common principles that we all respect.\u201d Kennedy, after being put up as a candidate for the nomination early Sunday, was eliminated from contention during the first round of voting. Oliver secured the nomination after striking a deal with Mike ter Maat, one of the last three candidates in the nominating process. Ter Maat endorsed Oliver on the floor of the convention following the fifth round of voting, saying he accepted Oliver\u2019s offer to be his vice presidential candidate after expressing concerns about the Mises Caucus\u2019 strategy. The Mises Caucus had officially endorsed Michael Rectenwald, who led the early rounds of voting. But in the sixth round, neither Oliver nor Rectenwald earned the necessary 50% majority to secure the nomination, although they were the only two candidates remaining on the ballot. The final round of voting pitted Oliver against \u201cnone of the above.\u201d McArdle explained ahead of the final round that if \u201cnone of the above\u201d were to win, the party would not nominate a candidate for president this year. Oliver won with 497 votes, earning 60% of the vote to 36% for \u201cnone of the above.\u201d Tom Markey, a Rhode Island delegate, said he likes Oliver because he\u2019s more likely to earn support from a wide range of voters than Rectenwald. \u201cSome people are just direct libertarians, and they\u2019re stuck on one thing,\u201d Markey said. \u201c(Oliver) may come across to Democrats and Republicans as being, \u2018All right, that makes sense.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe would cross the lines a bit better,\u201d Markey added. Oliver touted his visits to all 50 states prior to this weekend\u2019s nominating convention as evidence of his commitment to earning as many votes as possible. And speaking to CNN after securing the nomination, he also pointed to benchmarks other than victory in November for a successful campaign, including increasing the number of registered Libertarians and expanding ballot access for the party. \u201cIf we can\u2019t win the White House, there are many other metrics of victory,\u201d he said. Rectenwald told CNN while voting was still ongoing at the convention that Oliver winning the nomination would signify an embrace of \u201cwokeness,\u201d which he called an \u201cauthoritarian, totalitarian ideology.\u201d \u201cIt kind of turns (the party) into a referendum, sort of, for a particular kind of status ideology, one that is interested in protecting special identity category\u2026 people,\u201d Rectenwald said. \u201cThat is, effectively woke. Woke ideology.\u201d Oliver, who is gay, has said he joined the Libertarian Party after encountering the party at the Atlanta Pride Festival in 2010. In 2020, he ran as a Libertarian in the special election in Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District to replace the late Rep. John Lewis. In 2022, he ran for Senate against Democratic Sen.

The call was placed by the husband of a neighbor who exchanged words with Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann Alito, after the neighbor put up yard signs critical of Republicans.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-gag-order-cannon-classified-documents", "text": "Federal Judge Aileen Cannon on Tuesday rejected special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s request for a gag order against Donald Trump in the classified documents case, saying that prosecutors\u2019 efforts to confer with the defendant was \u201cwholly lacking in substance and professional courtesy.\u201d In a brief order, Cannon slammed prosecutors for not following the court\u2019s rules by failing to meaningfully confer with Trump\u2019s defense lawyers about a potential gag order before making the request. \u201cBecause the filing of the Special Counsel\u2019s Motion did not adhere to these basic requirements, it is due to be denied without prejudice,\u201d Cannon wrote, adding, \u201cit should go without saying that meaningful conferral is not a perfunctory exercise.\u201d The judge\u2019s order highlights the cumbersome filing process that has repeatedly plagued the case as it inches towards trial. Prosecutors can ask for a gag order again, Cannon said, once they give \u201csufficient time\u201d to Trump\u2019s defense team to read the motion and discuss it with prosecutors. The special counsel\u2019s request \u2013 the first in the\u00a0classified documents mishandling case\u00a0\u2013 came after Trump repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the\u00a0search and seizure of government records at his resort in August 2022. Trump\u2019s campaign, for instance, sent a fundraising email on Tuesday that claimed FBI agents were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d at Mar-a-Lago. While Trump has told his supporters he could have been in danger because of the policy, it is standard protocol for FBI searches and limits how agents may use force in search operations.\u00a0The same standard FBI policy was used in the searches of President Joe Biden\u2019s homes and offices in\u00a0a separate\u00a0classified documents investigation. In a blistering court filing late on Memorial Day, attorneys for Trump said that the gag order request was an \u201cextraordinary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional censorship application\u201d to target Trump\u2019s speech as he runs for president. The attorneys also said that prosecutors, whom they referred to as \u201cself-appointed Thought Police,\u201d were \u201cseeking to condition President Trump\u2019s liberty on his compliance\u201d with their own views. Though many outside legal experts have been critical of Cannon\u2019s approach to the classified documents case in the past, in this instance, Cannon was \u201cright,\u201d said Mark Schnapp, a south Florida defense attorney not involved in the case, who pointed to the court\u2019s local rules for meeting and conferring. Schnapp said it \u201cjust looks bad\u201d for the prosecutors to move forward with filing the motion on a Friday night of a holiday weekend when the defense team had offered to discuss the gag order request on Monday. \u201cWas it going to be a futile exercise? Yes,\u201d said Schnapp. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t\u00a0the kind of thing that they should have filed without following the rules.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-gag-order-cannon-classified-documents/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_politics_tony-gonzales-uvalde-congress-runoff", "text": "Rep. Tony Gonzales called his GOP opponent in Texas a \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d and an \u201canarchist\u201d intent on \u201cburning the place down\u201d \u2014 and said Republican hardliners seeking to oust him are a bunch of \u201cscumbags\u201d and MAGA wannabes. In an interview with CNN, the two-term Texas GOP congressman said the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s runoff against gun activist Brandon Herrera will send a clear message to Republicans amid a period of bitter intraparty infighting that has led to an ousted speaker, a stalled agenda and roiled relations across the House GOP Conference. \u201cAre we going to be the party that governs and gets things done in a conservative manner?\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cOr are we going to be the party that has jesters that come up here and say wild and crazy outrageous things and just try to burn the place down?\u201d Gonzales\u2019 runoff underscores the intense GOP divide in the narrowly divided House, where hard-right members have grown more emboldened and willing to derail their party\u2019s agenda if there\u2019s a whiff of compromise with Democrats. And the fight is playing out in GOP primaries across the country, the outcome of which will have major ramifications for the direction of the House Republican Conference and the agenda it pursues in\u00a0the next Congress. Gonzales\u2019 race has become ground zero for that fight. Gonzales, whose district includes Uvalde, which witnessed one of the worst school shootings in history two years ago, later voted for a bipartisan gun safety bill that has become a centerpiece of Herrera\u2019s campaign against him. Gonzales said, \u201cI don\u2019t regret any of my votes.\u201d \u201cSomething has to change,\u201d he said, noting his constituents were clamoring for action and that even his kids wear bulletproof backpacks to school. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair.\u201d But it was that vote that has generated backlash on the right \u2014 on top of his handling of talks over a GOP immigration bill last year that grew tense and that some hardliners haven\u2019t forgotten. And the insults Gonzales has leveled have only enraged his GOP critics. \u201cHe is a RINO-establishment moderate who is about to be voted out of office by his constituents who are going to vote for Brandon Herrera,\u201d said Rep. Bob Good, the leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, whom Gonzales referred to as one of the \u201cscumbags\u201d in Congress. Gonzales said if he wins Tuesday, he plans to respond in kind by campaigning in the districts of Good and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, both of whom are backing Herrera and also led the charge to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership last fall. Gonzales said that after Tuesday he will seek to purge the party of mischief-making members. \u201cI plan to spend a lot of time in Pensacola,\u201d Gonzales said, referring to the city in Gaetz\u2019s Florida Panhandle. \u201cI plan to spend a lot of time in Virginia and some of these other places. So I think my race is only the beginning, right?\u00a0You can send everything you got at me. You\u2019re never going to beat me, right? You\u2019re just not.\u201d Herrera declined to be interviewed for this story. Money pours into Texas race Gonzales\u2019 massive district \u2014 which spans the border with Mexico \u2014 has emerged as one of the most expensive House primaries in the country, with nearly $8 million spent on TV ads. His situation is part of a larger trend of House GOP members seeking to purge their own colleagues in their primaries, even though that has long been viewed as a serious breach of protocol. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0never good to be shooting inside the tent,\u201d said Gonzales, 43, a military veteran who has been in Congress since 2021. So far, hard-right candidates have been unsuccessful in defeating their more moderate opponents this cycle.\u00a0An effort to take out\u00a0GOP Rep. Don Bacon in Nebraska failed earlier this month when\u00a0he defeated his conservative challenger,\u00a0Dan Frei, who was endorsed by Good. In Illinois, GOP Rep. Mike Bost won after Gaetz tried to prop up his challenger, a fight that prompted Speaker Mike Johnson to lobby former President Donald Trump\u00a0to intervene on Bost\u2019s behalf. In South Carolina, members of the House Freedom Caucus are rallying around conservative state Rep. Adam Morgan, who is trying to knock off Rep. William Timmons in the\u00a0June 11\u00a0primary.\u00a0In Virginia, center-right Republicans and McCarthy are seeking some payback in helping Republican challenger John McGuire ahead of the\u00a0June 18\u00a0primary against Good, one of\u00a0eight Republicans\u00a0who voted to oust McCarthy last fall. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s race, Republican backers of Gonzales are optimistic, but low-turnout runoffs make such contests hard to handicap. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to add more to the dysfunction in the House,\u201d said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, referring to a potential Herrera victory. \u201cI don\u2019t see him being a productive member of Congress, and (he) will be an agent of chaos.\u201d Rep. Richard Hudson, the chairman of National Republican Congressional Committee, added: \u201cI wish Republicans would focus on beating Democrats and growing the majority. You know, any time an incumbent is in a runoff primary we\u2019re concerned, but I\u2019m very confident Tony will prevail.\u201d GOP Rep. Max Miller of Ohio said he thinks it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cdisgusting\u201d\u00a0that Gaetz is targeting Gonzales. \u201cYou have over 200 Republicans that need to work together every single day,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re in an environment where you have to work with somebody on legislation to move the country forward in a pragmatic and sensible way, and they\u2019re literally trying to take you out to replace you because \u2026 you\u2019re not hard-core enough. What the hell does that even mean anymore?\u201d Gonzales\u2019\u00a0vote in 2022 for a gun safety law that was enacted in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting is in part to blame for GOP hardliners\u2019\u00a0beef with\u00a0him.\u00a0Gonzales\u00a0also tangled with his right flank as they were negotiating the House Republicans\u2019 immigration proposal, even as he voted for the final product. And in 2022, the Texas Republican voted with a minority of his conference to codify same-sex marriage. \u201cTony Gonzales called the tough border protections that we were looking for un-Christian; that\u2019s not how voters feel in his district,\u201d Gaetz said. Asked about Gonzales calling him a \u201cscumbag,\u201d Gaetz said: \u201cSo, you know, the personal insults against me, that\u2019s not going to solve any problems for voters in Texas.\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, a fellow Texas Republican who sparred with Gonzales over border legislation, said he is staying neutral in the primary. Asked about Gonzales, Roy said: \u201cHe\u2019s made some comments that I don\u2019t think are particularly helpful.\u201d One of those comments \u2014 calling his detractors \u201cscumbags\u201d \u2014 was something that \u201creally upset\u201d GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, who endorsed Herrera and who described Gonzales\u2019 comments as \u201cgarbage\u201d that is \u201cso beneath the conference.\u201d \u201cYou got the largely\u00a0conservative\u00a0House Freedom\u00a0Caucus, going up against moderates in the conference,\u201d Crane told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re outnumbered. \u2026 That\u2019s why my voters sent me up here to try and change the way this town works. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change it with guys like Tony.\u201d Gonzales said he doesn\u2019t take back his harsh words against some of his GOP colleagues. \u201cNot all of them are rewarding citizens, productive members of society here. And some of them are scumbags. I mentioned a couple of them. There\u2019s probably a laundry list of folks,\u201d Gonzales said, declining to name other names. He added: \u201cSome of these people that are running throughout the country, they\u2019re not MAGA folks. \u2026 Bob Good, he\u2019s not a MAGA guy that\u2019s supporting my opponent, and some other people \u2026 they\u2019re basically libertarians or anarchists or they just want to see the place burn down.\u201d \u2018I will never bow down to these people\u2019 Gonzales was in El Paso when he received a text about the mass shooting that killed\u00a019 children and two teachers. He drove to Uvalde that night after speaking with the sheriff there. Two years later, Gonzales said he thinks a lot needs to change but argues there have been positive developments. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is this: You can do all the things that they want you to do, and it will never be enough. And I will never bow down to these people. I will always do what I think is right,\u201d\u00a0Gonzales said. Herrera, a gun rights activist with a YouTube\u00a0channel with millions of subscribers, has seized on Gonzales\u2019 vote on the gun safety bill in his campaign to oust Gonzales in the\u00a0runoff, arguing it\u2019s an infringement of the Second Amendment. But Gonzales said he was \u201cgetting calls from people nonstop\u201d in the wake of the Uvalde massacre. \u201cThe calls were, \u2018Tony, you have to do something, but don\u2019t take\u00a0my guns away,\u2019\u201d he said. Ultimately, what transpired was a compromise that fell short of restricting weapons and imposing universal background checks but authorized grants for states to bolster \u201cred flag\u201d laws; included money for school safety and mental health programs; expanded background checks for gun purchasers under 21; and toughened gun-trafficking penalties. Gonzales said he \u201cgot a lot of flak\u201d for his support. \u201cCrazy people should not have access to guns, period,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, people are angry and they\u2019re angry for a reason,\u201d Gonzales said of voters. \u201cBut are they going to be angry and then they want to see outrage by setting stuff on fire? Or are we going to help quell that anger by delivering results? That is what\u2019s at stake, not only in this race, but \u2026 other races across the country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sheden Tesfaldet and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/politics/tony-gonzales-uvalde-congress-runoff/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_appeals-court-jury-pool-january-6", "text": "A federal appeals court, including two Donald Trump appointees, ruled Tuesday that the Democratic-lean of Washington, DC\u2019s, population does not make its jury pool too biased to try a January 6 Capitol rioter case. Thomas Webster, a former New York Police Department officer who\u00a0was found guilty in\u00a02022 of assaulting a police officer during the riot, had challenged his conviction on that and other grounds. His legal arguments echoed public comments about the partisan bent of DC from\u00a0Trump\u00a0and his allies about the criminal case the former president faces in the nation\u2019s capital for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The DC US Circuit Court of Appeals, in an opinion written by Barack Obama-appointed Judge Patricia Millett and joined by Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees, rejected the version of the argument put forward by Webster. \u201cWebster asserts that the District overwhelmingly voted for President Biden and historically votes for Democratic candidates. \u2026 That may be,\u201d Millett wrote. \u201cBut the political inclinations of a populace writ large say nothing about an individual\u2019s ability to serve impartially in adjudicating the criminal conduct of an individual.\u201d She pointed to the prosecution of aides to President Richard Nixon for their role in the Watergate cover-up, and wrote that the appeals court \u201cheld that District juries could impartially adjudicate other criminal cases arising out of political matters, including Watergate.\u201d Her opinion also brushed off polling data Webster had offered about the sentiments that the district jury\u2019s pool have about the Capitol attack. The survey of 400 people registered to vote in DC found that they had a \u201cdecidedly negative impression of individuals arrested in conjunction with the activities of January 6, 2021.\u201d The DC Circuit said that \u201cWebster\u2019s focus on the jury pool\u2019s opinion of January 6th and its perpetrators misses the point.\u201d \u201cWe expect jurors to view significant criminal events in their hometown with an unapproving eye, whether it is the January 6th attack on the Capitol, a murder, or an armed robbery spree,\u201d Millett wrote. \u201cGeneralized disapproval of criminal conduct \u2014 even the specific conduct at issue in a defendant\u2019s case \u2014 says nothing about a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial in deciding whether a particular individual committed a crime or not.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/appeals-court-jury-pool-january-6/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The change in policy will allow independent private sector entrepreneurs in Cuba to import food, equipment and other goods, the officials explained. It will also make it easier for remittances to be sent to Cuba and help to stem irregular migration from the island, they added. \u201cThe administration is now fully implementing the May 2022 commitments to the Cuban people. We believe that the growth of an independent, entrepreneurial private sector in Cuba is fully aligned with our values and is the best hope for generating economic development and employment in Cuba,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cAnd the growth of this sector is also consistent with the President\u2019s guidance to implement measures that will benefit the Cuban people while continuing to minimize resources to the Cuban government.\u201d In 2022,\u00a0the Biden administration announced\u00a0a series of policy changes aimed at supporting the Cuban people, including reinstating the Cuban Family Reunification parole Program and increasing consular services and visa processing.

The announcement comes about six months before the US presidential elections and how Biden navigates Cuba could carry political implications, given he lost Florida to\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump in the 2020 election.

The actual facts of the \u201cauthorized to shoot me\u201d allegation, as reported by CNN, are these: A recently unsealed document outlining the FBI\u2019s procedure for searching Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022 for classified documents included standard language about the \u201cuse of force\u201d in searches. From CNN\u2019s report by Tierney Sneed,\u00a0Katelyn Polantz,\u00a0Holmes Lybrand\u00a0and\u00a0Hannah Rabinowitz: The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. What actually happened? The FBI coordinated the search with the Secret Service and took pains to be as low profile as possible, according to testimony on Capitol Hill last year by Stephen D\u2019Antuono, former FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington field office. \u201cWe made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues,\u201d D\u2019Antuono said. \u201cWe\u2019re not banging down any doors. We weren\u2019t bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right.\u201d Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago when the search occurred, and he actually announced the search was occurring with a post to social media. Read CNN\u2019s original report on the search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. Those details don\u2019t fit into the subject line of an email, and they certainly don\u2019t fit Trump\u2019s narrative that he is being persecuted. The more important headline from the unsealed documents, according to CNN\u2019s report from Tuesday, was that a federal judge in Washington, DC, found \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of crimes before Trump was charged with mishandling classified data. The judge, Beryl Howell, cited the discovery of additional documents with classified markings found in Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago bedroom months after the FBI search. Trump is a master sensationalist, so place the email subject line where he says he\u2019s in physical harm within his oeuvre of over-the-top and untrue allegations. How to get people to open fundraising emails The email address where I get fundraising pitches from politicians received seven such messages from Trump on Tuesday. On any given day, there will likely be at least one that is misleading. Like this one from Tuesday: \u201cI\u2019ve made a final decision. What do you think of my VP choice?\u201d (In truth, Trump has not announced who his running mate will be). Other subject lines are pushing merch: \u201cYOU, have you seen my mugshot? I put it on a mug for you.\u201d (In related news, Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is now selling his own brand of coffee.) There are sweepstakes to win trips to Las Vegas and London. (You can enter to win with a $20.24 contribution). Trump\u2019s allegations about the FBI document were not just contained in the fundraising email. In a post to social media, he weaved the \u201cdeadly force\u201d allegation in with other, ongoing complaints: The temperature in his Manhattan criminal trial courtroom was too cold. Trump thinks President Joe Biden is unfit for office, and he thinks Biden\u2019s Cabinet should remove him from the presidency. The social media post looked like this: \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE. NOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d The truth is that voters will get to weigh in on Biden\u2019s fitness for office. The New York criminal trial judge, Juan Merchan, explained to Trump at trial that raising the thermostat would turn the ice box into an oven. And there\u2019s absolutely no indication whatsoever that anyone in Biden\u2019s Cabinet is now considering or ever has considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. On that last point, the same cannot be said for Trump \u2013 some of whose Cabinet members did discuss but did not act on using the 25th Amendment after the riot at the Capitol in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/donald-trump-fundraising-email-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "politics"}}
