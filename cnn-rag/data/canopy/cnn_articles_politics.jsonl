Russia is \u201cundertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,\u201d the official said, adding that Russia\u2019s preference for US presidential candidates has not changed from previous election cycles. The official declined to elaborate, but US intelligence previously assessed that in the 2020 US election, Russia conducted a range of influence operations to denigrate Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy and support Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. Tuesday\u2019s briefing was perhaps the clearest public statement yet from US intelligence agencies on their assessment of how Russia, China and Iran may try to influence a highly polarized American public during a 2024 election. \u201cRussia is a preeminent threat. Iran is a chaos agent, and China is holding fire on the presidential race,\u201d the ODNI official said. \u201cWe assess China, for now, does not plan to influence the outcome of the presidential race, because it sees little gain in choosing between two parties that it perceives as both seeking to contain Beijing,\u201d the official said. All three countries have denied trying to interfere in or influence US elections. ODNI officials did not reveal many specific examples of what they see as Russian election influence activity, but they said it has included familiar tactics such as amplifying influential US voices online to promote the Kremlin\u2019s agenda. Artificial intelligence is making the job easier. AI allows Russian operatives to mimic an American Southern or Midwestern accent in ways that native Russian speakers would fail to, the ODNI official said. Separately on Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the disruption of nearly a thousand social media accounts that officials said Russia operatives were using to pose as US residents and parrot Kremlin propaganda about the war in Ukraine. Iran, meanwhile, \u201cseeks to stoke social divisions and undermine confidence in the US democratic institutions around the elections,\u201d the ODNI official said at the press briefing. \u201cIran has demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting US political and social tensions through a variety of means, including social media.\u201d Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the United States related to the\u00a0conflict in Gaza,\u00a0US\u00a0Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in a statement on Tuesday. China\u2019s \u2018unwieldy\u2019 foreign influence apparatus Historically, China has shown less interest than Russia in sowing divisions among Americans during US elections, according to intelligence officials. But there have been recent indications that Chinese operatives have become more willing to directly target American voters. Since 2020, senior Chinese officials have issued broad directives to Chinese operatives to \u201cintensify efforts to influence US policy and public opinion in China\u2019s favor,\u201d and senior Chinese officials have aimed to \u201cmagnify US societal divisions,\u201d according to a US intelligence assessment\u00a0declassified\u00a0in December. Those influence efforts have included using fake social media accounts to attack US politicians online. The subject has become a source of tension in US-China relations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the\u00a0two men met\u00a0in November, CNN previously reported. But US officials have been skeptical of Xi\u2019s ability to control the vast Chinese bureaucracy when it comes to potential election influence efforts. \u201cEven if Beijing sets limits on its activities \u2026 the PRC\u2019s influence apparatus is very large and at times unwieldy, and individuals that are not under its direct supervision may attempt to influence election activities that they perceive are in line with Beijing\u2019s goals,\u201d the ODNI official said Tuesday, using an acronym for the Chinese government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/russia-2024-election-influence-operations-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_trump-new-york-conviction-argument", "text": "Donald Trump urged the judge in his New York hush money case to dismiss his conviction in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on presidential immunity last month, according to a new court filing. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in a 55-page filing that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be vacated because the district attorney\u2019s office relied on evidence at trial related to Trump\u2019s official acts as president, which Trump\u2019s lawyers asserted should not have been permitted in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent immunity decision. \u201cIn order to vindicate the Presidential immunity doctrine, and protect the interests implicated by its underpinnings, the jury\u2019s verdicts must be vacated and the Indictment dismissed,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote to Judge Juan Merchan. The Manhattan district attorney \u201cviolated the Presidential immunity doctrine and the Supremacy Clause by relying on evidence relating to President Trump\u2019s official acts in 2017 and 2018 to unfairly prejudice President Trump in this unprecedented and unfounded prosecution relating to purported business records,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cMuch of the unconstitutional official-acts evidence concerned actions taken pursuant to \u2018core\u2019 Executive power for which \u2018absolute\u2019 immunity applies.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment for this story. Last week, Merchan postponed Trump\u2019s sentencing to allow Trump to file his motion to dismiss the guilty verdict. The district attorney\u2019s office will respond later this month, and Merchan said he will decide the matter in September, with a potential sentencing scheduled on September 18, if necessary. Merchan had initially set Thursday as the day that Trump would be sentenced following his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, when Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. But that schedule was scrapped after the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity last month, in which the court\u2019s conservative wing found that\u00a0presidents have absolute immunity\u00a0for core official acts. In their filing, Trump\u2019s lawyers pointed to testimony at trial \u2013 including from White House officials Hope Hicks and Madeleine Westerhout\u2013 they argued should not have come before the jury, as well as tweets he sent while president. All of Hicks\u2019s testimony concerning events in 2018, when she was serving as the White House Communications Director, concerned official acts based on core Article II authority for which President Trump is entitled to absolute immunity,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys argued. \u201cTrump specifically forbids prosecutors from offering \u2018testimony\u2019 from a President\u2019s \u2018advisers\u2019 for the purpose of \u2018probing the official act.\u2019\u201d The filing says Westerhout was forced to testify about national security matters and her work for Trump, calling prosecutors\u2019 questioning \u201cinvasive.\u201d \u201cThis invasive compelled testimony included information regarding President Trump\u2019s official-capacity \u2018work habits,\u2019 \u2018preferences,\u2019 \u2018relationships and contacts,\u2019 and \u2018social media\u2019 practices at the White House,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers argued. Trump\u2019s attorneys pointed to a March 2018 text message that Westerhout sent Hicks while they were White House advisers working on Trump\u2019s behalf: \u201cHey- the president wants to know if you called David pecker again.\u201d In addition, Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote that Trump, while president, used his Twitter account as \u201cone of the White House\u2019s main vehicles for conducting official business.\u201d \u201cMore broadly, permitting prosecutors to use a President\u2019s public statements on matters of public concern in criminal proceedings would chill the President\u2019s willingness and ability to communicate with the public,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat would result in an impermissible \u2018intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch\u2019 and the \u2018enfeebling of the Presidency.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys also criticized the district attorney\u2019s office for not waiting for the Supreme Court before taking the case to trial. \u201cAt bottom, the \u2018pressure campaign\u2019 theory turned on DANY\u2019s efforts to assign a criminal motive to actions that President Trump took in 2018 as the Commander in Chief responsible for the entire Executive Branch,\u201d his lawyers wrote. The Manhattan district attorney \u201curged this Court to front-run the Supreme Court on a federal constitutional issue with grave implications for the operation of the federal government and the relationships between state and federal officials. The record is clear: DANY was wrong, very wrong.\u201d Following the Supreme Court ruling, Trump\u2019s lawyers filed a letter earlier this month to the judge asking permission to file the motion to set aside the verdict. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s team responded earlier this month by asserting that Trump\u2019s argument was \u201cwithout merit,\u201d but also that they did not oppose postponing the sentencing while Merchan decided Trump\u2019s motion. The judge announced that same day that he would allow the two sides to file briefs this month and that he would rule on the matter on September 6. Trump\u2019s sentencing would be postponed until September 18, Merchan wrote \u2013 \u201cif such is still necessary.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s reply to Trump is due on July 24.

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this.

We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night,\u201d Welch said in a Washington Post op-ed that noted his \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the president. \u201cI understand why President Biden\u00a0wants to run. He saved us from\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0once and wants to do it again,\u201d Welch continued. \u201cBut he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so.

{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_nato-leaders-affirm-ukraine-future-nato", "text": "NATO leaders jointly affirmed Wednesday that \u201cUkraine\u2019s future is in NATO\u201d and its path is \u201cirreversible,\u201d as they pledged long-term support for Kyiv. The leaders did not provide a specific timeline for Ukraine to join the defensive alliance. Instead, they said they would \u201cbe in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree, and conditions are met.\u201d \u201cWe welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms,\u201d the leaders said in the Washington Summit Declaration, released after a meeting of NATO\u2019s North Atlantic Council Wednesday. \u201cAs Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,\u201d the declaration said. The declaration outlined the alliance\u2019s ongoing support for Kyiv, including previous announcements on new air defense systems and the establishment of the \u201cNATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners.\u201d The description of Ukraine\u2019s path as \u201cirreversible\u201d comes after months of diplomatic negotiations in the lead up to the Washington Summit and was a point of contention among the allies. Prior to the release of the declaration, some diplomats had argued that it was not enough to just describe the path as \u201cirreversible,\u201d but that there must be strong support undergirding that description. Moving the training and equipment coordination under the auspices of NATO has been seen by many as a way to ensure ongoing support for Kyiv in the case of the reelection of former US President Donald Trump. Officials have quietly expressed concerns about what a second Trump presidency could mean for the defensive alliance and for the military support for Kyiv as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine continues with little sign of a military or diplomatic conclusion. There is \u201ca growing and understandable doubt about the future of Western support\u201d for Ukraine, a European diplomat said last week. The aim of the NSATU \u201cis to place security assistance to Ukraine on an enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable, and coherent support,\u201d the declaration said, noting that it \u201cwill not, under international law, make NATO a party to the conflict.\u201d \u201cIt will support the transformation of Ukraine\u2019s defence and security forces, enabling its further integration with NATO,\u201d the declaration said. The leaders also announced \u201ca pledge of long-term support\u201d to Ukraine, with the intention  \u201cto provide a minimum baseline funding of \u20ac40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail.\u201d The declaration also expressed \u201cprofound concern\u201d over the \u201cdeepening strategic partnership\u201d between China and Russia \u201cand their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order.\u201d The declaration calls Beijing \u201ca decisive enabler of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine through its so-called \u2018no limits\u2019 partnership and its large-scale support for Russia\u2019s defence industrial base,\u201d and calls on China, \u201cas a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia\u2019s war effort.\u201d It noted that China \u201ccannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\u201d echoing the growing public concern from the US and European allies about Beijing\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The declaration also said China \u201ccontinues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security\u201d through \u201csustained malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation.\u201d It recognized the Indo-Pacific as \u201cimportant for NATO,\u201d but did not suggest a strong role for the alliance in this area. \u201cWe welcome the continued contributions of our Asia-Pacific partners to Euro-Atlantic security,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defence, countering disinformation, and technology.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/nato-leaders-affirm-ukraine-future-nato/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_biden-fate-political-career", "text": "The high-stakes week ahead is critical to whether President Joe Biden\u2019s defiance will save his reelection bid or whether Democrats who question his capacity to serve a second term will succeed in pressuring him to step aside. While only a handful of House Democrats have\u00a0publicly called for the president to end his campaign, there is deep disquiet inside the party at the possibility that Biden, who swept\u00a0Donald Trump out of the White House four years ago, could ruin his legacy\u00a0and throw the country into uncharted political territory by\u00a0failing to deter voters from sending\u00a0his rival back in the Oval Office after November\u2019s election. Biden on Monday emphatically said he was staying in the race. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter to congressional Democrats. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Democratic anxiety reverberated through a call that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hosted for his conference Sunday afternoon. Some members said Biden should go, and there\u2019s a consensus among dozens of party lawmakers that he needs to step aside, sources told CNN. But a meeting that Sen. Mark Warner planned for Monday to consider the president\u2019s future is now scrapped, and the Virginia Democrat has not decided whether he thinks Biden should step aside, a source said. Several key party heavyweights said on Sunday morning news shows that the president needs to do far more to ease skepticism among voters. \u201cI think this week is going to be really critical for him to answer those remaining questions,\u201d Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The president nevertheless insisted in a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania on Sunday that \u201cI\u2019m up for the job!\u201d Biden reinforced his refusal to cede the Democratic nomination he earned through a largely unopposed primary run in a high-stakes interview with ABC News on Friday, warning only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could compel him to end his campaign. But the interview only reinforced Democrats\u2019 panic that followed his devastating debate performance last month over his chances of beating Republican presumptive nominee Trump. The interview also raised further questions over Biden\u2019s health as he seeks a new term that would end when he is 86 and over whether he understands the gravity of his political plight as he trails Trump in polls. The turmoil surrounding Biden\u2019s future is creating a grim mood inside the White House, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee reported. West Wing staffers are rattled by the president\u2019s debate performance and the coverage of the president\u2019s subsequent struggles, although support for his reelection bid remains strong in the building. A moment of soul-searching for the Democratic Party Among the key questions now is whether a critical mass of lawmakers will unite to try to convince the president to stand aside. \u2022 If that happens, would senior party leaders be willing to go to the\u00a0president\u00a0and argue that his position is unsustainable?\u2022 And even if they did, would Biden \u2013 who has earned the votes of millions of Democrats to secure the nomination and who maintains he is fully fit to serve a new term\u00a0\u2013\u00a0agree to cede his campaign?\u2022 If the president remained obdurate at this point, Democrats would face a decision on whether to go public about their views, and many in critical states and districts would have to consider distancing themselves from their own party\u2019s presidential nominee to try to save themselves in November. There is an almost surreal quality to the frenzied political debate as Biden digs in. It would be an extraordinary twist to an already remarkable year in which Republicans will nominate a convicted felon and\u00a0twice-impeached former president if Democrats decline at the last minute to nominate a sitting president, who most believe has had a successful term,\u00a0over concerns that he can\u2019t win. Passing on Biden would also\u00a0mark\u00a0a humiliating coda to a political career that has spanned half a century, and the president would likely regard himself as the victim of scathing betrayal. If Democrats do push him aside, they\u2019d create a high-risk scenario unprecedented in modern history. They\u2019d have to decide whether to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 which has already begun in some quarters \u2013 or whether to stage a lightning process to pick an unvetted neophyte new nominee. There would be no guarantee that a new standard-bearer would do better than Biden, who has already beaten Trump once. But the fact many want to try shows the intensity of alarm in the party and the potency of the image of an aged and sometimes incoherent president blazed on the minds of 50 million television viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta. In a worrying sign for Biden, even senior party figures who are normally supportive and laud the achievements of his term argue that he must do far more to convince voters that he is up to the demands of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the president\u2019s performance at the debate has raised questions for voters, not questions about his character or his decency or who he cares about or who he fights for, but questions as to whether this is still the old Joe Biden,\u201d Murphy said on\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0\u201cState of the Union.\u201d He told Dana Bash that the president needed to get out and \u201cdo a town hall, that he do a press conference,\u00a0(to) show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden.\u201d Rep. Adam\u00a0Schiff also raised concerns. Like Murphy, Schiff poured praise on Biden\u2019s achievements and lacerated Trump. But he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the debate performance raised concerns among voters about whether Biden had the capacity to win \u201can existential race.\u201d Given that Trump is a convicted criminal, the California Democrat said that the election shouldn\u2019t be close and that the president\u2019s age is the only reason it is. \u201cHe should seek out people with some distance and objectivity. He should seek pollsters who are not his own pollsters. He should take a moment to make the best-informed judgment. And if the judgment is run, then run hard and beat that SOB.\u201d The comments of the two senior Democrats underscore the disconnect in the party. While there is alarm among many on Capitol Hill and a desire for the president to do far more in unscripted situations to prove his fitness, Biden himself has already ruled out ending his reelection bid. He refused to answer a question in the ABC News interview about what he would do if leaders such as Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told him that he could harm Democrats in Congress if he stayed in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Biden said. But the president is getting strong support from his allies in the Congressional Black Caucus.\u00a0Ohio\u00a0Rep. Joyce\u00a0Beatty, a former chair of the CBC, said Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be going rogue against our own president.\u201d And voters at the Essence Festival in New Orleans voiced confidence in Biden and resisted calls for him to end his campaign, CNN\u2019s Ebony Davis and Eva McKend reported. The\u00a0ABC News interview aside, the president is not throwing himself into the intense scrutiny of repeated and spontaneous political events that even many of his supporters want to see. On Sunday, the president gave a speech in a Black church in Philadelphia and addressed campaign workers in a short, off-the-cuff speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He did spend considerable time working a rope line in stifling heat. And later this week, he\u2019s expected to hold a news conference at the NATO summit he\u2019s hosting in Washington, which will be another critical barometer of his faculties. But many Democrats want him to do more amid fears that his position is so precarious that he will not only lose the White House but that he could also drag down his party, allowing Republicans to win back the House and retain the Senate. With the Supreme Court cementing an era of ultra-conservative jurisprudence, many Democrats are openly scared of the consequences of a second, unrestrained Trump presidency. House Democrats on Sunday vented their frustration about Biden\u2019s troubles and the impact they could have on winning back the House, a possibility that many members had been optimistic about until the debate. \u201cIt was pretty brutal,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation among House leaders. No decisions about demands for a White House meeting or about the possibility of sending a letter to Biden are expected to be made before the full Democratic caucus meets Tuesday, aides said. A source who was on the Sunday call told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee that Jeffries has not taken a position on what should happen. But the Tuesday meeting looms as a fateful moment for the president. Concern about Biden\u2019s ability to perform on the campaign trail and the long-term implications of the debate remain deep, despite the legacy of a first term in which his legislative record matches or surpasses that of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson. Rep. Gerry Connolly, for instance, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Saturday that he believed what happened was more than \u201ca bad night, and that\u2019s why that image is so indelible on so many minds.\u201d The Virginia Democrat said that while Biden\u2019s performance in the ABC News interview was largely good, there were some troubling aspects. \u201cInvoking God Almighty as the only intervention that is going to dissuade him from going forward, I hope Joe Biden didn\u2019t really mean that,\u201d Connolly said. Biden hits the trail Biden sought to squash speculation about his future by seeking to project a picture of vigor on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, a state that he must keep in his column in November to keep his hopes of victory alive. The president reflected on faith and the trials it can help surmount at a stop at Philadelphia\u2019s Mount Airy Church of God in Christ. \u201cWe\u2019re all imperfect beings. We don\u2019t know where or what faith will deliver us to or when,\u201d he said, while appearing to read from prepared notes. Black Democratic voters helped to rescue Biden\u2019s primary campaign in 2020 and to put him in the White House. He has been beset by polls in this cycle suggesting Trump is making inroads in a community that usually votes overwhelming for Democratic presidential candidates. Later in the day, Biden moved on to the state capital of Harrisburg, in the company of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a\u00a0Democratic\u00a0rising star\u00a0spoken of as a possible alternative nominee. Biden also traveled with Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, one of the most vehement supporters of his continued reelection campaign, and his old friend Sen. Bob Casey, who is in a tough reelection race, completed the impression of the commonwealth\u2019s top Democrats protecting his back. \u201cThis election is going to be about blocking, tackling simple, basic politics, simple. It\u2019s going to be a matter of how many signs we get out, how many doors we knock on, how many calls we make and how many requests we answer,\u201d Biden told supporters. His campaign has already announced that he plans to campaign in another vital swing state, Michigan, on Friday, following\u00a0this week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington. Hosting world leaders will allow Biden to highlight his credentials as a statesman and one of the most significant aspects of his term \u2014 his reinvigoration and expansion of the Western alliance and the steeling of US allies to meet the threat posed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. If he can successfully navigate the event without more controversy, the focus may begin to turn away from his perceived liabilities and back toward Trump, who is expected to unveil his vice presidential nominee at or ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. By the time Biden is back in the spotlight, there will be even less time ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August for his critics to push any alternative nominee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/biden-fate-political-career/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_chicago-donors-fundraiser-convention", "text": "Democratic donors are deeply concerned about President Joe Biden\u2019s viability as a candidate as the party continues to wrestle with the path forward \u2014 and holding back big checks, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. \u201cEverything is frozen because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen. Everyone is in wait and see mode,\u201d one Democratic strategist told CNN, noting that donors are hyper-focused on what Biden is doing, including interviews and his news conference Thursday. Donors often operate behind the scenes and, according to sources, have grown increasingly anxious about Biden\u2019s candidacy following his halting debate performance last month. And on Wednesday, George Clooney, who had been among Biden\u2019s biggest supporters and donors in Hollywood, took the remarkable step of publicly calling for him to bow out of the presidential race. The Clooney op-ed, the strategist said, is \u201cgoing to sting.\u201d Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments on MSNBC Wednesday morning also raised fresh doubts and ricocheted among donors. Pelosi\u00a0told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d \u201cMajor donations have slowed remarkably since the debate,\u201d a Democratic fundraiser told CNN, adding that small dollar donations are proceeding at pace, but noted the campaign is too vast to live on small donations alone. A Biden campaign official told CNN that July was the best start to any month ever for grassroots fundraising. They added that several donors maxed out in the past few days and that the Biden-Harris campaign had several fundraisers across the country this month alone. Earlier this week, Biden tried to reassure donors in a call, maintaining that he\u2019s staying in the race and arguing he\u2019s still the best candidate to beat Republican rival Donald Trump. \u201cMy one job is to beat Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said, according to one of the participants on the\u00a0call, who said\u00a0Biden\u00a0thanked\u00a0donors and renewed his pledge to keep the fight alive. But that hasn\u2019t calmed everyone\u2019s nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough go,\u201d one source familiar with the fundraising situation said. \u201cIn the short term, the money is a challenge, but it is a fluid situation.\u201d The incoming money is \u201cdrying up,\u201d another source close to fundraising efforts told CNN, describing\u00a0donors as very, very frustrated, and very, very worried. That\u2019s already come through in fundraisers held after the debate: A fundraiser held at New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s home following the debate raised $3.7 million \u2013 less than half of the haul raised at a pre-debate fundraiser held at the Virginia home of former Gov. Terry McAuliffe the week before the debate. Top Chicago donors halting convention fundraising lunch for high-dollar contributors Meanwhile, organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. In the immediate wake of Biden\u2019s debate performance, organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed given the continued erosion of support for Biden\u2019s candidacy. The event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, was expected to rally support among the party\u2019s loyal and well-heeled locals in a show of support for the big event in their backyard. While the lunch itself was expected to bring in less than $1 million for the campaign, the mood of the participants \u2014 many of whom had given millions to Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign and associated entities \u2014 serves as a warning sign among some deep-blue corners of the donor class. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule. Nearly two weeks after the debate, some Democratic donors continue to sound public warnings that their party could lose the White House in November if Biden remains the nominee and say they are increasingly concerned about his dug-in defiance. The president has insisted he will remain in the race and expressed frustration\u00a0with \u201cthe elites\u201d calling for him to withdraw from the race. Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer\u00a0who recently called on fellow Democratic donors\u00a0to withhold contributions until Biden steps down, told CNN in an email Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cpretty steadfast\u201d in that view. \u201cI maintain that Joe Biden is an excellent president, and I\u2019m saddened that the intraparty language is attack/defend/retreat instead of a thoughtful and considered debate about where we are and how to get to where we need to be,\u201d Lindelof said. \u201cI think the characterization that the only folks asking for that conversation are \u2018elites\u2019 ignores the polling and the tens of millions of Americans who have been saying they were deeply concerned about our nominee for awhile now,\u201d he added. Maggie Kulyk, a Democratic donor who runs a wealth-management firm, said her view that Biden needs to step down is shared by \u201cpeople I talk to all the time \u2013 friends, clients, etc. \u201cTo a person, they all say the same thing, that he shouldn\u2019t be at the top of the ticket,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWashington politicians or someone with some leverage needs to grow a spine and tell the truth that\u2019s in plain sight,\u201d she added, that Biden is dealing with \u201cobvious cognitive issues.\u201d \u201cThis sort of waiting around for (Biden) to make a big stumble again as an excuse, to me, seems ludicrous,\u201d Kulyk said. \u201cThe debate was the thing. We saw it.\u201d Kulyk sits on the board of the Women Donors Network but said she was not speaking on behalf of the contributor group. Democrats stunned by last 24 hours Many anxious Democrats who have been holding their breath and waiting to see what happens to Biden\u2019s reelection campaign have been stunned by the past 24 hours. One widely shared view had been that everything was likely to come to a head after this week\u2019s NATO conference that the US is hosting just blocks away from the White House. Instead, devastating headlines have come out in rapid succession as Biden has been juggling various engagements on the global stage. \u201cThis seems to be moving more rapidly than I thought,\u201d one senior Democrat said. The news of the canceled fundraiser in Chicago came hours after Clooney called on the president to bow out of the race, just weeks after the actor headlined a major fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection campaign. Clooney wrote that the Biden that he saw during a June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \u201cwas not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020.\u201d \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney added, referencing Biden\u2019s faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN. Biden\u2019s team is currently planning to host fundraisers in Austin, Denver, and two in California \u2014 one in Laguna Beach and another in Northern California \u2014 in July, according to a source familiar with the plans. Donors elsewhere in the country\u00a0have told CNN\u00a0their events are on hold until Biden\u2019s path is clearer. John Morgan, a Florida trial attorney and longtime Biden supporter, had been working with the campaign to host a fundraiser in the state likely in early September, but he said this week that the event is \u201call up in the air.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even bother them,\u201d he said\u00a0about\u00a0reaching out to campaign officials\u00a0on\u00a0the status of the event. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call them because they have bigger fish to fry than an event in Florida in September. They\u2019ve got to get past all the naysayers.\u201d For his part, Morgan said he remains committed to backing Biden and is willing to hold a fundraiser \u201conly if he\u2019s the candidate.\u201d \u201cSome of the elite donor class is cutting and running. That\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Morgan said. One long-time Democratic fundraiser said it\u2019s too soon to tell whether Biden is doing enough to stem the concerns of contributors but was relieved that there had not been a \u201csnowball\u201d of elected officials in Washington calling on Biden to quit the race this week once they returned from their July 4\u00a0recess. That said, the person added, \u201cI\u2019ve not made any calls or requests (for donations) in the last week and a half \u2026 because he\u2019s got to let some of this die down.\u201d For its part, the Biden campaign has touted a flood of recent online financial support and the substantial infrastructure it already has built in battleground states to argue it will have the ground game and resources to compete effectively this fall. The campaign said it raised $38 million in the four days after the debate, including $30 million from grassroots contributors. Additionally, Peter Lowy, a former retail executive, on Monday delivered the maximum $929,600 contribution to Biden\u2019s joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee, according to the campaign. In a statement, Lowy said \u201cthere is no question about the country\u2019s success\u201d during Biden\u2019s tenure. \u201cThe economy is strong. Unemployment is near historic lows, more than 15 million jobs have been created, the S&P 500 is at an historic high and inflation is now decreasing,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on all of these facts and based on my interactions with the President, when he announced his plan to run for reelection, I was totally supportive. I supported him then, and I support him today.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democrats-nancy-pelosi-biden-nominee", "text": "Two days after President Joe Biden asserted he was \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to staying in the 2024 race, Democrats continue to question his place as their nominee, with the number of lawmakers calling for him to step aside ticking up Wednesday evening. Vermont Sen. Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside as the nominee in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday. Just\u00a010\u00a0congressional Democrats have\u00a0publicly\u00a0called for Biden to step aside, but a larger number are operating under a premise that Biden may still be deliberating, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying Wednesday, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d The comments made by Pelosi, who is known for her precision, confused some members but also\u00a0provided an opening for others, according to conversations with multiple lawmakers and aides. After a group of California House Democrats met in the Capitol Wednesday, many emerged echoing a similar sentiment. \u201cThe president has got to decide what he is going to do,\u201d Democratic Rep. Scott Peters told CNN. When presented with the reality that Biden has stated he plans to remain in the race, Peters responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think the week is over. I think that as more and more data comes in, he\u2019s got to keep his eyes open.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman told CNN that just because Biden has said he made his decision to remain in the race, that does not mean it is final. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman, who has raised concerns about Biden, told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe all understand this as President Biden\u2019s decision. I will just say that good leaders always continue to consider new information and changed circumstances and sometimes make different decisions informed by that. So, this is going to be fluid for a little while.\u201d Even Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina who is a strident Biden supporter, told reporters Wednesday\u00a0he \u201chas no idea\u201d if Biden\u2019s decision to stay in the race is final. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia, told CNN Wednesday when pressed on if he really thought Biden could change his mind, \u201cif you can\u2019t change your mind, you can\u2019t change anything,\u201d adding he has always believed \u201crational people do the right thing.\u201d The high stakes meetings on Capitol Hill\u00a0that kicked off on\u00a0Tuesday also did little to resolve Democratic divisions over Biden\u2019s future. House members leaving a nearly two-hour meeting at the DNC argued they were still working through the process, and various caucuses within the Democratic party \u2014 including lawmakers who represent the most competitive districts \u2014\u00a0have held private meetings with Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has promised to relay concerns to the White House. New York Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, reversed course on Wednesday and went public with his concerns that Biden remaining at the top of the ticket could hurt Democrats\u2019 chances of winning back the House of Representatives. Torres said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cthere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d when two days prior had called the intra-party controversy \u201cself-destructive.\u201d Crystalizing his criticism, Torres said in a statement to CNN \u201cif we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d In just the last two days, Democratic Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Pat Ryan of New York have called on Biden to step aside, bringing the total number of congressional Democrats to make public statements asking Biden to withdraw to 10. During a Senate lunch Tuesday,\u00a0three Democratic senators \u2013 Colorado\u2019s Michael Bennet, Montana\u2019s Jon Tester and Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown - expressed concerns to their colleagues that they didn\u2019t think Biden could beat Trump in a rematch in November. Bennet later on Tuesday became the first Democratic senator to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. On Thursday, the Biden campaign will dispatch top campaign officials\u00a0including\u00a0senior Biden advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, and Biden Campaign Chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon to brief senate Democrats during a special meeting, a sign that questions about Biden\u2019s future are still lingering. Democrats both publicly and privately\u00a0contend that one of the challenges of the moment for them is that they need to see more of the President. \u201cThe President has to be more active, He has to be out there in unscripted situations, answering questions, interacting with voters in order to demonstrate that the debate performance was an anomaly,\u201d independent Maine Sen. Angus King said. Many members told CNN that they will be watching Biden very carefully for the remainder of the week,\u00a0including a high-profile press conference he is scheduled to host on Thursday at NATO. The number three Democrat in the House, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California,\u00a0said Tuesday,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d referring to the upcoming events. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how this plays out,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim Costa of California said. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_trump-allies-project-2025", "text": "Donald Trump has lately made clear he wants little to do with Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that has attracted considerable blowback in his race for the White House. \u201cI have no idea who is behind it,\u201d the former president recently claimed on social media. Many people Trump knows quite well are behind it. Six of his former Cabinet secretaries helped write or collaborated on the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation. Four individuals Trump nominated as ambassadors were also involved, along with several enforcers of his controversial immigration crackdown. And about 20 pages are credited to his first deputy chief of staff. In fact, at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d the project\u2019s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. Dozens more who staffed Trump\u2019s government hold positions with conservative groups advising Project 2025, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime adviser Stephen Miller. These groups also include several lawyers deeply involved in Trump\u2019s attempts to remain in power, such as his impeachment attorney Jay Sekulow and two of the legal architects of his failed bid to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Cleta Mitchell and John Eastman. To quantify the scope of the involvement from Trump\u2019s orbit, CNN reviewed online biographies, LinkedIn profiles and news clippings for more than 1,000 people listed on published directories for the 110 organizations on Project 2025\u2019s advisory board, as well as the 200-plus names credited with working on \u201cMandate for Leadership.\u201d Overall, CNN found nearly 240 people with ties to both Project 2025 and to Trump, covering nearly every aspect of his time in politics and the White House \u2013 from day-to-day foot soldiers in Washington to the highest levels of his government. The number is likely higher because many individuals\u2019 online r\u00e9sum\u00e9s were not available. In addition to people who worked directly for Trump, others who participated in Project 2025 were appointed by the former president to independent positions. For instance, Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr authored an entire chapter of proposed changes to his agency, and Lisa Correnti, an anti-abortion advocate Trump appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, is among the contributors. Several people involved in Project 2025 didn\u2019t serve in the Trump administration but were influential in shaping his first term. One example is former US Attorney Brett Tolman, a leading force behind the former president\u2019s criminal justice reform law who later helped arrange a pardon for Charles Kushner, the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Tolman is listed as a contributor to \u201cMandate for Leadership.\u201d The extensive overlap between Project 2025 and Trump\u2019s universe of allies, advisers and former staff complicates his efforts to distance himself from the work. Trump\u2019s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 doesn\u2019t speak for them amid an intensifying push by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie the Republican standard bearer to the playbook\u2019s more controversial policies. In a statement to CNN, campaign spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez said Trump only endorses the Republican Party platform and the agenda posted on the former president\u2019s website. \u201cTeam Biden and the (Democratic National Committee) are lying and fear-mongering because they have nothing else to offer the American people,\u201d Alvarez said. Heritage plan becomes a political headache Behind Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation, a 51-year-old conservative organization that aligned itself with Trump not long after his 2016 victory. Heritage is led by Kevin Roberts, a Trump ally whom the former president praised as \u201cdoing an unbelievable job\u201d on a February night when they shared the same stage. Heritage conceived Project 2025 to begin planning so a Republican president could hit the ground running after the election. One of its priorities is creating a roadmap for the first 180 days of the new administration to quickly reorient every federal agency around its conservative vision. Described on its website as \u201ca movement-wide effort guided by the conservative cause to address and reform the failings of big government and an undemocratic administrative state,\u201d Project 2025 also aims to recruit and train thousands of people loyal to the conservative movement to fill federal government positions. One organization advising Project 2025, American Accountability Foundation, is also putting together a roster of current federal workers it suspects could impede Trump\u2019s plans for a second term. Heritage is paying the group $100,000 for its work. Many of Project 2025\u2019s priorities are aligned with the former president, especially on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracies. Both Trump and Project 2025 have called for eliminating the Department of Education. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn\u2019t explicitly backed. Within \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d are plans to ban pornography, reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, exclude the morning-after pill and men\u2019s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition, and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. Its voluminous and detailed plans also run counter to Trump\u2019s desire for a streamlined GOP platform absent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle. Roberts recently faced backlash as well for saying in an interview that the country was \u201cin the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\u201d Three days later, Trump posted to Truth Social: \u201cI know nothing about Project 2025.\u201d \u201cI disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\u201d he wrote. In response to Trump\u2019s social media post, a Project 2025 spokesperson told CNN in a statement it \u201cdoes not speak for any candidate or campaign.\u201d \u201cIt is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to use,\u201d the spokesperson said. Trump\u2019s campaign has repeatedly said in recent months that \u201creports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical\u201d and don\u2019t represent the former president\u2019s plans. Project 2025 and similar policy proposals coming from outside Trump\u2019s campaign are \u201cmerely suggestions,\u201d campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in a statement. Vast network of Trump allies However, Trump\u2019s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025 have already encountered credibility challenges. The person overseeing Project 2025, Paul Dans, was a top official in Trump\u2019s White House who has previously said he hopes to work for his former boss again. Shortly after Trump\u2019s Truth Social post last week, Democrats noted a recruitment video for Project 2025 features a Trump campaign spokeswoman. On Tuesday, the Biden campaign posted dozens of examples of connections between Trump and Project 2025. CNN\u2019s review of Project 2025\u2019s contributors also demonstrated the breadth of Trump\u2019s reach through the upper ranks of the vast network of organizations working to move the country in a conservative direction \u2013 from women\u2019s groups and Christian colleges to conservative think tanks in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. New organizations centered around Trump\u2019s political movement, his conspiracy theories around his electoral defeats and his first-term policies are deeply involved in Project 2025 as well. One of the advisory groups, America First Legal, was started by Miller, a key player in forming Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Another is the Center for Renewing America, founded by Russ Vought, former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote for Project 2025 a detailed blueprint for consolidating executive power. Vought recently oversaw the Republican Party committee that drafted the new platform heavily influenced by Trump. In addition to Vought, two other former Trump Cabinet secretaries wrote chapters for \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Three more former department heads \u2013 National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe, acting Transportation Secretary Steven Bradbury and acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella \u2013 are listed as contributors. Project 2025\u2019s proposals for reforming the country\u2019s immigration laws appear heavily influenced by those who helped execute Trump\u2019s early enforcement measures. Former acting US Customs and Border Protection chief Mark Morgan and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Tom Homan \u2013 the faces of Trump\u2019s polarizing policies \u2013 contributed to the project, as did Kathy Nuebel Kovarik, one of the policy advisers pushing to end certain immigrant protections behind the scenes. The Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Department of Homeland Security was written by Ken Cuccinelli, a top official at the department under Trump. Some of Trump\u2019s most contentious and high-profile hires are credited with working on \u201cMandate for Leadership,\u201d including some whose tenures ended under a cloud of controversy. Before Trump adviser Peter Navarro went to prison for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena as part of the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, he wrote a section defending the former president\u2019s trade policies and advocating for punitive tariffs. Other contributors include: Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker who orchestrated a mass firing at the US Agency for Global Media after he was installed by Trump; Frank Wuco, a senior White House adviser who once promoted far-right conspiracies on his talk radio show, including lies about President Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship; former NOAA official David Legates, a notable climate change skeptic investigated for posting dubious research with the White House imprint; and Mari Stull, a wine blogger-turned-lobbyist who left the Trump administration amid accusations she was hunting for disloyal State Department employees. The culmination of their work, spread across 900 pages, touches every corner of the executive branch and would drastically change the federal government as well as everyday life for many Americans. In summarizing the undertaking, Roberts wrote in \u201cMandate for Leadership\u201d that Project 2025 represented \u201cthe next conservative President\u2019s last opportunity to save our republic.\u201d \u201cConservatives have just two years and one shot to get this right,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWith enemies at home and abroad, there is no margin for error. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_west-virginia-idaho-anti-transgender-sports-bans", "text": "West Virginia and Idaho asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to decide whether states can lawfully enforce bans on transgender students competing on sports teams consistent with their gender identity. The two appeals from GOP-led states mark the first time the high court has been asked to decide the question in a substantive way\u00a0amid a yearslong legal battle waged by transgender students and their advocates against a slew of such bans enacted in more than two dozen states. The justices have already said they will decide a separate case concerning state efforts to ban gender-affirming\u00a0health\u00a0care for transgender\u00a0minors, but West Virginia and Idaho said that the court\u2019s eventual decision in that matter \u201cwill not resolve\u201d the issue at the center of their cases. Lower courts\u00a0have\u00a0ruled that the states\u2019 bans\u00a0are\u00a0unlawful, with a federal appeals court saying in April that West Virginia\u2019s ban violated a 13-year-old girl\u2019s rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid. That decision, West Virginia told the justices\u00a0in its petition, \u201crenders sex-separated sports an illusion.\u201d \u201cMuddled reasoning like the Fourth Circuit\u2019s will continue without this Court\u2019s intervention, and \u2018a nationally uniform approach\u2019 will never be possible,\u201d West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey wrote in court papers. The state\u00a0went\u00a0to the high court on an emergency basis in 2023 to get clearance to enforce the law while the legal challenge to it played out. But the justices, in an unsigned order,\u00a0declined.\u00a0Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the request. Signed into law\u00a0by West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice in 2021, the \u201cSave Women\u2019s Sports Act\u201d bans transgender women and girls from participating on public school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. Idaho, which in 2020 became the first state to enact a sports ban, has also been on the losing end of a fight over its law. Lower courts said that\u00a0that state\u2019s law\u00a0likely violated the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. \u201cSo much of what women and girls have achieved for themselves over the course of several decades is being stolen from them\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all under the guise of \u2018equality,\u2019\u201d Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador told the justices in court papers. \u201cThe Court should not wait any longer to correct these mistakes and to return the issue of protecting women\u2019s sports to the people\u2019s elected representatives,\u201d Labrador wrote. Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs who challenged the state bans, pledged to continue fighting the bans should the high court agree to hear the cases. \u201cAs the Fourth Circuit made abundantly clear, our client deserves the opportunity to participate in sports teams without discrimination,\u201d said Joshua Block, who is representing the student at the center of the West Virginia case. \u201cWe will make our position clear to the Court and continue to defend the right of all students to play as who they are.\u201d Chase Strangio, who has helped litigate the Idaho challenge to Idaho\u2019s law, said that state\u2019s ban \u201cis designed to alienate and stigmatize transgender people and we\u2019ll gladly make the case to the Court that they should leave the Ninth Circuit\u2019s thorough opinion in place.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/west-virginia-idaho-anti-transgender-sports-bans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_trump-burgum-rubio-running-mate", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, nearing an announcement of his running mate, said Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s an issue\u201d that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a near-total abortion ban in his state. The comments from the presumptive GOP nominee mark the latest insight he\u2019s shared about some of the top names thought to be under consideration for his vice presidential pick ahead of next week\u2019s Republican National Convention. He also weighed in Wednesday on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s residency, saying it \u201cmakes it more complicated\u201d since they both live in the Sunshine State. Asked about Burgum as a potential pick, Trump told Fox News Radio, \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of an issue. It\u2019s a pretty strong ban.\u201d Trump, who wants abortion to be left to the states to legislate, has said he thinks Republicans who support hardline bans on the procedure have suffered at the ballot box in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, though he regularly champions his role in building the conservative court majority that made that decision. \u201cYou know, I think Doug is great. But it is a strong, he\u2019s taken a very strong stance, or the state has, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Doug, but the state has, so it\u2019s an issue.\u201d Burgum signed the law, which only allows exceptions for rape or incest within the first six weeks of pregnancy, last year. Trump and Rubio both live in Florida, and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0the Constitution dictates that state electors must vote for a president and vice president \u201cone of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\u201d Trump said Rubio\u2019s residency wouldn\u2019t preclude the senator from being the pick, but said, \u201cIt makes it more complicated. There are people that don\u2019t have that complication. Now, it\u2019s fairly easily fixed, but you have to do something with delegates, or there has to be a resignation, you know, etc., etc.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s not like picking some people where it\u2019s very easy, where there is none of that,\u201d Trump continued. Rubio said Wednesday that getting around the residency issue to serve as vice president is \u201cnot without precedent\u201d and suggested he\u2019d be willing to serve in the role. \u201cAt this time in our history, given everything that we\u2019ve gone through, if someone has an opportunity to serve this country at that capacity, unless there\u2019s some reason why you can\u2019t do it, you almost have to say yes, especially if you care about public service as much as I do,\u201d Rubio told Fox Business. Rubio spoke at Trump\u2019s rally Tuesday at his golf course in Doral, Florida, where the former president continued to build suspense around his selection. \u201cI think they probably think I\u2019m going to be announcing that Marco\u2019s gonna be vice president,\u201d Trump said as he alluded to the media presence at his rally. Trump was also asked Wednesday whether Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance wouldn\u2019t be his pick because of his beard after a report from The Bulwark about Trump not liking facial hair. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never heard that one,\u201d Trump said, adding that he thought the Ohio Republican \u201clooks good\u201d and \u201clooks like a young Abraham Lincoln.\u201d Trump has said in recent interviews that he wants to announce his running mate at the GOP convention, which is taking place next week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but said it could also happen right before the convention. The presumptive GOP nominee, who has said he doesn\u2019t think President Joe Biden would exit the presidential race, said Wednesday during the radio interview that he hoped Biden would be the Democratic nominee because, \u201cWe planned for him.\u201d Trump suggested in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday that uncertainty around Biden\u2019s status as the Democratic nominee was a factor in his running mate selection. \u201cI haven\u2019t made final decisions, but I have some ideas as to where we\u2019re going. And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they\u2019re doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure that it would,\u201d Trump said. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_russian-bot-farm-propaganda-justice-department", "text": "The US Justice Department said Tuesday\u00a0that it\u00a0seized two internet domains and searched nearly 1,000 social media accounts that Russian operatives allegedly used to pose as US residents to spread disinformation in the US and abroad. The so-called bot farm used artificial intelligence to create fake social media profiles purporting to be people in the US and used those phony accounts to post support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, according to the Justice Department. The elaborate scheme was organized by an employee of RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, financed by the Kremlin, and aided an officer of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence, the Justice Department alleged. The news comes as US intelligence officials are on heightened alert for efforts by Russia or other foreign powers to meddle in the 2024 election. US\u00a0officials are watching closely to see whether\u00a0the\u00a0United States\u2019 support for Ukraine\u00a0will lead the Russian government\u00a0to take more risks\u00a0in potentially interfering in the 2024 presidential election,\u00a0FBI officials\u00a0previously\u00a0said. European countries have also been on high alert for a flood of Russian influence operations as the Kremlin tries to splinter support for Ukraine\u2019s defense. Russian propagandists have\u00a0ramped up\u00a0efforts to denigrate the Paris Olympics this month, including through a fake documentary that uses AI to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise, according to Microsoft. Asked for comment, an RT spokesperson did not respond to the substance of the Justice Department allegations, and instead emailed: \u201cFarming is a beloved pastime for millions of Russians.\u201d \u201cWe often hear accusations like these against Russia. And they are made with no arguments every time. We reject these accusations,\u201d the Kremlin press office said in an emailed statement from spokesman Dmitry Peskov: CNN has requested comment on the Justice Department announcement from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, and the FSB. X voluntarily suspended the bot accounts identified in court documents, the Justice Department said.\u00a0CNN has requested comment from X. It wasn\u2019t just the FBI that helped expose the alleged bot farm. US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit, was involved, as were Dutch and Canadian security agencies. The bot farm also targeted Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine and Israel, according to an\u00a0advisory\u00a0released Tuesday by US, Dutch and Canadian authorities. Long a mouthpiece for the Russian government, RT has seen some of its influence in the US wane in recent years as social media platforms have\u00a0taken steps to block access to its output. But the outlet has looked for new ways to reach audiences, including, the Justice Department alleges, through an army of fake X accounts. According to an affidavit from an FBI agent, RT leadership signed off on a proposal from an employee to use software to create a bot farm that \u201cin theory\u201d would \u201ccreate multiple social media accounts through which RT \u2026 could distribute information on a wide-scale basis.\u201d The scheme kicked into gear when Russian operatives bought one of two domain names in 2022 from an Arizona-based company, Namecheap, that were used to set up the bot farm, according to court documents. The RT employee, an FSB officer and others had access to the bot farm, which included X accounts that purported to be interested in cryptocurrency, according to the Justice Department. In one case, a fake account purporting to be based in Minneapolis posted a video of Russian President Vladimir Putin claiming that parts of Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania were a \u201cgift\u201d from Russian forces that freed them from Nazi control during World War II, the Justice Department said. In another case, a fake account replied to an unnamed US politician running for federal office with a video of Putin trying to justify Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the department said. The Justice Department \u201cwill not tolerate Russian government actors and their agents deploying AI to sow disinformation and fuel division among Americans,\u201d\u00a0Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/russian-bot-farm-propaganda-justice-department/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_biden-democrats-analysis", "text": "A staggering 24 hours that cracked the political foundation of Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid leave him facing the most high-pressure presidential news conference in modern history on Thursday. The stakes for Biden\u2019s solo appearance at the conclusion of the NATO summit multiplied by the hour as his political position unraveled at a dignity-sapping rate. Supporters from Congress to Hollywood warned that he needed to step aside for the sake of party and country, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a clear signal that a recalcitrant president should rethink his options. The rebellion, joined by just a small minority of congressional Democrats but appearing to run deeper, reflects the fear now surging through Capitol Hill that ex-President Donald Trump could conjure a GOP landslide that sweeps conservatives to a monopoly on power in Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court. Some Democrats fear that the 81-year-old Biden\u2019s determination to run again, despite the diminished skills exposed by the debate, could endanger the very democracy that he says he\u2019s trying to save. The president \u2014 who was in poor political shape even before the disastrous debate \u2014 is adamant that he won\u2019t pass the torch to a younger Democrat. But three factors could make his position untenable: a fracturing of support in his party; the drying up of fundraising; and damning polling data. As Biden greeted world leaders at the NATO summit on Wednesday and led discussions about how to save Ukraine, pieces were falling into place that could make this fateful trifecta a reality. Nothing less than Biden\u2019s hopes of a second term will be on the line at the news conference exactly two weeks after his incoherent and dazed debate performance sent his campaign into free fall. It\u2019s the latest in a series of public events that have turned into excruciating examinations of Biden\u2019s health and cognitive capacity, during which any slip up or confusion could trigger political disaster. Any sign his reasoning or performance are fogged by age would reinforce an impression of presidential infirmity seared into the national consciousness at the CNN debate and could inflame a stunning Democratic revolt. The ground is shifting under the president The day began with Pelosi, still a key party power broker, contradicting Biden\u2019s insistence that the matters of his abject debate performance and his nomination were closed. Appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d she said that it was up to Biden to \u201cdecide if he is going to run\u201d \u2014 comments that everyone in Washington interpreted as a request for Biden to change his mind. The California Democrat appeared to be offering the president another chance to gracefully change his mind after he warned earlier this week, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d All day, lawmakers sent similar signals. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres \u2014 a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has backed Biden \u2014 told CNN, \u201cIf we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d His fellow New Yorker, moderate Rep. Pat Ryan, called on Biden to live up to his vow to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. \u201cTrump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him. Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump.\u201d And Wednesday evening, Vermont Sen. Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on Biden to withdraw. \u201cHe saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again. But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not,\u201d Welch wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. Top Biden campaign officials are set to huddle with Democratic senators Thursday to make the president\u2019s case, but a staffers\u2019 briefing will fall well short of the steps that members are demanding to show that Biden has the strength to beat Trump. As recently as Tuesday evening, it seemed that Biden had succeeded in stalling momentum against him. But within 24 hours, he was fast losing ground and it\u2019s becoming hard to imagine how the party can unite behind him at the Democratic National Convention in August if many lawmakers will leave Chicago and head into an election in which they believe their presidential nominee will seal their defeat. The concerns from lawmakers are so significant because they are listening to voters, reading polling data in their states and concluding Biden not only can\u2019t win but \u2014 as Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said on CNN Tuesday \u2014 could hand Trump a landslide he could use to implement his authoritarian agenda. Top Democratic leaders in Congress have yet to say Biden should leave. And the president still has his defenders. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Biden ally and campaign co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday: \u201cHe\u2019s going to be our nominee at the convention. He is going to be our candidate in the fall. He is going to be the next president of the United States.\u201d Sen. John Fetterman, who represents the key swing state of Pennsylvania, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that it would be a \u201cdisgrace to discard and push out an amazing president\u201d and said he\u2019d show up to Thursday\u2019s Senate Democratic meeting with brass knuckles to defend Biden. But the rising frustration and indications that the president\u2019s cratering support could end the party\u2019s hopes in November help explain why Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told his members he\u2019d pass on their concerns to Biden. Biden isn\u2019t the \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 of 2010 The most personally stinging defection from Biden came from actor and Democratic mega donor George Clooney, who appeared at a fundraiser with the president only last month. The \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d director and star said he loved Biden, and believed in his morals, character and presidency. But he wrote in a New York Times op-ed, \u201cthe Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010.\u201d Clooney went on: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate. \u2026 We are not going to win in November with this president.\u201d Clooney\u2019s piece underscored how Biden\u2019s plight is not just a boiling political controversy but has become a heart-rending human ordeal for the president, who is loved by many Democrats but whose health and diminished capacities are now becoming fodder for humiliating debate in the most public fashion imaginable. Clooney maintains deep contacts with Democratic office holders and donors, so his views carry more weight than those of just any celebrity. And he\u2019s not the only disgruntled donor. In another danger sign for Biden\u2019s candidacy, one Democratic strategist told CNN, \u201cEverything is frozen because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen. Everyone is in wait and see mode,\u201d adding that money was on the sidelines and awaiting the outcome of Biden\u2019s Thursday news conference and interviews. The president will sit down with NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor\u00a0Lester\u00a0Holt\u00a0for an interview that will tape and air\u00a0next Monday, the network announced. There\u2019s been slippage for Biden since the debate in public polling. And Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who is locked in a tight Senate race in Michigan, told donors on a video call Tuesday that Biden was trailing Trump in private polling in her state, the New York Times reported. If the president cannot carry Michigan, as he did in 2020, his path to the 270 Electoral Votes needed to win the White House becomes negligible. The deepening crisis gripping the Democratic Party is not simply damaging Biden\u2019s chances of clinging to the nomination. It is also offering Trump and Republicans a bottomless source of attack ads against Biden if he\u2019s confirmed as the nominee. Individual candidates can also expect to be skewered over why they are supporting a party figurehead who many Democrats have declared is unfit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. And two weeks of agonizing over Biden\u2019s age and mental faculties, combined with a clumsy mitigation effort by the White House and the campaign, have taken the heat off Trump and deprived Democrats of the comparison with the ex-president\u2019s lawlessness and volatility that many had originally believed would help Biden hold the White House. Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign, warned that Democrats needed to end their feuding and get behind the president before it was too late. She told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that it was \u201castonishing\u201d that her party should be on a \u201csuicide mission\u201d so close to the election. But as Biden\u2019s political standing continues to rapidly deteriorate, the question is becoming how much longer he can insist he\u2019s the only Democrat who can beat Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/biden-democrats-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_tren-de-aragua-transnational-criminal-organization", "text": "The Biden administration will designate a dangerous Venezuelan gang infiltrating the United States as a significant transnational criminal organization on Thursday, according to a senior administration official, who described the gang as an \u201cemerging threat.\u201d Tren de Aragua, a transnational criminal gang that originated in a Venezuela prison and has slowly made its way south and north in recent years, is raising alarm among US officials. Tren de Aragua adopted its name between 2013 and 2015 but began operations years before, according to\u00a0a report by Transparency Venezuela.\u00a0For several years, the criminal group has terrorized South American countries, including Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile and Peru, and has gradually\u00a0made its way into the US. \u201cThe \u2018Tren de Aragua\u2019\u00a0is in the United States. We already have evidence that they crossed the border and we were able to confirm that through\u00a0interviews with\u00a0gang members after the crossing. They are crossing and there is a presence,\u201d FBI deputy special agent in charge of El Paso, Britton Boyd, told CNN earlier this year. In March,\u00a0a group of lawmakers called on the administration\u00a0to designate Tren de Aragua as a transnational criminal organization to deploy resources and sanctions to crack down on the group. The administration took that step Thursday. The transnational criminal organization designation, which takes effect immediately, will allow the Treasury Department to essentially cut off members from the US financial system. \u201cAs we\u2019re seeing the movement of TDA members north, in particular, we think it\u2019s critical that we take action to address this,\u201d the senior administration official said, adding that\u00a0law enforcement agencies also continue to investigate and prosecute\u00a0individuals associated with the gang. \u201cThis is an emerging threat that we have been focused on for some time\u2014and are trying to make sure that we stay on top of and get ahead of,\u201d the official added. The State Department, in coordination with the Justice Department, is also offering rewards totaling up to $12 million for information leading to the arrests and/or convictions of three leaders of the Tren de Aragua.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_george-clooney-joe-biden", "text": "The actor George Clooney, who had been among President Joe Biden\u2019s biggest supporters and donors in Hollywood, called on Biden to bow out of the presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after he headlined a major fundraiser for his reelection campaign. \u201cI love Joe Biden,\u201d Clooney wrote in a New York Times opinion piece. \u201cAs a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\u201d But, Clooney added, the Biden he saw during the June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \u201cwas not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020.\u201d \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney added, referencing Biden\u2019s faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN. That statement was a stunning assessment of Biden\u2019s current state from someone who has interacted with the president privately \u2014 that the way the president presented himself during that debate, which the White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed on a cold and a tiring travel schedule, was not an aberration. Clooney is not just a movie star and a prominent donor: He\u2019s someone who has spent time with Biden over the years and has always been a big fan. This goes all the way back to Biden\u2019s early days as vice president, when Clooney came by the White House and dropped in to Biden\u2019s then-office down the hall in the West Wing from the Oval Office and ended up having an extended visit talking about helping Darfur. Clooney is friendly with Obama too, but he and Biden have stayed in touch over the years, and the strength of that relationship held even when Biden criticized the International Criminal Court\u2019s May decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a result of his actions in Gaza \u2013 which Clooney\u2019s wife, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, had been a key part of crafting. Clooney called a top White House adviser to complain, but he did not pull back on his support then, or on his participation in the June fundraiser. Biden forcefully criticized the ICC\u2019s efforts because of the implication of an equivalence between Israel and Hamas. Clooney is also seen by many Democratic backers in Hollywood as a sort of compass given his engagement and activism. His standing with Biden until now helped rally wider donor and celebrity support, even among some who had never been big Biden fans and were not enthused about backing him long before the debate. Asked for comment Wednesday, Biden\u2019s campaign pointed toward the letter the president wrote to members of Congress on Monday indicating he would remain in the race. Clooney\u2019s opinion piece represents the biggest defection against Biden in Hollywood, which the party has long relied on for big-named support and money. It comes as a handful of Democrats in Congress have also publicly demanded Biden step aside due to persistent concerns about his age and mental acuity. The fundraiser that Clooney headlined raised $28 million for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, the most for the Democratic Party from a single event in history. A source familiar with the event says that part of the reason that the Los Angeles fundraiser took place on June 15\u00a0\u2013 immediately after Biden\u2019s travel to the G7 summit in Italy \u2013 was because that was the one date Clooney said would work for him. Biden has cited his intense travel ahead of last month\u2019s debate as one reason for his poor performance. In the opinion piece, Clooney called on key Democrats \u2014 naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 to ask Biden to \u201cvoluntarily step aside.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to win in November with this president,\u201d Clooney warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view. He said the country deserves to hear from other politicians who are seen as potential replacements for Biden on the ticket, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Saying \u201cthe dam has broken,\u201d Clooney wrote \u201cwe can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\u201d Many anxious Democrats who have been holding their breath and waiting to see what happens to Biden\u2019s reelection campaign have been stunned by the past 24 hours. One widely shared view had been that everything was likely to come to a head after this week\u2019s NATO conference that the US is hosting just blocks away from the White House. Instead,\u00a0devastating headlines have come out in rapid succession as Biden has been juggling various engagements on the global stage. \u201cThis seems to be moving more rapidly than I thought,\u201d one senior Democrat said. Clooney\u2019s opinion piece comes amid the most crucial week of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, as cracks in the coalition of Democratic support behind Biden continued to grow. At least ten members of Congress from his own party have publicly asked Biden to step down from the ticket. On Wednesday, CNN reported organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. Organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed\u00a0given the continued erosion of support\u00a0for Biden\u2019s candidacy. The event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, is just one of many events planned in conjunction with the party\u2019s convention, when the campaign was expecting to tap into high-dollar supporters\u2019 enthusiasm and wallets for the home stretch of the race. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule. Clooney isn\u2019t the only prominent Hollywood Democrat who has asked Biden to step down. Rob\u00a0Reiner, a Biden surrogate who attended a fundraiser alongside Harris after the debate, also called for the president to step aside. \u201cMy friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\u201d\u00a0Reiner said in a\u00a0post\u00a0to social media platform X Wednesday in which he linked to Clooney\u2019s op-ed. Reiner\u00a0began his calls on Biden to step down earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop (expletive) around. If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It\u2019s time for Joe Biden to step down,\u201d he\u00a0wrote\u00a0Sunday. Actor Michael Douglas said Wednesday that Clooney made a \u201cvalid point.\u201d Douglas and his wife, Catherine Zeta Jones, hosted a fundraiser for Biden in New York in April. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m, I\u2019m deeply, deeply concerned. I mean, especially is difficult because the Democrats have a big bench. I mean, a lot of heavy hitters,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d when asked about Clooney\u2019s opinion piece. Biden is participating in high-stakes meetings with NATO allies on Wednesday and will hold a solo news conference \u2014 his first since the debate \u2014 on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_nato-chinese-owned-infrastructure-europe", "text": "NATO officials are discussing taking action to reclaim some\u00a0Chinese-owned infrastructure projects\u00a0in Europe should a wider conflict with Russia break out in the east of the continent,\u00a0three officials involved in the discussions\u00a0told\u00a0CNN. A decade ago, when Europe was still crawling out of the economic crater caused by the global financial crisis, the promise of infrastructure funding from Chinese-owned investment firms seemed like a major windfall. Now, with the largest land war being waged in Europe since World War II \u2013 and the West warning of Beijing\u2019s support of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 NATO countries now see those investments as a liability, with allies beginning to discuss ways to reclaim some of those projects,\u00a0the officials said. The fear, according to one US official, is that Beijing could use the infrastructure it owns in Europe to provide material assistance to Russia if the conflict were to expand. The goal, officials said, is to figure out a path forward well in advance of any potential conflict. The discussions reflect an increasing focus on China by the NATO alliance. The\u00a0joint declaration released Wednesday by the 32 leaders,\u00a0at the Washington 75th\u00a0anniversary summit, strongly called out\u00a0Beijing\u2019s support for Moscow, in a move\u00a0seen as a sign of progress\u00a0by members eager to take a tougher stance against Beijing\u00a0after such a reference was omitted in 2023. \u201cThe deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order,\u201d the declaration states, \u201care a cause for profound concern.\u201d The discussions\u00a0on taking action on infrastructure, according to three officials involved in them, are still in their early stages and have seen varying levels of involvement among the NATO member countries. One NATO diplomat suggested the US, which is spearheading the discussions, would need to pursue the discussions on a bilateral basis to secure the necessary support. From rail lines connecting Eastern Europe to China, to ports located in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, China has funded tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure investments under its Belt & Road Initiative, which European nations began signing onto in 2013. A NATO official said that if a war erupted, the infrastructure \u201cwould almost certainly be nationalized, or nations would temporarily assume operating control, under emergency security measures. China can sue them in court after the fact.\u201d US officials see a precedent for such takeovers or sales in moves by European nations to force Russia to sell assets in the wake of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. For more than a year, Finland repeatedly blocked the business of Helsinki Shipyard \u2013 a producer of ice-breaking ships once owned by a Russian entity \u2013 until Russia in late 2023 sold the company to an entity based in Canada. A senior US official says the discussions have expanded beyond low-tech to include high-tech interests as well, like quantum computing, semiconductors, and telecom infrastructure. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the Ukraine\u00a0war\u00a0could be the reason that European and Asian nations have become clear-eyed about their security being tied to one another. \u201cMaybe this was crystallized by Ukraine, when Prime Minister Kishida of Japan said that what\u2019s happening in Europe today could be happening in East Asia tomorrow. When Russia committed its aggression, its renewed aggression against Ukraine, and Japan stood up, South Korea stood up, Australia, New Zealand, this was a reflection of that recognition that these challenges are linked,\u201d Blinken said at the NATO forum. But while most NATO member states have expressed some level of concern about Chinese-owned infrastructure, two officials involved in the discussions tell CNN that France in particular has sought to shift the discussions on infrastructure to the European Union, which has authority on other economic matters. Tension from France and other countries, officials say, impacted the language in the declaration\u00a0with the countries arguing that NATO is not the best platform from which to challenge China\u00a0\u2013 but many member states still harbor a very real fear that Beijing could utilize the hard assets against the alliance in the future,\u00a0and continue pushing for the alliance to defend against the threat. Speaking in Washington in mid-June ahead of the summit, outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that Beijing must face consequences for its support of Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_joe-biden-age-decline-democrats-angry", "text": "At a star-studded fundraiser for President Joe Biden in Los Angeles last month, George Clooney wasn\u2019t the only\u00a0one\u00a0who came away concerned about the president. Even before Biden\u00a0made\u00a0remarks that night, whispers of concern rippled through\u00a0the audience at the\u00a0Peacock Theater\u00a0about the president who had just arrived from a long flight from Italy. Some of the biggest donors at the $30 million fundraising event,\u00a0who had waited in line to take pictures with Biden,\u00a0expressed unease at how the president looked and carried himself. \u201cHe was less cogent than usual,\u201d said one attendee,\u00a0who was surprised that during a smaller meeting with donors before the main event, Biden barely spoke. Instead,\u00a0this person said, he left virtually all of the\u00a0talking to former President Barack Obama, which struck some guests as unusual for a loquacious politician like Biden. Biden\u2019s appearance\u00a0in California struck attendees as starkly different\u00a0from a fundraising gala he attended in March at Radio City Music Hall\u00a0in New York, one Democrat\u00a0guest\u00a0told CNN, when Biden appeared on stage with Obama and former President Bill Clinton. \u201cThere is a marked difference in the president from the spring to the summer,\u201d a senior\u00a0Democrat\u00a0told CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s just not the same.\u201d Back in Washington, there have been\u00a0clear signs\u00a0throughout his term\u00a0of Biden being\u00a0increasingly\u00a0stage-managed, with lists of talking points, names of questioners and drawings of where he should walk presented to him by aides. Ahead of closed-door Cabinet meetings\u00a0that Biden attends, it is customary for Cabinet officials to submit questions and key talking points that they plan to present in front of Biden ahead of time to White House aides, two sources with direct knowledge told CNN. \u201cThe entire display is kind of an act,\u201d one of those sources told CNN. \u201cThey would come and say, \u2018Hey, the president is going to call on you about 25 minutes in, and ask this question. What are the bullet points you\u2019ll respond with?\u2019\u201d The second source, who echoed that same description, said when Biden attends Cabinet meetings, they are \u201cnot free-wheeling, and pretty well-orchestrated.\u201d\u00a0And the meetings themselves are infrequent, with one Cabinet secretary telling CNN they are uncertain of Biden\u2019s condition because they so rarely see\u00a0him. In fact,\u00a0the\u00a0last full Cabinet meeting took place on October 2, 2023.\u00a0Sources also said Cabinet meetings during the Obama years, which Biden attended as vice president, were not pre-scripted this way. \u2018This is going to get worse\u2019 Even as the oldest sitting president in history,\u00a0at 81,\u00a0Biden\u2019s halting performance at CNN\u2019s presidential debate last month came as a serious shock to most inside the White House and across the administration, including senior officials who have known the president for years and regularly have private conversations and meetings with him. CNN talked to more than\u00a0two dozen\u00a0current and former Democratic officials, donors and longtime Biden allies, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating\u00a0Biden and discuss sensitive health matters verboten by the White House.\u00a0While it\u2019s clear the\u00a0president\u00a0had aged in the past year, none of them said they had seen the version of Biden, faltering and dazed, that showed up at last month\u2019s debate. In many of these conversations,\u00a0sources blamed the president\u2019s inner circle of advisers and family for what\u00a0they said\u00a0has become a\u00a0painstakingly choreographed daily operation designed to prevent him from being in unscripted settings for extended periods of time. \u201cThere\u2019s this general sense of just, unbelievable holding your breath every time he does an event, every time he\u2019s with people,\u201d one top Democrat in close touch with Biden\u2019s inner circle of advisers told CNN. This person added that some of those advisers have\u00a0privately\u00a0acknowledged: \u201cThis is going to get worse.\u201d That Democrat was blunt about how the president\u2019s closest advisers have responded to any criticism or concerns expressed about the president \u2013 including his age and fitness: \u201cEveryone who expresses any level of suspicion or contrary views? They call everyone and they beat the s*** out of them and say: \u2018Stay on message.\u2019\u201d At least one official involved in Biden\u2019s debate prep at Camp David raised doubts about his ability \u00a0after seeing how rehearsals were going, according to one source briefed on those preparations. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Biden\u2019s inner circle didn\u2019t know this,\u201d one Democratic strategist close to the White House\u00a0said of the extent of the president\u2019s recent decline. Campaign officials have rejected Clooney\u2019s and other donors\u2019 characterization of Biden at the Los Angeles fundraiser, with one senior Biden official who was in attendance telling CNN that while the president had in fact been tired that day, he was \u201canimated and extremely present.\u201d As for Biden\u2019s Cabinet meetings, the White House provided a statement from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack \u2013 who also served under Obama \u2013 saying what is described in this story is \u201cstandard practice for any administration\u201d because \u201cthere should not be surprise in Cabinet meetings.\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates defended the breadth of Biden\u2019s engagements with the press, his travels and record. \u201cJoe Biden has always said that it is fair for reporters to ask about his age and has always confidently shown his values, agenda, intelligence, and determination to the American people,\u201d Bates said. \u201cOfficials who meet with him frequently have spoken to his sharpness and command.\u201d Bates did not specifically offer comment on sources telling CNN that Biden\u2019s closest advisers are unaccepting of criticism or concerns about the president, including his age and health. \u2018Drip, drip, drip\u2019 After two weeks of defiance following the debate, Biden faces a growing number of calls to\u00a0bow out of the 2024 race. Many of the sources who spoke to CNN said they expected that the pressure will keep building, as more and more Democratic lawmakers signal he should go. \u201cExpect a drip, drip, drip,\u201d said one former Biden White House official. It\u2019s a crisis of potentially historic importance, with growing fears among Democrats that Biden could drag down the party\u2019s ticket, threaten the quest for reclaiming their House majority and further complicate efforts to hold onto Senate control. By Tuesday of this week, as frontline campaigns reviewed their own internal polling, it became clear that the concerns were widespread \u2013 and carried signs of sweeping down ballot damage, according to four Democratic campaign officials involved in key races. \u201cErosion. Across the board,\u201d one of the officials said. For Biden himself, the coming days are pivotal. His longtime ally, Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, said so herself when, during an appearance on MSNBC\u00a0this week, she reopened the door to Biden\u2019s decision, despite his insistence he is staying in the race. The president\u2019s news conference Thursday will be highly scrutinized, as donors and allies look for signs that Biden has the vigor to remain the Democratic candidate, as his campaign has argued. Biden will hold further off-the-cuff engagements next week as he sits for another closely-watched network interview Monday with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt. He will also hit the campaign trail, seeking to bolster his stance with Latino and Black coalitions during a trip to Las Vegas. No matter how Biden does, though, the damage of the debate is baked into the minds of a lot of Democrats who spoke to CNN. \u201cBlinders are off and everyone is aware,\u201d one source close to the White House told CNN. \u201cNumbers have changed; reality has changed; the people who make this all possible from a funding perspective are concerned; and your voters are telling you there\u2019s a lack of enthusiasm.\u201d \u2018What\u2019s your Plan B?\u2019 Even last\u00a0year, concern around Biden\u2019s age was noticeable\u00a0\u2013 and hardly a secret \u2013\u00a0among Democratic power circles. Last September, at the ultra-private confab in Aspen, Colorado, known among attendees as \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d Hollywood power broker and Democratic donor Ari Emanuel asked a pointed question of Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s former chief of staff and longtime adviser. \u201cWhat\u2019s your Plan B?\u201d Emanuel yelled to Klain who was on stage for a panel discussion about the\u00a0presidential\u00a0race, according to two attendees. Given Biden\u2019s age, Emanuel wanted to know what the Democrats\u2019 back-up plan was heading into the primaries and how quickly it could be executed. Klain, the attendees said, appeared exasperated in his response. \u201cHe\u2019s the sitting president of the United States! What do you want me to do?\u201d As attendees rode a bus to another venue to hear Obama deliver a lunchtime speech, the chatter turned to Emanuel\u2019s outburst, and the shared view that Biden, then 80, was getting over his skis: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone protect this man?\u201d one wondered aloud. The exchange \u2013 which neither Emanuel nor Klain would confirm or deny \u2013 underscores the long-held reservations among influential Democrats about the viability of Biden months before the debate. That same month, when Biden spoke at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus at their annual gala last September, attendees took notice of his slurring of words and at times, appearing\u00a0confused. Some\u00a0started to wonder: Is this more than just his stutter? The thought among attendees who spoke to CNN was brushed aside \u2013 until the presidential debate. \u201cHe\u2019s declined,\u201d one House Democratic lawmaker who attended the gala told CNN. As a part of the White House\u2019s response for this story, Bates also said \u201cofficials who meet with [Biden] frequently have spoken to his sharpness and command,\u201d and shared the following quote from White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk: \u201cIf what is being written now about President Biden were true, history would be very different.\u201d \u2018We all noticed it\u2019 Advisers to the president have grown extraordinarily sensitive to how Biden will physically appear on camera. His team has sought to remedy for the president\u2019s stiffened gait, which in more recent years has produced images of the president shuffling and taking shorter steps \u2013 universally understood signs of aging. In the lead-up to last November\u2019s summit between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u00a0in California, some senior officials\u00a0vehemently argued that only photos \u2013 and not video \u2013 of the two men walking side-by-side should emerge from the historic\u00a0meeting. They\u00a0did not want the image of the president\u00a0shuffling next to his younger Chinese counterpart to play on loop on TV news and circulate on social media. Ultimately, after the conclusion of hours of meetings, the two men took a brief walk around the gardens of the Filoli estate. What the cameras caught of that walk lasted all but a minute \u2013 Biden flashed two thumbs-up to reporters before rounding the corner. Bursts of activity are often followed by planned downtime which is fiercely protected on the president\u2019s schedule. The practice of planned downtime extends to overseas trips as well. French\u00a0officials\u00a0involved in the planning of the June state visit said that the Biden team had requested two days of rest during the five-day trip. Those so-called \u201cdown days\u201d allowed First Lady Jill Biden to travel back to Wilmington, Delaware, to hold forth in the courtroom during Hunter Biden\u2019s trial on gun charges, but they also afforded the president large swaths of time to rest and prepare for the varied engagements on D-Day and in Paris with President Emmanuel Macron. Biden returned to the US between the visit to France and the gathering of G-7 allies the following week, and during the interim days delivered remarks on gun safety and visited Wilmington to huddle with family following the conclusion of his son\u2019s gun trial. When he arrived in Italy days later,\u00a0one European diplomat mentioned that his exhaustion was apparent, as it had become in many recent encounters. \u201cAt\u00a0the G7, it was obvious that he was old. At one point, he wanted to sit and there was no\u00a0chair,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cHe was moving slowly. Stupid things, but they showed that he\u2019s an old person who need assistance.\u00a0We all noticed it.\u201d Eyes on Jill Many of the Democratic sources who spoke to CNN expressed\u00a0concerns and disappointment\u00a0with Jill Biden for enabling the\u00a0president\u2019s\u00a0defiant stance.\u00a0But defenders of the first lady argue she will always be supportive of her spouse of 47 years and pushed back on recent criticisms of her since the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair (and frankly ludicrous) to put the future of the Democratic Party on Jill Biden,\u201d one ally of the president and first lady said. \u201cShe\u2019s not elected, not a professional political advisor; she\u2019s not a pollster, or a campaign manager. This is not to diminish her \u2013 she is a very consequential First Lady, and she has done incredible things as FLOTUS.\u201d The first lady remains the\u00a0president\u2019s\u00a0closest adviser and fiercest protector \u2013 a role she\u2019s long held but has taken on heightened significance as\u00a0Biden has\u00a0grappled with the debate fallout. She wields influence in the White House and campaign, and sits in on some of the\u00a0president\u2019s\u00a0political meetings. As the president plots a path forward, sources have emphasized that no significant decisions will be made without her input. Jill Biden\u2019s campaign schedule has ramped up aggressively in recent weeks \u2013 coinciding with the end of the spring semester at the community college where she teaches English. A reluctant politician, Jill Biden has emerged as one of her husband\u2019s top surrogates and fundraisers. One Biden adviser, however, said that the first lady and the president\u2019s sister, Valerie Biden Owens, are the only figures in the president\u2019s orbit who could\u00a0ultimately\u00a0persuade him to exit the race, and only if they had hard data.\u00a0\u201cJill and Valerie won\u2019t let him go down in flames,\u201d a Biden adviser said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_gretchen-whitmer-biden-cognitive-test-cnntv", "text": "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday \u201cit wouldn\u2019t hurt\u201d for President Joe Biden to take a cognitive test, a move that could quell mounting concerns over his mental fitness following a poor debate performance in June. \u201cI don\u2019t think that it would hurt,\u201d the Democrat said after being pressed by CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on whether Biden should take a test and demand that former President Donald Trump do the same. While Whitmer acknowledged on \u201cNewsNight\u201d that the debate was \u201cnot a great success\u201d for Biden, she pushed back on calls for the president to step aside from his 2024 campaign. \u201cHe shows up every day and fights for the American public. He cares about other people more than he cares about himself, and that\u2019s precisely why I think this moment where we have Donald Trump, who\u2019s been convicted of 34 felonies, who cares only about Donald Trump,\u00a0we can\u2019t lose sight of how high these stakes are,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe have a field, and unless one person, Joe Biden, makes an alternative decision, this is the field, and we\u2019ve got to go.\u201d In a high stakes interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos last Friday, Biden said that his poor debate performance was not evidence of a serious condition. Being president, he said, means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d When asked on Friday whether he\u2019s had cognitive tests and an exam by a neurologist, Biden said no. \u201cNo one said I had to. \u2026 They said I\u2019m good,\u201d the president said. Biden gave no indication he would be willing to have such tests conducted in the aftermath of his debate performance. Whitmer\u2019s comments come as Democrats wrestle with the potential for Biden\u2019s reelection bid to hurt the party in down-ballot races this fall. Nine House Democrats have called for the president to step aside, and Vermont\u2019s Peter Welch on Wednesday evening became the first Senate Democrat to urge him to withdraw. Whitmer, who has been floated as a possible candidate to enter the race should Biden step aside, was present at a meeting Biden held last week with Democratic governors but did not address members of the press immediately after. On Wednesday, she backed the president and said she was concerned that \u201cwe are spending a lot of energy not on Donald Trump and the existential threat before us, and that gives me a great deal of concern.\u201d \u201cI understand that some are playing fantasy football and want to just pick a couple of random leaders that they like across the country and design a ticket. That\u2019s just not how this works,\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cWe have a president who\u2019s gotten a nomination, who\u2019s earned it.\u201d When asked if she was worried that she would be targeted for retribution should Trump win, Whitmer said that she has been told that he keeps a list with both Republicans and \u201cprobably a lot of Democrats on it too.\u201d \u201cI think that that should tell you everything you need to know about this man,\u201d she said. Whitmer pointed towards the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling that granted presidents in general a definitive \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution for core official acts. \u201cI think everyone who is critical or has a mind of their own should be concerned about someone who is willing to abuse power and misuse it, especially with this new Supreme Court ruling on immunity, this could be a very scary time if Donald Trump is back in the White House,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_biden-democratic-lawmakers-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday clung onto the Democratic nomination on a high-stakes day in Washington, but the risks of his refusal to step aside were laid bare when one of his party\u2019s senators warned on CNN that Donald Trump could win in a \u201clandslide.\u201d Biden\u2019s stubbornness leaves Democrats increasingly fearful that the president could put at risk not just the White House but any chance of retaking the House or holding the Senate \u2014 already an uphill battle. The White House did succeed in heading off rebellions in emotional meetings of Senate and House Democrats on Tuesday but even some members who back Biden expressed reservations about his tactics and capacity to run a winning campaign. And on Wednesday, uncertainty about the president\u2019s prospects grew with comments from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and as actor and Democratic donor George Clooney called on Biden to voluntarily step aside. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet was among three Democrats who privately voiced fears that Biden couldn\u2019t win in November, sources told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, and then became the first of his colleagues to go public. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I said that,\u201d Bennet told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\u201d He added: \u201cSo for me, this isn\u2019t a question about polling. It\u2019s not a question about politics. It\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country.\u201d \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\u201d Bennet\u2019s remarks do not represent the public position of all Democratic senators but there is no doubt the debate and its aftermath have created deep concern in the party. Pelosi referred to that anxiety among members when she appeared to suggest that, despite Biden\u2019s insistence he\u2019s going nowhere, the issue of his spot on the Democratic ticket was still uncertain.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\u201d she said on MSNBC Wednesday morning. \u201cI want him to do whatever he decides to do and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d And in a remarkable op-ed in The New York Times, Clooney turned on the president after appearing alongside him at a fundraiser last month. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d\u00a0Clooney\u00a0wrote.\u00a0\u201cWe are not going to win in November with this president,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view. The last two weeks have badly weakened Biden\u2019s standing in a party already unenthusiastic about his campaign. His terrible stretch threatens to further narrow an already tenuous path to reelection against an invigorated\u00a0Trump, who burst back onto the campaign trail Tuesday night with a blistering rally in Florida, nine days before he accepts the Republican nomination. Deep disquiet over the president\u2019s prospects hung over shaken Democratic senators and representatives in Washington Tuesday, as venting sessions took place behind closed doors at both ends of the US Capitol. But no critical mass of lawmakers emerged to seriously threaten Biden\u2019s hold on the nomination and the party\u2019s Senate and House leaders offered clear, if hardly effusive, support for the president. Ultimately, Biden\u2019s warning in a letter to lawmakers on Monday \u2014 \u201cI am firmly committed to staying in this race\u201d \u2014 and the knowledge that primary voters have spoken left his critics little leeway to act. Pelosi on Wednesday morning again implied that the question of the Democratic ticket was not closed. She advised Democrats, \u201cjust hold off, whatever you\u2019re thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don\u2019t have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\u201d After Pelosi\u2019s comments went viral, a spokesperson said in a statement that the former speaker \u201cfully supports whatever President Biden decides to do.\u201d Another Democrat, Rep. Ritchie Torres,\u00a0offered a stark warning\u00a0to CNN\u00a0about the potential\u00a0down-ballot\u00a0effect\u00a0of Biden\u2019s reelection bid Wednesday: \u201cIf we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d \u201cThere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d Torres also said in a statement. Biden will face a fresh test on Thursday when he holds a solo press conference at the end of the NATO summit. Any slip-ups or confusion would rip off the fragile patch Biden has fixed on the dam of Democratic Party support. The spectacle of a party debating the viability, strength and mental capacity of its nominee less than four months from Election Day encapsulates the crisis that has consumed the president\u2019s campaign. There is little evidence so far that Biden is ready to throw himself into saturation-level town halls, campaign swings and media blitzes that many Democrats \u2014 including those who think he should stay in the race \u2014 have called on him to do. Some Democrats now see him as unlikely to win in November. And for all of them, the vibe is existential because Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, has rarely been in a stronger political position since jumping into presidential politics. Biden survives a critical day Tuesday had been seen as a critical day for Biden because it was the first time lawmakers gathered en masse since the debate late last month and the July Fourth recess that followed. But even as the number of lawmakers calling for him to step aside ticked up, the president so far this week has managed to stabilize the post-debate crisis. \u201cWe do want to turn the page. We want to get to the other side of this,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters, although Biden\u2019s parlous political fortunes as the oldest-ever president mean this may be an impossible aspiration. Still, Biden delivered one of his strongest recent public appearances in welcoming world leaders to the NATO summit in Washington Tuesday, even if the effect of aging was obvious in his diction and movements. \u201cRemember, the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen,\u201d he said, while lauding the \u201csingle greatest, most effective defense alliance in the history of the world.\u201d The boldness of Biden\u2019s rhetoric was a reminder that the summit should have been all about showcasing his leadership as one of the most significant leaders of the West since World War II and setting up a contrast with Trump, who spent his first term berating America\u2019s European allies. Instead, the event has turned into a test of the president\u2019s acuity. White House officials told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche that Tuesday\u2019s speech went off as planned and that staff hoped that Biden could now go back to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d That\u2019s unlikely to happen because every public event by the president has turned into an excruciating vigil with everyone braced for gaffes, awkward moments or freezes. And his every on-camera appearance is refracted through the prism of a debate performance that seared an unflattering picture of a struggling Biden on the minds of 50 million viewers. It\u2019s a low bar for a president to get through a short, scripted speech on a teleprompter at a summit without having a catastrophe. And Biden\u2019s often glacial pace in big public moments creates poignant contrasts with the wise-cracking force of nature that he used to be. The equation is unlikely to change over the next four months because it\u2019s endemic to this matchup and the president\u2019s decision to run for a new term that would end when he is 86. Biden needs one of his classic comebacks more than ever Still, it\u2019s too early to count Biden out. Voters decide elections, not critical lawmakers or scathing media commentary. The president has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise and has found inner steel in a life scarred by personal tragedy and political disappointments. And Trump, the first former president to be a convicted criminal, has an uncanny capacity to alienate moderate, suburban, and swing voters with his extreme rhetoric and threats against his opponents. The ex-president will be back center stage next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is likely to turn into a MAGA festival that the Biden camp sees as a chance to reinforce the contrast with Trump that the president\u2019s debate nightmare obliterated for the last two weeks. Most post-debate national polls suggest Biden lost at least a couple of points to Trump in what had been a race inside the margin of error. There is little high-quality polling in swing states so far that spans the debate aftermath. But Biden was generally seen as trailing Trump in many of the battlegrounds that will decide the election before the debate, which he needed to use to reset his clash with Trump. Instead, he created reverse momentum that he\u2019s still not arrested. And it\u2019s not just a question of the horse race. Biden was unable to use his debate answers to frame a sharp contrast with Trump on the most important issues to Democrats, including abortion, taxes, character, and the ex-president\u2019s perceived threat to democracy and founding US values. This \u2013 along with Biden\u2019s somewhat delusional disbelief in his own mid-30s approval rating and the apparent state of the race \u2013 fueled Democratic despair. That sense of disappointment with Biden was on display as lawmakers filed into their meetings on Tuesday, with many declining to speak to reporters on the way out. A source familiar with the Democratic Senate lunch told CNN\u2019s Bash that as well as Bennet, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana told colleagues they don\u2019t think Biden can beat Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I said that,\u201d Bennet told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins later Tuesday. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\u201d Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said senators believe Biden must take on unscripted situations to answer questions from voters. King, asked what would happen if Biden stumbled in such settings, replied: \u201cIt seems to me that\u2019s a risk they have to take. If he\u2019s OK, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d One of Biden\u2019s most fervent supporters, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, defended the president. \u201cWe concluded that Joe Biden is old; we found out, and the polling came back that he\u2019s old,\u201d Fetterman told CNN. \u201cBut we also agreed that he\u2019s our guy.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is rarely reluctant to speak at length, was asked several times about Biden but only replied, \u201cI\u2019m with Joe,\u201d in an apparent attempt to shut down the line of questioning. Biden got a boost when New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who had privately expressed doubts about the president\u2019s spot on the ticket, said he\u2019d now support him. But the New York Democrat hinted that his decision had as much to do with the difficultly of pushing the presumptive party nominee aside as a feeling that he was a strong bet. \u201cI\u2019m not resigned to it. He made very clear he\u2019s going to run. He\u2019s got an excellent record, one of the most excellent presidents of the last century. Trump would be an absolute disaster for democracy; so, I\u2019m enthusiastically supporting Biden,\u201d Nadler said. The president has also been bolstered by the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, a vital power player in the House Democratic Caucus. Many of the CBC\u2019s members are in solid blue districts and may be under less pressure than frontline Democrats who have criticized the president\u2019s debate performance. Texas Rep. Marc Veasey expressed concern for those vulnerable colleagues when criticizing Biden\u2019s attempt to bounce back from the debate. \u201cWhatever I have seen so far hasn\u2019t shown me that that\u2019s going to be enough to get there. I just don\u2019t think that dog is gonna hunt,\u201d Veasey told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cI think that he has a long way to go and I think there are stronger candidates that would be more likely to beat Trump at this point, but if he says that he is going to stay in, (then) he\u2019s the nominee,\u201d Veasey said. Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey lavished praise on Biden\u2019s presidency and his victory over Trump in 2020 but became the seventh House Democrat to call on him to stand aside on Tuesday. \u201cBecause I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won\u2019t run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\u201d Some Democratic leaders sought to jump their members out of their angst by launching an attack against Trump. \u201cEvery single member of the House Democratic Caucus is clear eyed about what the stakes of this election are,\u201d said Rep. Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the caucus. \u201cDonald Trump cannot be allowed near the Oval Office and his extremist allies must never be allowed to pass a national abortion ban or their dangerous Project 2025, which would erode our democracy and enable Trump\u2019s worst impulses,\u201d the California Democrat said. But the strength of his presentation in a press conference only served to highlight the lines of attack that Biden largely missed in the debate. There was a brighter mood around the Democratic ticket in Las Vegas, where Vice President Kamala Harris displayed the forensic rhetoric of a former prosecutor to attack Trump. \u201cI will say that someone who vilifies immigrants, who promotes xenophobia, someone who stokes hate should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone and the seal of the President of the United States,\u201d Harris said. For those Democrats who think Harris would make a better nominee than the president, her fiery delivery was a reminder of an alternative 2024 path that Biden has acted to close off.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is rejecting any idea that he would step aside as the Democratic nominee, a decision that is his alone. When we asked readers what questions they have about Biden, they expressed some confusion about the process that made him the presumptive Democratic nominee. Here are answers to some of the questions posed to CNN from readers: No. There was a series of primaries in states and territories this year and voters in those contests overwhelmingly backed Biden. He faced only token opposition from a little-known congressman, Rep. Dean Phillips, and an author, Marianne Williamson. Biden won nearly all of the 3,949 pledged delegates who will officially select the party\u2019s nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Delegates pick the nominee during a roll-call vote. While party rules don\u2019t formally require delegates to vote for the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged, they\u2019re supposed to, and campaigns have the right to approve the delegates pledged to their candidates. Biden has the votes to win the nomination in that first round of voting and realistically, it\u2019s highly unlikely that another candidate could be elected without Biden voluntarily stepping aside. This is an unprecedented situation. Primaries began in January and went on for months. That monthslong process provided Democrats and independents who wanted to take part in the Democratic primary the opportunity to back a different candidate. Each one of those primaries, arguably, was a sort of off-ramp. But Democrats at the time were largely rallying behind Biden. That was, however, before his poor debate performance fed festering concerns about his age. It is remarkable that even though polling has long suggested voters feel Biden is too old and would have preferred a different choice, high quality opponents did not challenge him. Phillips and Williamson never gained traction and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. left the Democratic Party to run as an independent rather than challenge Biden for the party nomination. The party also worked hard to discourage opposition to Biden. It did not sponsor debates, and multiple states, including Delaware and Florida, did not hold Democratic primaries after it was clear that Biden had the delegates to win the nomination. Delegates are supposed to honor the voters in their states. Here\u2019s the language in the Democratic party rules for the 2024 convention: \u201cAll delegates to the National Convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d Primaries are an important part of the process and primary voters chose Biden. Not that they had much choice; the party worked hard to unify early behind Biden and discouraged serious opposition. But delegates technically pick the party nominee, which is why it would probably take Biden releasing the delegates he won to replace him on the ticket. We received several versions of this question, not all of them fit to print. The large universe of people who believe Trump is unfit to be president have thought that for a long time. There is a universe of people who are newly questioning Biden\u2019s fitness after the debate. I would point out that figure \u2013 that Trump lied more than 30 times at the debate \u2013 is directly reported in CNN\u2019s Fact Check of the debate. From that report: Trump\u2019s repeat falsehoods included his assertions that some Democratic-led states\u00a0allow babies to be executed after birth, that\u00a0every legal scholar and everybody in general wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, that there were\u00a0no terror attacks during his presidency, that\u00a0Iran didn\u2019t fund terror groups during his presidency,\u00a0that\u00a0the US has provided more aid to Ukraine than Europe has, that\u00a0Biden for years referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators,\u201d that Biden is\u00a0planning to quadruple people\u2019s taxes, that\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 National Guard troops for the US Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u00a0that Americans don\u2019t pay the cost of his tariffs on China and other countries, that\u00a0Europe accepts no American cars, that\u00a0he is the president who got the Veterans Choice program through Congress, and\u00a0that fraud marred the results of the 2020 election. So I believe it is inaccurate to say the media is giving Trump a pass. Trump, for his part, has all but disappeared from the campaign trail since the debate and Biden is holding events, doing TV and audio interviews and more as he engages in damage control. There has also been ample coverage of Trump\u2019s criminal trial, his many other legal troubles, and his often outrageous claims and policy proposals. Biden argues he has the best chance of winning and says the pollsters he talks to say the race is a tossup. High-quality public polling since the debate, on the other hand, suggests Trump does have a lead. In hypothetical matchups in which other Democrats are put up against Trump, the results are not currently much different. If those numbers start to change dramatically, pressure on Biden to drop out will increase dramatically. When I put this question to CNN\u2019s polling director, Jennifer Agiesta, she cautioned that polling is frequently misinterpreted as a tool to predict the future. It does not tell us who has a better chance of winning, but the state of the race in a particular moment. \u201cEven before the debate there was almost no polling showing Biden with a significant lead of Trump nationally or in key states,\u201d Agiesta said. \u201cIn a two-way matchup between Trump and Biden, there hasn\u2019t been a high-quality poll showing a significant Biden lead since February.\u201d Biden says he does not have a debilitating cognitive condition so it does not appear he is hiding one. His advisers argue that he maintains a full campaign and governing schedule and he frequently appears in public, although his advisers have clearly tried to minimize unscripted moments. Impeachment is utilized to punish \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d according to the US Constitution. Republican efforts to impeach Biden, which have so far failed, have focused not on his age, but on his son\u2019s former business interests. The 25th Amendment provides a pathway to dislodge an incapacitated president, but it is a complicated process and would require a majority of Biden\u2019s Cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris to agree in writing that he is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d None of his allies are currently saying that about him. But if, in the future, a majority of his Cabinet and Harris (or some other body appointed by Congress) turned on Biden and tried to declare him incapacitated, he could dispute their finding and resume his duties. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days in which to double down on their declaration that the president was unfit, at which point both houses of Congress would have 21 days to decide in a vote if he should carry on as president. It would require two-thirds of the Senate (usually 67 of 100 senators) and two-thirds of the House (usually 290 of 435 representatives) to remove the president from office. Democrats have not exactly turned on Biden. Only a handful of elected Democrats have publicly argued he should step down as the party\u2019s candidate in 2024. But they are almost universally worried that Trump will beat Biden in a rematch. Not only do Democrats disagree with the former president\u2019s policies, they also view him as a destabilizing threat to American democracy. If Biden is not viewed as capable by the few independent voters who might support either candidate, it makes a Trump election more likely. This would get very complicated, as CNN\u2019s David Wright has written: It\u2019s a significant war chest that\u00a0totaled $240 million at the end of June, including the Democratic National Convention and allied committees, according to an announcement from Biden\u2019s campaign on Tuesday. At the end of May, Biden\u2019s campaign account alone held $91.6 million, according to the most recent available data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). If Harris\u00a0were\u00a0tapped as a replacement nominee, she would take over the existing campaign account, and have control of funds deposited there, per FEC rules. If the race were thrown open,\u00a0the Biden-Harris campaign could\u00a0transfer all of\u00a0its\u00a0cash on hand\u00a0to the Democratic National Committee, as\u00a0FEC rules\u00a0permit unlimited transfers from candidate committees to national party committees. The DNC could use those funds in several ways to support a new nominee, and could distribute that money to a variety of other down ballot candidates and allied committees \u2013 but in doing so, the DNC would be limited by FEC rules governing spending and contributions\u00a0for national party committees. There are other options, each with its own set of drawbacks, according to Wright, including turning Biden\u2019s campaign account into a PAC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_michael-cohen-supreme-court-trump-alleged-retaliation", "text": "Michael Cohen, the one-time fixer for Donald Trump, is asking the Supreme Court to revive his lawsuit against the former president for allegedly retaliating against him for promoting his tell-all book critical of Trump, according to Cohen\u2019s attorney. Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr and other federal officials in 2021 for alleged retaliation in response to public comments he made about the book. After declining to sign an agreement barring him from speaking with the media, Cohen was taken back into custody and placed in solitary confinement for more than two weeks, court records show. A US District Court dismissed Cohen\u2019s lawsuit for damages, and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0upheld that decision in January. \u201cWhen Cohen, who was writing a book critical of Trump, did not agree immediately to waive his right to free speech, he was summarily sent back to prison and thrown into solitary confinement,\u201d Cohen told the Supreme Court in an appeal his lawyer said he filed Wednesday. \u201cAs it stands, this case represents the principle that presidents and their subordinates can lock away critics of the executive without consequence.\u201d For the claim to survive, Cohen will have to clear a tall hurdle the Supreme Court has erected that makes it difficult for Americans to sue federal law enforcement officials. A\u00a01971 Supreme Court decision,\u00a0Bivens\u00a0v. Six Unknown Named Agents, established that people could sue federal agents if their rights were violated. But the court has been unwilling to expand that right beyond a limited number of circumstances. Two years ago, the high court denied a \u201cBivens\u201d claim against a Border Patrol agent in Washington state and further limited the conditions under which such lawsuits can be filed. That litigation followed an\u00a0encounter in which the owner of an inn near the US-Canada border claimed the agent used excessive force and then retaliated against him for reporting the incident. Cohen, speaking with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Wednesday, described himself as, in essence, a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d who was held because he \u201crefused to waive a\u00a0constitutional right.\u201d \u201cI\u00a0believe that it\u2019s incumbent\u00a0upon the Supreme Court of the\u00a0United States to hear this case,\u201d Cohen said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d He said people \u201chave to be very,\u00a0very careful, and what they have to\u00a0be very cognizant of is what\u00a0happens now post the Supreme\u00a0Court\u2019s decision on\u00a0presidential immunity.\u201d Opponents of the conservative court\u2019s\u00a0presidential immunity ruling\u00a0earlier this month claim some illegal acts committed by a president \u2014 like targeting political opponents \u2014 may now be shielded from criminal prosecution. The Supreme Court will likely decide in the fall whether or not to hear arguments in Cohen\u2019s appeal. A Trump campaign spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine counts, including for campaign finance violations tied to payments he made or orchestrated to women during the 2016 campaign, and\u00a0was serving a three-year prison sentence.\u00a0He was released from prison on furlough in 2020 during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. When Cohen met with probation officials later that year,\u00a0they presented Cohen with\u00a0an agreement that required him to avoid engaging with the media and using social media. After Cohen sought to change the terms of that agreement, he was transported back to prison and placed in solitary confinement for 16 days, according to court records. At the appeals court, Trump\u2019s attorneys described Cohen\u2019s claims as \u201cmeritless\u201d and said he failed to establish any connection between the former president and the agreement. A federal court ordered Cohen\u2019s release days later. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_republicans-noncitizen-voting-elections-trump", "text": "Voters in eight states soon will decide whether to change their constitutions to explicitly ban voting by noncitizens, part of a multipronged effort by allies of Donald Trump to raise the unlikely specter of foreigners casting ballots in November\u2019s elections to throw the race to his Democratic opponent. North Carolina, a potential presidential battleground, is the most recent state to put a citizen-only voting measure on the fall ballot \u2013 joining Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin, another key swing state in the race for the White House. It\u2019s illegal for people who aren\u2019t US citizens to vote in federal contests, and experts say it rarely happens, given that violators face imprisonment and deportation. But Republican policymakers have pointed to moves by individual cities to give legal noncitizen immigrants the authority to vote on municipal matters to stoke concerns about foreign infiltration of US elections. The growing citizen-only voting movement marries two issues Republicans hope will animate their base this fall: concerns about election fraud and illegal immigration. The Republican-controlled US House voted Wednesday to require proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections.\u00a0In recent weeks, top Republican officials who oversee elections in Tennessee and Ohio have flagged potential noncitizens on their voting rolls, and Louisiana has enacted a law requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. On Monday, Republicans approved a draft party platform that includes a call for proof of citizenship in voting. The platform will be taken up next week at the GOP\u2019s national convention in Milwaukee. Trump himself has made outlandish claims about Democrats seeking to add undocumented immigrants to the voter rolls. \u201cNon citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians who are not being stopped by an equally dishonest Justice Department,\u201d the former president wrote Tuesday on his Truth Social platform, urging passage of the congressional bill, known as the SAVE Act. Critics, however, say the push to require proof of citizenship to vote could erect unnecessary barriers for US citizens, including young people on college campuses who might not have ready access to their birth certificates when they register to vote. And they argue that Republicans aligned with Trump are hoping to establish a predicate to challenge the outcome of November\u2019s election should the GOP not succeed in winning the White House and making gains in Congress. Michael Waldman, the president of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school, called concerns about widespread noncitizen voting \u201can urban myth \u2026 being pushed preemptively, I believe, to set the stage for undermining the legitimacy of the 2024 election.\u201d \u201cThis year, the Big Lie is being pre-deployed,\u201d he said during a recent congressional hearing. Trump allies are among those lobbying for the changes.\u00a0Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser in the Trump White House known for his hard-line immigration positions, recently spoke in support of changing federal law to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Lawmakers who oppose that, Miller said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, \u201cwill be declaring to the whole country that they want Joe Biden\u2019s illegals to vote in this election.\u201d Cleta Mitchell, a conservative lawyer who joined Trump on his now-infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to \u201cfind\u201d the necessary votes to overturn his 2020 defeat in the state, recently launched the Only Citizens Vote Coalition, which advocates proof-of-citizenship laws. Federal and state moves Republicans on Capitol Hill have made the issue a priority. The GOP-controlled House has voted to repeal a Washington, DC, statute permitting legal permanent residents of the city to vote in local elections. The measure the House approved Wednesday, which had Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s backing, would require people to present proof of citizenship \u2013 such as a birth certificate or valid US passport \u2013 in person when registering to vote. Neither bill is expected to pass the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority. But Johnson, at a recent news conference, said potential voting by undocumented immigrants represents a \u201cclear and present danger to the integrity of our election system\u201d and called the proof-of-citizenship bill \u201cone of the most important pieces of legislation that will be presented within our lifetime.\u201d Among its provisions: requiring states to establish a system for removing noncitizens from their voting rolls and giving state officials access to federal agency databases to help determine the citizenship status of voters. The bill would also allow private citizens to file lawsuits against election officials who registered noncitizens to vote. The push to spell out prohibitions on noncitizen voting has gained traction at the state level too.\u00a0Voters in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota and Ohio all have approved citizenship voting requirements in recent years. And since the 2020 election, 11 states have approved new laws targeting noncitizen voting, according to a tally by the Voting Rights Lab. In North Carolina, the Republican-controlled legislature late last month approved the fall ballot measure that would enshrine citizen-only voting in the state constitution. Like other states, the North Carolina legislature has the power to refer measures to the ballot without requiring the governor\u2019s signature. Voting by noncitizens is already against state law in North Carolina. And the state\u2019s constitution says that \u201cevery person born in the United States and every person who has been naturalized\u201d is eligible to vote. Voters will decide whether to change that to say \u201conly a citizen of the United States\u201d can vote. \u201cIt has to say \u2018only,\u2019 so it\u2019s clear that\u2019s what we mean,\u201d said Paul Jacob, chairman of Americans for Citizen Voting, which has advocated ballot initiatives in North Carolina and other states. \u201cWe\u2019re really pushing back against cities around the country that are pushing noncitizen voting and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s let the people decide that,\u2019\u201d he said. Washington, DC, is one of several localities that allow noncitizens to participate in local elections. Others include San Francisco; Takoma Park, Maryland, a liberal suburb just outside the nation\u2019s capital; and three cities in Vermont. A New York City law that would have allowed voting on local issues by some 800,000 legal permanent residents and people with authorization to work in US was struck down by two courts as violating the state constitution, following a legal challenge from the Republican National Committee and others. The City Council has appealed to New York state\u2019s highest court. The RNC recently filed a lawsuit challenging a noncitizen voting ordinance in school board and budget elections in another municipality, Burlington, Vermont \u2013 the state\u2019s largest city. \u201cAmericans should decide American elections,\u201d RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement announcing the Burlington lawsuit. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 persistent efforts to enable noncitizen voting dilute the voices of Americans in Vermont and across the country.\u201d Voting rights experts say instances of people who aren\u2019t US citizens casting ballots are extremely rare. In Georgia, a state with nearly 8 million registered voters, state election officials in 2022 conducted an audit of its voter rolls to gauge attempts by noncitizens to register to vote. It found that 1,634 potential noncitizens\u202fhad attempted to register between 1997 and early 2022. But none was successful, according to Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state. And in North Carolina, a post-election audit of the nearly 4.8 million votes cast in the 2016 general election found evidence that 41 noncitizens with permanent legal status in the US had voted. Still, the issue is a potentially powerful motivator\u00a0for GOP voters. Among Republican-aligned registered voters, immigration ranked behind only the economy as a top issue, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April. And a recent Marquette Law School poll of registered Wisconsin voters found that 52% said Trump would do better on immigration and border security, compared with just 28% who thought Biden would. Noncitizen voting is \u201ca good issue for Republicans to drive,\u201d said Charles Franklin, who oversees the Marquette poll. \u201cTrump is combining multiple elements of immigration to make a powerful rhetorical connection between the border crisis and vote fraud and manipulation of elections,\u201d he said. A Supreme Court hurdle to proof-of-citizenship push Amid the ballot initiatives banning noncitizen voting is a separate but related push to require that prospective voters provide documents showing their citizenship to register to vote. Louisiana is the most recent state to adopt such a law, and the New Hampshire legislature has sent such a measure to Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s desk, but it is unclear whether he will sign it. Republicans hold the executive and legislative levers of power in both states. Long-running Republican efforts to impose such mandates are constrained by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion, authored by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, that limited when a state could implement such a requirement. The ruling allows\u202ffor demands of citizenship documents from voters casting ballots in state elections but says that for federal elections, states are obligated to accept a federal voter registration form that currently does not require proof of citizenship. Only Arizona \u2013 where voters approved a 2004 ballot initiative at the center of the 2013 case \u2013 has set up the type of two-track election system that allows it to require proof of citizenship for state elections. It\u2019s unclear whether Louisiana will seek to implement its newly passed requirement for federal elections. The GOP-backed proof-of-citizenship bill in the US House would override the 2013 ruling by amending the National Voter Registration Act. But congressional Republicans would be unable to enact the legislation absent a GOP trifecta in Washington. In the meantime, litigation is ongoing around a 2022 Arizona law that would impose the proof-of-citizenship requirement for voters in the presidential election and for ballots submitted by mail, with the RNC intervening in the case to defend the requirement. The judge in the case has blocked the proof-of-citizenship requirement, and Republicans are asking an appeals court to reinstate it for this year\u2019s election. The judge upheld other aspects of the law, including much of its requirement that county recorders use various databases to check for indications that a person seeking to register is a noncitizen. Election experts have concerns that some databases are outdated and ill-suited for such an analysis. Opponents of proof-of-citizenship requirements say that, without certain fail-safes or exceptions, such rules could lead to citizens being wrongfully disenfranchised because they lack access to the types of documents that meet the requirement. A newly released survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and other groups found that 9% of voting-age citizens don\u2019t have or would have difficulty accessing documents proving their citizenship and that 2% of voting-age Americans don\u2019t have any form of such documents. The people who could be disenfranchised by such a requirement would likely be very old and very young Americans, citizens on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale, and low-frequency voters, according to Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor who has worked on voting issues in Democratic administrations. Noting that some of those voters lean Republican, Levitt said of the GOP officials pushing the measures:\u202f\u201cIn order to counter a stereotype \u2013 and maybe a tiny trinkle of wrongdoing \u2013 they may be hurting a larger group of eligible voters, and maybe even their own voters.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good officially filed a recount petition Thursday in Goochland Circuit Court for the June 18 Republican primary in Virginia\u2019s 5th\u00a0Congressional District. Certified results by the Virginia Board of Elections show Good 374 votes behind state Sen. John McGuire. Good\u2019s campaign said in a statement Thursday that it had been \u201coverwhelmed by the outpouring of support for the campaign to move ahead with the recount process.\u201d \u201cIn a race with nearly 63,000 votes that is separated by a 0.6% margin, Republican\u00a0voters across the 5th District deserve to know that all legal votes have been accurately counted,\u201d Good posted on social media last week. The congressman faced a fierce effort to knock him out from a broad swath of the GOP in what became the most expensive House Republican primary of the cycle to date. As one of the chief architects of the move to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker last fall, Good drew the ire of McCarthy\u2019s allies, who spent millions seeking revenge. Good also lost former President Donald Trump\u2019s support after he endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. The race for the 5th District, which encompasses Charlottesville and parts of south-central Virginia, highlighted two contrarian trends seen in Republican primaries this primary cycle: a backlash against GOP extremism and a deeper embrace of the former president. Last month, South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, another target of McCarthy\u2019s revenge, fended off a primary challenge from an opponent backed by the former speaker and his allies. Mace, though, had Trump\u2019s support in her race. Other efforts to oust House Republican incumbents \u2013 led by Good\u2019s own Freedom Caucus colleagues \u2013 have also failed this year. Congressmen such as Texas\u2019 Tony Gonzales, Nebraska\u2019s Don Bacon and South Carolina\u2019s William Timmons have prevailed over hard-line primary challengers. But Good faced steep odds heading into Election Day. The candidates and outside groups poured more than $14 million in ad spending into the race. Groups opposing Good spent about $7.5 million, while those backing the incumbent spent $5.6 million on their efforts. One anti-Good ad painted him as disloyal to Trump and featured a clip of him criticizing the former president. Others targeted his votes against government funding bills. McGuire also narrowly outraised Good through May 29, federal records show, bringing in $1.2 million to his opponent\u2019s $1.1 million. Good had to weather direct attacks from Trump, who held a tele-rally for McGuire on the eve of the election in which he attacked the incumbent for not being sufficiently supportive. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me,\u201d Trump told supporters on the call. Good had sought to get back into Trump\u2019s good graces once it became clear that the former president, and not DeSantis, would be the 2024 Republican nominee. He even appeared in New York City outside Trump\u2019s hush money trial, along with other Republicans seeking to show their support and devotion to Trump. Both Good and McGuire rode in Trump\u2019s motorcade on the way to the Manhattan courthouse. Despite those efforts, Trump declared on social media that Good was \u201cBAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign also sent the congressman\u2019s team a cease-and-desist letter over signage that it said falsely implied that the former president had endorsed Good. And less than a week before Election Day, Trump appeared in an ad boosting McGuire and urging voters to turn out for a \u201cbig and very important primary election.\u201d \u201cJohn McGuire is an American hero who served as a Navy SEAL. He\u2019s strong on the border. Everyone needs to get out and vote for John McGuire,\u201d Trump said in the ad. Good may not be the only House Republican incumbent with a primary heading for a recount. In Utah\u2019s 2nd District, GOP Rep. Celeste Maloy leads challenger Colby Jenkins by 214 votes out of more than 107,000 cast in the June 25 primary, according to unofficial state election results. Under state law, that margin is within the threshold for Jenkins to request a recount after the state conducts its canvass on July 22.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/bob-good-recount-virginia-primary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fact-check-biden-campaign-j-d-vance-heritage-foundation", "text": "In two social media posts on Tuesday, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign distorted a quote from Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to inaccurately make it seem as if Vance had been praising a conservative think tank\u2019s\u00a0Project 2025\u00a0initiative and expressing support for a nationwide abortion ban and cuts to Social Security. Both of the\u00a0\u201cBiden-Harris HQ\u201d\u00a0posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, included a nine-second video of Vance \u2013 a\u00a0possible Republican vice presidential candidate\u00a0\u2013 saying the following in a 2023 speech:\u00a0\u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all of the Heritage Foundation for 50 years of incredible work on conservative policy.\u201d\u00a0Roberts is the president of the think tank. In\u00a0one of the posts, the \u201cBiden-Harris HQ\u201d account claimed that the video showed Vance complimenting Project 2025 in particular.\u00a0Project 2025\u00a0is an extensive Heritage Foundation blueprint for how former President Donald Trump, if elected again, could radically reshape the executive branch and implement right-wing policies. The Biden campaign claimed in\u00a0the other post\u00a0that the video showed Vance praising two unpopular policy proposals. The post said: \u201cTrump VP contender JD Vance thanks Project 2025 leaders for their \u2018incredible work\u2019 of creating a plan for Trump to ban abortion nationwide and cut Social Security.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Both of the Biden campaign posts are false.\u00a0The full video\u00a0of Vance\u2019s speech to the Heritage Foundation shows that he did not mention Project 2025, abortion, or Social Security at all; the 2023 speech was almost entirely about foreign policy, with a dash of criticism of progressives. And the Biden campaign misleadingly edited the Vance sentence it purported to quote, using ellipses to omit the fact that Vance was broadly praising the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work over the last five decades rather than endorsing any particular recent initiative or proposal. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. An edited quote The Biden campaign edited Vance\u2019s quote to make it read as follows:\u00a0\u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all the Heritage Foundation for\u2026 incredible work on [our] policy.\u201d That\u2019s a distortion. Here, again, is what Vance actually said: \u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all of the Heritage Foundation for 50 years of incredible work on conservative policy.\u201d So the Biden campaign removed the words \u201c50 years of\u201d and \u201cconservative,\u201d and added the word \u201cour,\u201d to make it sound like Vance was conveying praise of current policies Vance himself had adopted \u2013 rather than general praise for Heritage\u2019s decades of contributions to the conservative movement. What Project 2025 says and what Vance says\u00a0 Vance did\u00a0say\u00a0near the beginning of the speech that the Heritage Foundation \u201cis going to play a major role in helping us figure out how to govern, at the White House, at the Senate, at the House and all across our great country.\u201d But the full Project 2025\u00a0policy document, a 920-page tome called \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\u201d was\u00a0not released until the day after Vance\u2019s speech, which he delivered on April 20, 2023. That Project 2025 policy document\u00a0barely mentions Social Security, let alone makes significant proposals on the subject. On abortion, the policy document calls for the Justice Department to enforce a law, first\u00a0passed in the 19th century, that criminalizes the mailing of abortion pills and any other items used in abortions. Critics have\u00a0warned\u00a0that strict enforcement of this law could create a de facto national abortion ban without requiring Congress to pass new legislation. On NBC this past weekend, Vance said he supported the recent Supreme Court decision that allowed abortion medication mifepristone to continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit to a doctor. On CBS in May 2024, he\u00a0avoided taking a position\u00a0when asked what minimum national standard on abortion he would support, nodding toward Trump\u2019s stated position that abortion policy will be determined by individual states. Vance is opposed to abortion; on the website for his 2022 campaign for the Senate, he\u00a0declared himself\u00a0\u201c100 percent pro-life\u201d and called for \u201celiminating abortion.\u201d However, he\u00a0said\u00a0on CNN in December 2023: \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans. They just don\u2019t. And I say that as a person who wants to protect as many unborn babies as possible. We have to provide exceptions for life of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fact-check-biden-campaign-j-d-vance-heritage-foundation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_house-vote-fine-garland", "text": "The House on Thursday failed to pass a GOP-pushed resolution\u00a0to fine Attorney General Merrick Garland. The vote was 210 to 204, with four Republicans\u00a0voting against it. Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said that she plans to reintroduce the resolution against Garland shortly after it failed on the House floor. \u201cWe are very confident it will pass,\u201d Luna, of Florida, said. \u201cJust because it went down the first time doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t actually pass the second time.\u201d The move is an extension of the fight over the audio tapes of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with former special counsel Robert Hur, who did not charge the president but called him\u00a0\u201ca sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d The White House asserted executive privilege over the tapes, but Republicans still held Garland in contempt of Congress and have since filed a lawsuit in court. CNN has also sued for the tapes. The resolution states that \u201cthe Speaker of the House of Representatives shall impose a fine, which may not be paid with appropriated funds, on Attorney General Garland of $10,000 per day, until such time as Attorney General Garland complies with the subpoena of the House of Representatives by turning over the audio tapes.\u201d Luna\u00a0originally suggested her legislation would use a rare process\u00a0referred to as \u201cinherent contempt\u201d that hasn\u2019t\u00a0been utilized\u00a0in modern times, though the legislation was later rewritten to only charge a fine. Former President Donald Trump put pressure on Republicans to back the move, writing on Truth Social this week, \u201cI AGREE with Anna Paulina Luna and the many House Members who think Merrick Garland should be held in INHERENT CONTEMPT for refusing to release the Biden Tapes even though they were subpoenaed!\u201d With the \u201cinherent contempt\u201d legislation,\u00a0Luna had wanted to\u00a0direct the House sergeant at arms to take Garland into custody for not turning over\u00a0the audio tapes since the GOP effort to hold Garland in contempt of Congress has gone nowhere. But the rare move was far-fetched and unlikely to pass in a narrow\u00a0Republican majority. In their closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday, House GOP leadership said the conference should let the Democratic chaos over Biden continue to dominate the news cycle and not move forward with inherent contempt, multiple sources told CNN. Luna and some of her colleagues said during the meeting that they wanted to move forward with it anyway, the sources added. But then Luna\u00a0said\u00a0that she would be moving a different kind of resolution to fine Garland. \u201cAfter speaking to the speaker, he said, \u2018Look, I will support a resolution that brings a $10,000-a-day fine to be personally paid by Garland for every day he avoids his subpoena,\u2019 and then ultimately, that is a really incredible accountability mechanism,\u201d Luna said on Newsmax. \u201cSo for people saying, \u2018Why isn\u2019t Garland going to jail?,\u2019 you guys have to understand that I\u2019m only one member of Congress and that we need multiple members to vote for this,\u201d she added. The monthslong clash between the House GOP and DOJ began when the trio of Republican-led committees leading the impeachment inquiry into the president\u00a0subpoenaed\u00a0the department in February for transcripts, documents and audio recordings related to Hur\u2019s investigation. The department has made the majority of the subpoenaed materials available to House Republicans, including transcripts of the special counsel\u2019s interviews with Biden and his ghostwriter, and allowing Hur to testify on Capitol Hill in\u00a0March. DOJ has\u00a0stood by\u00a0its decision not to release the audio files of the interviews, claiming that Republicans have not established a legitimate legislative purpose for demanding them. The Justice Department has also argued that the specific privacy concerns related to\u00a0an audio recording of an interview\u00a0are\u00a0distinct from those of a written transcript, and that the release of such an audio file could dissuade cooperation from future witnesses in criminal investigations.

Salimdzhon Nasriddinov, 53, and Nikolay Goltsev, 38, could each face up to 20 years for conspiracy to commit export control violations in connection with a global procurement scheme on behalf of sanctioned Russian entities, including some affiliated with the Russian military, prosecutors from the US attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of New York said Tuesday. \u201cThe defendants shipped millions of dollars of U.S. electronics critical to the missiles and drones Russia uses\u00a0to attack Ukraine, and they now face U.S. prison time for their scheme,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a news release.

A co-defendant in the case, Kristina Puzyreva, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the export scheme, prosecutors said, and she now awaits sentencing.

In all, they provided more than $7 million worth of material support to the Kremlin, according to Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ivan J. Arvelo, coordinating more than 300 shipments of restricted electronics that were used on the Russian battlefield. Authorities seized around $1.68 million dollars in connection with the scheme, prosecutors say.

{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_irs-back-taxes-millionaires", "text": "The Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that it has collected more than $1 billion in past-due taxes from millionaires since last fall \u2013 thanks to a ramp up of enforcement efforts funded by the Democrat-backed Inflation Reduction Act that passed Congress nearly two years ago. The Biden administration is eager to show how the IRS is using the money to crack down on wealthy tax cheats and improve taxpayers services. Republicans, who have criticized the funding as wasteful spending, have made several efforts to chip away at the 10-year investment provided by the legislation. Last fall, the IRS launched an initiative to collect from wealthy individuals who have not paid the taxes they owe. The agency identified about 1,600 taxpayers with more than $1 million in income and more than $250,000 in tax debt. To date, more than $1 billion has been recovered from those individuals, and the effort is ongoing. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRS did not have the staffing or resources to pursue high-income earners that the agency knew owed taxes, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said on a call with reporters. \u201cThe taxes were clearly owed by these people, but we didn\u2019t have the people or the resources to follow up with them,\u201d Werfel said. The process of collecting past-due taxes starts with a letter to the taxpayer\u2019s home. They are given a certain amount of time to either pay the back taxes or dispute the matter. The rest of the process varies depending on the taxpayer\u2019s situation. Targeting wealthy tax cheats The IRS has launched a series of initiatives over the past two years to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. For example, it is ramping up audits of wealthy taxpayers, corporations and large business partnerships by hiring more staff and using artificial intelligence. The agency is also examining the personal use of corporate jets. Some of the funding from the Inflation Reduction Act is being used to modernize taxpayer services. As a result, the agency was able to answer 1 million more calls this year than it did during the previous tax season. Efforts to\u00a0digitize the agency\u2019s 1 billion pieces of paper\u00a0are also underway. Earlier this year, the IRS launched a pilot version of its own tax filing service that allowed Americans to file their returns for free directly with the IRS. More than 140,000 people used the program,\u00a0known as Direct File, to successfully file their tax returns and the IRS plans to expand the program next year. Battles over IRS funding The Inflation Reduction Act, which passed without any Republican votes, approved about $80 billion for the IRS over a 10-year period. But Republicans have made several efforts to claw back the money. In a\u00a0deal to address the debt ceiling\u00a0and avoid a US default last year, Democrats agreed to allow for $20 billion of the Inflation Reduction Act funds to be rescinded. In January, Democrats conceded an\u00a0acceleration of the $20 billion cut\u00a0in an effort to get a full-year federal spending law passed in time to avoid a partial government\u00a0shutdown.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/irs-back-taxes-millionaires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_biden-replacement-process-dnc", "text": "While a slow drip of Democrats is calling for President Joe Biden to step aside in the 2024 race, an untold number seems to be hoping he will take a look at the polling that suggests he stands a good chance of losing the general election and read the room. An interview Thursday with Rep. Gerry Connolly, the longtime Virginia Democrat, was telling. Connolly clearly had no interest in calling on Biden to step down and expressed concern about him being treated with dignity and respect. But when asked by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju if Biden would be the Democratic candidate next week, Connolly said this: Comments like these give the impression of Democrats gently trying to lead their old bull to the conclusion he should drop out. What happens if Biden does decide to drop out? I talked to Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has written extensively as an academic about the primary process and is also deeply involved with the Democratic Party, where she serves on the Rules and Bylaws Committee. She told me how the process of replacing Biden would work considering nearly all of the 3,949 pledged convention delegates are currently pledged to support him. What\u2019s below are excerpts of a longer conversation conducted by phone. Is it unprecedented for a president to face this kind of challenge? KAMARCK: No, it\u2019s not unprecedented. You had it with (Jimmy) Carter. An incumbent president who everybody thought was going to lose, and so there was a check to him (by Sen. Edward Kennedy at the Democratic National Convention in 1980). Certainly LBJ (in 1968) was forced to step down, or he thought he was forced to step down, by a bad showing in the New Hampshire primary and his inability to win over the trust of the anti-war movement. So, yes, presidents have been in trouble before. They\u2019ve never been in trouble for this reason, and never so late in the process. Is it too late to replace Biden? KAMARCK: No, it is not too late to replace him. Sort of legally, according to party rules, he could be replaced anytime up to the roll call at the convention. Politically, it\u2019s very hard to replace him, because with the exception of his vice president, none of the people mentioned have risen to national stature. And their ability to talk to the Alabama delegates, as well as the Maine delegates as well as the Utah delegates is very truncated. And they don\u2019t have time to develop it. We\u2019re just running out of time. (NOTE: Governors like Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, Maryland\u2019s Wes Moore and California\u2019s Gavin Newsom are popular in their states and seen as potential future presidential candidates.) So you think the only viable replacement is Vice President Kamala Harris? KAMARCK: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s not according to the rules or anything, but realistically\u2026 think about who these 4,000 people are. First of all, they\u2019re all very loyal Biden people. So this would require Biden dropping out. Secondly, because she\u2019s been a vice president, she knows them, right? My guess is, of those 4,000 people, she\u2019s actually met a lot of them. That\u2019s not the case for anybody else who\u2019s been mentioned. The 2028 bench is a very strong bench, which is good for the party, but none of them have gotten out of their states yet. Who are the delegates to the DNC who select the party\u2019s nominee? KAMARCK: In most states, they\u2019re elected in congressional district conventions, which follow the primary. (They) file to run as delegates, and then they show up at a certain high school or someplace in their district, bringing as many of their friends and colleagues and supporters as they can. They\u2019re nominated, and they run for the delegate slots. Everybody is elected. And this is very important, because there\u2019s a lot of bullsh** running around about this being a group of elites. These people are the social studies teacher who\u2019s an active union member. These people are a leader in the pro-choice movement, or they\u2019re a county commissioner or a state delegate or something like that. These people tend to be local notables, and they tend to be very politically astute and politically active, because they\u2019ve got to run and get elected. (NOTE: There is also a much smaller group of superdelegates, or \u201cautomatic delegates,\u201d who get delegate status due to their position in the party, but who do not vote for the presidential nominee on the first ballot at the convention unless there is a consensus nominee.) How strong is the 3,949 delegates\u2019 pledge or commitment to Joe Biden? KAMARCK: The rule says \u2013 and the rule has been in effect since the 1984 convention, so it\u2019s long-standing \u2013 that delegates shall, and the operative words are, \u201cin all good conscience vote for the person they were selected to represent.\u201d It\u2019s never been tested. There\u2019s no legal history on what \u2018in all good conscience\u2019 means. Does it mean you just suddenly don\u2019t like the guy? I think probably not. Does it mean you think he\u2019s going to lose and the party will lose? We don\u2019t really know what it means because, since it was put in the rules and the \u2018robot rule\u2019 died, this has never happened. We\u2019ve never had a convention where a lot of people voted against the person that they got elected with. (NOTE: Kamarck writes more for Brookings Thursday about the \u2018in good conscience clause\u2019 and what preceded it, the so-called \u2018robot rule,\u2019 by which delegates were expected to act, essentially, like robots for the candidate who won their state\u2019s primary.) When were the most recent convention fights? KAMARCK: You can go to 1980. The Carter-Kennedy fight was a big fight. It was a real fight on the convention floor. It was bitter. It was angry. Kennedy brought a lot of stuff to the table. In the end, Carter prevailed, but he fought it out. In 1976 with the Republicans, Reagan challenged President Ford. That was a great, big fight. They were very close in delegates, and Reagan lost narrowly and then conceded. Those are the two big ones. You don\u2019t have to go way back in history to see conventions where there was a fight for the nomination. Should Democrats be talking about all of this right now? KAMARCK: I think we have to be talking about this. And I think we have to be looking at him carefully. \u2026 None of us get to see the president every single day, so it\u2019s very, very hard, and that\u2019s why I think Democrats are taking their time to think about this. I went to the Democratic congressional retreat in February, sat 20 feet away from the president and watched him answer questions from Democratic members of the House. He was fantastic. I didn\u2019t see any signs of mental fatigue or fogginess or anything like that. I thought he was fantastic. That very day that I was there, the Hur report came out. It was a very surreal experience to see this report come across the wires on my phone, and to be watching the man who was quite in command of everything. I think there\u2019s a human element to this that everybody\u2019s missing, which is that these things can develop quickly. It\u2019s really hard to tell how serious it is when you\u2019re not with him every day. And so people are being cautious. What would the roll call look like? It\u2019s not clear what Democrats\u2019 roll call will look like at the moment. The Democratic Party is considering a proposal to do a virtual roll call vote weeks before the Chicago convention is set to begin. That plan was originally hatched as a way to\u00a0comply with an early ballot access deadline in\u00a0Ohio. In the meantime,\u00a0Ohio passed a law loosening that deadline. Party leaders may yet carry on with the plan as a way to squash questions about Biden. Read more about that from\u00a0CNN\u2019s Arit John and Ethan Cohen. Democrats who sit on various committees will make those decisions at meetings in the coming weeks. The process for roll call votes is spelled out in a document, the Call for Convention, which spells out the technical rules that do not begin to seem important unless Biden drops out and the nomination is contested. Candidates for president must be nominated, for instance, by between 300-600 delegates, although not more than 50 per state. Superdelegates are restricted from voting in the first round of voting, but only if there is not a consensus nominee. A simple majority of delegates can select a nominee. Et cetera. It should be noted, though, that any of these rules can be changed by a majority of the convention. KAMARCK: The fact of the matter is that these people will descend on Chicago around August 19 and the convention will begin. And everything that goes on between now and then is just straight old politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/biden-replacement-process-dnc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Michael Bennet on Tuesday evening voicing the concerns other Democrats have shared privately. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith from Washington, agreed with that landslide assessment and implored Biden to reconsider. \u201cDon\u2019t let this be your legacy, that you refused to step down and got him back in the White House,\u201d Smith said, referring to Trump, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cthe Situation Room.\u201d And New York Rep. Ritchie Torres \u2014 a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been strongly supportive of Biden \u2014 put the potential down-ballot effects of a Biden candidacy bluntly. \u201cIf we are going on a political\u00a0suicide\u00a0mission, then we should at least be honest about it,\u201d he told CNN. Clooney: step aside to \u2018save\u2019 democracy George Clooney, the actor and Democratic fundraiser, is a Biden ally who spent time with him in Los Angeles and cohosted a record-breaking fundraiser for the president\u2019s campaign recently. The Biden that disastrously appeared on the debate stage is the same one that he saw in California, Clooney wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday. Now he argues that Biden needs to step aside so that capable Democrats can come forward to compete for the nomination or face losing control of the entire government. Democrats have been so \u201cterrified\u201d of a second Trump term that they ignored warning signs about Biden during the primary, Clooney said. \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\u201d Clooney wrote, appealing to Biden\u2019s sense of duty. He\u2019s not the only bold-faced Hollywood name raising the alarm. Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas, both Democratic fundraisers, are also on the record. And there are other fundraising concerns: Organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. A test every day Biden told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos during a high-stakes interview last week that he doesn\u2019t need to take a cognitive test and prove his fitness to lead because every day in the presidency is a cognitive test. That\u2019s going to be Biden\u2019s curse going forward. No matter how many fiery teleprompter speeches he gives, he likely won\u2019t be able to suddenly walk without shuffling or talk in conversation with the steadiness he once did. The next of his daily tests will come Thursday, when the president conducts a rare solo news conference at the conclusion of a NATO meeting taking place in Washington. Biden should be talking about his successful efforts to expand the treaty organization and mobilize it to stand up to Russia, but instead he will face question after question about his fitness to do the job. Stephanopoulos, by the way, who spent time in direct contact with the president, told a passerby secretly recording him on a New York City street that he doesn\u2019t think Biden can serve another four years. Next week, Biden will sit down with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt for an interview that will tape and air\u00a0Monday, the network announced Fear of a \u2018landslide\u2019 Bennet, the Colorado Democrat, became the first senator in his party to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester \u2014 the two most vulnerable senators facing reelection \u2014 also said Biden would not win during a meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar, CNN reported Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country,\u201d Bennet said on CNN. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s critically important, for us, to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\u201d Democrats are already in a difficult position in the race to control the Senate, since they are defending a larger number of seats than Republicans this cycle. About a third of the Senate is up for election every two years. CNN\u2019s senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein argued Tuesday that a Biden loss could cost Democrats the Senate, which would reverberate for decades since it would give aging conservative justices on the Supreme Court, like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, cover to resign and solidify the court\u2019s conservative majority. Trump is currently ahead CNN\u2019s Road to 270 assessment of the electoral map shows Trump in position to win the election. Georgia, Michigan and Nevada \u2014 all states that Biden won in 2020 \u2014 are all leaning toward Republicans. If Trump wins those three state and all the states he won in 2020, he would have 272 electoral votes, enough to win the election. CNN Senior data reporter Harry Enten said polling clearly shows Trump is ahead at this point. But he notes that polling this far from the election does not generally represent the final vote. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at this data we should keep in mind that it\u2019s still just July and the election is in November,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how things shift as things go on from here.\u201d Is Biden hearing this? The Democratic leader in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, has publicly backed Biden, but he has told nervous lawmakers he will take their concerns to the White House, according to CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju. But Jeffries\u00a0brushed off questions about whether Biden is the most effective nominee and said he has no plans to meet with him on Wednesday. \u201cOver the last few days, the members of the House Democratic Caucus have had conversations that are candid, constructive and clear-eyed about the path forward, which primarily includes doing everything we can to make sure that we take back the majority in November of this year,\u201d he told reporters on his way into a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some Democrats want to move on from this debate, worrying that it only boosts Trump. \u201cDonald Trump and the Republicans have loved every minute of watching this discussion,\u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents the battleground state of Michigan, told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_biden-nato-analysis", "text": "The NATO summit was long planned to celebrate the alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary, to lock in longterm military support for Ukraine and even to future-proof the West against a possible second term for Donald Trump. But no one expected the meeting in Washington this week to turn into a public test of 81-year-old President Joe Biden\u2019s health and cognitive capacity with his reelection campaign facing an existential moment after his disastrous debate performance. Biden\u2019s leadership of NATO and lifeline to Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion make him the most significant presidential trustee of the alliance since President George H.W. Bush. But his achievements, including Sweden and Finland\u2019s entry into the group, will be eclipsed at the summit by his battle to save his political future. Every step Biden takes, every gesture he makes, and every word he utters will be under intense scrutiny, especially in unscripted moments after the image of an aged and at times incoherent commander in chief was burned into the minds of 50 million viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta late last month. A president who is older than the alliance itself will be under enormous pressure to show vigor and mental clarity at a solo news conference on Thursday. Any hint of confusion or weakness could spark a fresh round of panic among Democrats and derail Biden\u2019s aggressive effort to quell talk of him abandoning his campaign. The president can expect a volley of questions about his health, his medical records and whether he has been hiding the true details of his condition from journalists infuriated by the White House\u2019s handling of the debate fallout. The press conference will also be a must-see event for Democrats who are demanding he do far more to prove he is fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, warned Monday evening, \u201cWe need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job.\u201d It was a strikingly strong statement by the Washington state Democrat that underscored the vulnerability of Biden\u2019s position. She added: \u201cAt this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.\u201d Biden will also have an important audience overseas. The effects of the president\u2019s advancing age are not just an issue for his political future; they are now the West\u2019s problem given that he is the last defense against a stunning comeback by Trump, who spent his first term berating NATO allies and cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has suggested he would let Moscow \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d and would not honor NATO\u2019s sacred Article 5 mutual defense principle if he considered that a member state had not met the alliance\u2019s defense spending guidelines. World leaders will be keen to make their own assessment of Biden Biden\u2019s debacle created a new complication for US allies already formulating plans for a possibility that many of them dread \u2014 a Trump victory in November. The world leaders who will spend hours with Biden this week are therefore certain to make their own assessments of the president and his political hopes. Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO, said Biden\u2019s partners will arrive in Washington looking for both political and strategic assurances about Biden and the United States\u2019 future role as the leader of NATO. \u201cIs it going to be President Biden? Is he capable of that? Is he going to run for reelection, is he going to get reelected? If so, what does that look like?\u201d Volker told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Monday. Allies are also looking toward an uncertain future, Volker said. \u201cThen they worry \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t do that and it\u2019s former president Donald Trump coming back, what does that mean for US support for NATO, US support for Ukraine?\u201d Foreign diplomats and governments are loath to speak about Biden\u2019s plight on the record out of a desire to avoid being dragged into domestic US politics. But diplomats from Europe, Asia and the Middle East expressed disbelief at his debate showing, CNN reported last week. And looking forward to the summit, one European diplomat said leaders from the continent would stay polite and seek to avoid any accusations of interference or taking sides in US politics. But the person added: \u201cBeneath this cool surface, I believe (the) Biden debate is very crucial. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe there are many Europeans who could see how Biden could still be a successful candidate.\u201d Another European diplomat said that \u201cevery leader arriving in Washington in the coming days will ask questions about (Biden\u2019s position) and there will be lot of speculation, but the NATO echo chamber doesn\u2019t change the US domestic political calculus in any way.\u201d The furor over Biden\u2019s age is just the latest shock to rattle the certainty that NATO partners placed in the United States as the alliance\u2019s senior member for more than 60 years \u2013 through and after the Cold War until Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House. America\u2019s political paroxysms have left many allies, especially in Europe, considering how to protect themselves in an age when Washington is just as likely to be an agent of volatility as stability. Some question whether the US will be there to defend them anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality that we have to be prepared for the unpredictability of the US ally,\u201d a European official said. US officials reject any suggestion of concern among Biden\u2019s partners about his capacity to lead the alliance, even as multiple polls show most Americans believe he is too old to serve a second term. \u201cForeign leaders have seen Joe Biden up close and personal for the last three years. They know who they are dealing with and how effective he\u2019s been,\u201d a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity. The administration\u2019s national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday denied that foreign leaders needed to be assured about Biden\u2019s capacities. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all. Quite the contrary,\u201d he said. The critical national security substance of the summit is unlikely to be adversely affected by Biden\u2019s political crisis since diplomats and top military brass have been thrashing out deliverables for months. They\u2019ve focused on institutionalizing aid to Ukraine and on the future relationship between the alliance and the Kyiv government and its desire to eventually join the alliance. After months of diplomatic haggling, a draft text of the final summit communique describes Ukraine as having an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to membership, three sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN. Biden\u2019s political storm shows no sign of abating These are surreal days in Washington, with a sitting president waging a battle to remain atop his party\u2019s ticket less than four months from Election Day. On Monday, the president insisted he wasn\u2019t going anywhere even as worried Democratic lawmakers discussed whether Biden would cost his party the House and the Senate as well as the presidency if he remains their presidential candidate. Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, joined lawmakers calling for Biden to fold his reelection bid. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message. The president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way,\u201d the Washington state Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday. After days of conflicting statements about the president\u2019s medical situation, the White House, meanwhile, insisted that it was \u201cnot warranted\u201d for the president to have a new cognitive test and didn\u2019t fully explain why a physician who specializes in Parkinson\u2019s disease had held a meeting with the president\u2019s doctor earlier this year. Biden had earlier called into MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d to underscore his refusal to cede his campaign in a manner that indicated that any subsequent request from Democratic leaders for him to leave the ticket would cause an ugly political spectacle. Biden also seized on the upcoming summit as proof of his leadership skills and success as president, while his campaign sought to use his turn on the global stage on US soil to reset the comparison between him and Trump \u2014 the core theme of his campaign, which has been obliterated by his dismal night at the debate. \u201cThe rest of the world is looking \u2014 our allies are looking for US leadership. Who else \u2014 who else do you think could step in here and do this?\u201d Biden said on MSNBC. In an interview with ABC News on Friday, the president also billed himself as essential to global security. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that put NATO together, the future. No one thought I could expand it. I\u2019m the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen,\u201d Biden said. The president has not shut Putin down \u2014 the brutal Russian daylight air attack on Kyiv that hit a children\u2019s hospital on Monday is proof of that. But he has mustered the most effective arming of a Russian adversary since the US backed the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet Union in the 1980s and has indeed reinvigorated NATO and presided over the two Nordic nations entering the alliance. On the eve of the summit, Biden\u2019s campaign distributed a memo lauding his leadership in keeping Kyiv standing more than two years after the Russian invasion. \u201cDonald Trump is a threat to NATO, a gift to Putin and a wrecking ball to global peace, democracy and human rights,\u201d the memo read. The campaign also pointed out the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s frequent genuflecting toward Putin. \u201cThe eyes of the world will be on the NATO summit this week, where Joe Biden has strengthened, expanded and led the NATO Alliance against Putin\u2019s violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and unwarranted aggression.\u201d It will not be much comfort to Biden, but he is not the only NATO leader who is politically weakened. French President Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Washington after triggering a new era of political instability. His ordering of snap legislative elections to thwart the rise of the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen failed to produce a governing majority and empowered the far-left. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is weakened after his party and coalition took a beating in European Parliament elections. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing intense speculation about his future ahead of next year\u2019s general election after his Liberal Party lost an election in a Toronto district it had held for decades. The thorny question of Biden\u2019s age will also be underscored in summit photos since many of the leaders are far younger than a president born during World War II whose foreign policy expertise is honed from a half century of political experience spanning the Cold War and the increasingly restive period ever since. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is 47, for example. And Macron is 46. Trudeau has been in power for nearly a decade but is still only 52. The summit will also mark the international debut of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, 61, who was elected last Thursday. Biden has been a steadfast guide for NATO ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has made the survival of global democracy the cornerstone of his presidency. But he has a far more urgent priority at the summit this week \u2013 saving himself.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democrats-virtual-roll-call-biden", "text": "The party announced May 28 it would hold a virtual roll call ahead of the Democratic National Convention to comply with Ohio law. That decision \u2013 made well before the June 27 debate \u2013 could now help tamp down efforts to convince the president to step aside after a disappointing performance last month. Amid questions of whether President Joe Biden will remain the Democratic nominee, there is also uncertainty around when delegates will vote to make his nomination official. But it has also led to a flood of questions about when and how Biden will be nominated. As of now, it\u2019s not clear how long delegates \u2013 including the nearly 4,000 pledged to Biden \u2013 will have to vote for the nominee, or when the process will start or end. According to convention nomination talking points circulated by the Democratic National Committee last week, the electronic roll call vote will happen by August 7, but no decisions have been made on the format or timing of the vote. A DNC spokesperson told CNN that no date has been decided for the electronic roll call. Biden, who\u00a0won about 99% of his party\u2019s delegates, is expected to become the official nominee when the vote is complete. The DNC\u2019s convention rules panel is expected to meet July 19 and its credentials committee is expected to meet July 21. Both meetings will be streamed on the committee\u2019s YouTube page. Originally, the electronic roll call was meant to avoid further ballot access issues for the president. Earlier this year, the office of Ohio\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose informed Democrats that their party convention, which will take place from August 19-22, would fall after the state\u2019s deadline for submitting the party\u2019s official nominee. LaRose said he would not accept a provisional certification and efforts to push back the deadline in the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature dragged. After weighing possible options, including litigation, the DNC opted to hold a virtual roll call vote. The committee stuck with the plan even after Ohio enacted a law that would push back the deadline to after the convention. On June 3, LaRose sent guidance to county election officials informing them of the new timeline. One day later, the DNC Rules and Bylaws committee approved an amendment, which was then approved by the full DNC, allowing the DNC convention\u2019s rules and credentials committees to set up the process to conduct the virtual roll call. At that June 4 meeting, DNC Rules and Bylaws committee co-chair Minyon Moore, who also chairs the national convention, argued that the Ohio legislature had proven to be \u201cuntrustworthy stewards of voting rights\u201d in the past, and raised concerns the state could undo their law delaying the certification deadline. She noted that the law delaying the deadline doesn\u2019t go into effect until August 31. \u201cWe cannot leave our democracy or our rights, or the rights of Ohio voters in their hands,\u201d Moore said in the meeting. At the time there were concerns that a virtual roll call would dampen enthusiasm at the actual convention. Carol Fowler, a DNC member on the rules and bylaws committee, urged the committee to make the experience worthwhile for delegates traveling to Chicago during the June 4 meeting. \u201cWhatever you can do to give the actual delegates in the actual convention hall the most opportunity there is to participate and to do things that mean something, not just sit there and listen to speeches,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cGive them some opportunities to vote.\u201d Moore said her team had worked with that in mind. \u201cI assure you that we will be taking all of that into account,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/democrats-virtual-roll-call-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Discussions are still underway regarding whether she will speak onstage or be a formal part of the convention program, the sources said. Melania Trump has maintained a low profile throughout her husband\u2019s campaign, having attended just two public appearances since he launched his third presidential bid \u2013 his campaign kickoff in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home and a brief appearance in March when she accompanied her husband to vote in the Florida presidential primary. A spokesperson for Melania Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The former first lady\u2019s\u00a0return to the spotlight for one of the most\u00a0high-profile\u00a0moments of\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s campaign comes as questions over\u00a0whether she will ramp up her public schedule\u00a0in the run-up to\u00a0the 2024\u00a0general\u00a0election\u00a0continue to go unanswered. She notably did not attend\u00a0any of\u00a0her husband\u2019s\u00a0court appearances in New York for his hush money trial earlier this year, nor did she appear with him for\u00a0CNN\u2019s June\u00a027\u00a0presidential debate in Atlanta. Trump campaign advisers and close allies insist that the former first lady is supportive of her husband and his political ambitions and that she has been focused on raising their, son Barron. They added that she is very selective in choosing her political appearances.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview", "text": "President Joe Biden sat down with ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos for\u00a0a high-stakes interview\u00a0on Friday, the week after a poor debate performance prompted questions about his fitness for the presidency and calls for him to withdraw from the 2024 race. Here is a fact check of some of Biden\u2019s claims in the interview. New York Times polling Biden claimed that \u201cthe New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that he gained a point in New York Times polling after the debate is false. In fact, the Times\u2019 post-debate poll, conducted with Siena College,\u00a0showed Biden doing three points worse\u00a0against former President Donald Trump than he had done in the\u00a0final Times/Siena poll before the debate. Biden\u2019s specific numbers were also wrong. He was not \u201cdown 10 points before the debate\u201d in Times/Siena polling. In fact, he was down three percentage points with likely voters and six percentage points with registered voters. In the Times/Siena poll after the debate, those margins grew to six percentage points with likely voters and nine percentage points with registered voters. Biden did acknowledge his uncertainty about the data when he said \u201cor whatever the hell it is.\u201d But he was wrong, nonetheless. Sen. Mark Warner and the presidency When Stephanopoulos noted a\u00a0Friday report in The Washington Post\u00a0that said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is trying to put together a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Biden to withdraw from the election, Biden responded, \u201cWell, Mark is a good man. We\u2019ve never had that \u2013 he also tried to get the nomination too. Mark\u2019s not \u2013 Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that \u201che also tried to get the nomination too\u201d needs context. Warner has never run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did\u00a0make extensive preparations\u00a0for a possible run for the 2008 nomination, including hiring staff and raising millions for a political action committee, but he\u00a0announced in October 2006\u00a0that he had decided not to launch a campaign after all. And he has not sought the nomination since then. Biden did run in that 2008 presidential primary, which was won by Barack Obama. Trump and bleach Biden repeated his familiar claim that Trump \u201cis a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with Covid.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim is misleading. Trump never portrayed his ill-informed and widely denounced musings about using disinfectants to address Covid-19 as advice to Americans. Rather, Trump was talking about the possibility of scientists conducting tests of this idea. Trump made his remarks, at a\u00a0press briefing in April 2020\u00a0after Bill\u00a0Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said sunlight or disinfectants like\u00a0bleach\u00a0and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces and in saliva. When Trump jumped shortly afterward to the dangerous idea of injecting disinfectants inside people\u2019s bodies, he said: \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were\u00a0slammed by medical experts\u00a0as highly dangerous, and they prompted urgent\u00a0warnings\u00a0from public health authorities and companies that sell household disinfectants. But he never actually said he was suggesting citizens go and use such products. Trump and jobs Biden repeated another one of his regular campaign claims about his Republican opponent, saying Trump was the only president other than Herbert Hoover \u201cwho lost more jobs than he created.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is true, but Biden left out some important context. While there was a\u00a0loss of about\u00a02.7\u00a0million\u00a0jobs\u00a0from the beginning of Trump\u2019s four-year term to the end, there was a gain of about 6.7 million jobs until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country about three years into that term.\u00a0 Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March 2020 and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. The US then started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million from May 2020 through December 2020, but not enough to make up the massive early-pandemic losses.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_takeaways-biden-nato-news-conference", "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday participated in the most high-stakes news conference of his political career on the sidelines of the NATO summit, aiming to convince his detractors and supporters that he is able to serve another four years in office. Biden spoke for just under an hour, calling on 10 reporters and answering 19 questions. Here are some takeaways from the news conference. Performance serves as a Rorschach test for nervous Democrats Biden\u2019s performance likely won\u2019t change many minds \u2013 Democrats who want Biden to step down are able to jump on a notable verbal gaffe he made at the beginning of the news conference, while Biden\u2019s supporters will point toward the time he spent deftly answering a variety of questions on foreign policy. Toward the beginning of the question-and-answer, Biden mistakenly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as former President Donald Trump. It was exactly the type of slip-up the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign presumably would have feared amid mounting questions surrounding his mental acuity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president did I think she was not qualified to be president,\u201d he said. The president did not correct himself. He made a similar mistake earlier in the day, accidentally calling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cPresident Putin\u201d while introducing him during a NATO event. But Biden quickly moved on, and he spent the rest of the news conference lobbing in-depth answers about questions including Russia, Israel and his economy, offering deep answers on dealing with China and US policy around Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. Biden eagerly takes on Trump Part of Biden\u2019s problem at the debate last month is that he was not able to effectively counter Trump, call out the former president\u2019s lies and distinguish himself from his predecessor while he was standing just feet away from him. He didn\u2019t have the same problem on Thursday, lashing out at Trump\u2019s record and his lack of public events since the debate. \u201cMy schedule has been full bore. I\u2019ve done \u2014 where\u2019s\u00a0Trump\u00a0been? Riding on his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball? I mean, look. He\u2019s done virtually nothing,\u201d Biden said. But Trump hasn\u2019t had to do anything since then. With the bulk of the national attention on Biden and his missteps, Trump and his campaign have made a strategic point of letting the president continue digging himself in a hole. During multiple answers, Biden turned the focus onto his opponent and even took him on during the opening statement of the news conference. Much of Biden\u2019s focus at the NATO summit was to promote how he had united the alliance after Trump did much to divide it during his term. Biden\u00a0told reporters said foreign leaders he\u2019s met at the\u00a0conference haven\u2019t expressed concerns over his fitness for office, instead expressing concern over the prospect of a second\u00a0Trump\u00a0term. \u201cI think I can I say this without sounding too self-serving\u2013 I\u2019ve not had any of my European allies come up to me and say, \u2018Joe don\u2019t run,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I hear them say is, you gotta win \u2013 you can\u2019t have this guy come forward, he\u2019d be a disaster, he\u2019d be a disaster.\u201d Biden brushes off concerns about his campaign: \u2018I\u2019m just gonna keep moving\u2019 Biden frequently brushed aside concerns about his candidacy by telling reporters he\u2019s the most qualified person to run for president. On occasions, he sounded downright mad and offended by the questions over his fitness for office and the state of his campaign. \u201cI think I\u2019m the\u00a0most\u00a0qualified\u00a0person to run for president. I beat him once and I will beat him again,\u201d Biden said, referring to Trump. He continued, \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign and so I \u2013 I\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d The length of Biden\u2019s resume has never been in doubt. The president has had more political experience than any one who has ever held or ran for the office. But what\u2019s of concern to those calling for him to step aside is not his qualifications, but his ability to govern for another term. Sixteen House Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to step aside - four of them before the news conference. But that still only represents less than 10% of the House Democratic caucus. It\u2019s no longer only the \u2018Lord Almighty\u2019 who could convince Biden to drop out One week ago, Biden defiantly swatted away any notion that he would drop from the race, telling ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could convince him to remove himself from the ticket. Biden was more restrained on Thursday. He reiterated his belief that he is the best qualified to win in November \u2013 while still admitting other Democrats could defeat Trump. Biden said his advantage against those Democrats is that they won\u2019t have to start a national campaign from scratch. \u201cI believe I\u2019m the best qualified to govern. And I think I\u2019m the best qualified to win. But there are other people could beat Trump too. But it\u2019s awful hard to start from scratch. And you know, we talk about, you know, money raised \u2013 we\u2019re not doing bad. We\u2019re gonna put $220 million in the bank. We\u2019re doing well,\u201d he said. Pressed on whether he might reconsider his stance if he was shown data that had Harris performing better against Trump, he offered some openness to that possibility. \u201cNo, unless they came back and said there\u2019s no way you can win,\u201d Biden said. That\u2019s a much different answer from last week, and signifies the intense conversations Biden has been having with his top aides since the ABC interview. He acknowledged that down-ballot Democrats may continue to disavow his name at the top of the ticket as they face tough reelection battles. \u201cIf they think that running with Biden at the top is going to hurt them, then they\u2019re going to run away,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI get it.\u201d News conference doesn\u2019t stop the bleeding as more Dems defect from Biden If the news conference was aimed at keeping lawmakers from abandoning the president, it was not successful. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim\u00a0Himes, called on Biden to step aside almost at the exact time the news conference ended. He was the first House Democrat to call on the president to leave the ticket after the news conference, but not the last. \u201cIt is because of those traits and, and in consideration of that legacy, that I hope President Biden will step away from the presidential campaign,\u201d\u00a0he said on X. Not long after Himes, California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters became the 16th Democrat on Capitol Hill to call on Biden to withdraw his candidacy. Peters is a prominent Democrat among the center-left. \u201cToday I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign,\u201d the San Diego Democrat wrote in a statement shared with CNN. This is a breaking story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/takeaways-biden-nato-news-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_obama-pelosi-biden-democrats-2024", "text": "Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have spoken privately about Joe Biden and the future of his\u00a02024\u00a0campaign. Both\u00a0the former president and ex-speaker expressed concerns about how much harder they think it\u2019s become for the president to beat Donald Trump.\u00a0Neither is quite sure what to do. Democrats are desperate for the dispiriting infighting to end so they can get back to trying to beat\u00a0the former president.\u00a0And they\u2019re begging\u00a0either Obama or Pelosi\u00a0to help them get there, aware that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0doesn\u2019t have\u00a0the trust of Biden\u00a0and\u00a0that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries doesn\u2019t have the depth of relationship to deliver the message. CNN spoke with\u00a0more than\u00a0a dozen members of Congress, operatives and multiple people in touch with both Obama and Pelosi, many of whom say that the end\u00a0for Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0feels clear and at this point it\u2019s just a matter of how it plays out, even after Thursday night\u2019s news conference. And if those two feel otherwise, several leading Democrats say, they need to say that clearly as soon as possible before even more damage is done\u00a0less than four months before the election. Many of Pelosi\u2019s colleagues are hoping that she can bring an end to the turmoil that has engulfed Democrats for the last two weeks.\u00a0And\u00a0to a good chunk of them,\u00a0that end\u00a0can come if and when she tells Biden that he has to drop out. Pelosi has spoken to Biden since the debate, but in the time since, the California Democrat\u00a0has made clear that she does not see Biden\u2019s decision to stay in\u00a0the race\u00a0as final.\u00a0But she, through an aide, declined to comment further. Obama\u2019s\u00a0decision not to make any public comment for two weeks has left a number of leading Democrats feeling like he has left them flailing by holding to the same posture that has largely defined his post-presidency. After the debate, he posted on X,\u00a0\u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d reiterating that sentiment at a fundraiser in New York for House Democrats the night after Biden\u2019s performance. The former president\u00a0hadn\u2019t even planned to make any public statement, but Biden and Obama aides coordinated to get that\u00a0post\u00a0out in a way that reflected Biden campaign talking points that Obama\u2019s first reelection debate in 2012 went badly, too, and it didn\u2019t end up ending his campaign. But Obama\u2019s deepening skepticism about his friend\u2019s ability to\u00a0win reelection is one of the worst kept secrets in Washington. When the history of this extraordinary two-week period of American politics is written, the fingerprints of Obama and Pelosi will be far more apparent than currently known, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, as the Democratic elders have served as a guidepost for a party in panic. \u201cThey are watching and waiting for President Biden to reach a decision on his own,\u201d one longtime Democrat close to all of them told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being seen as disrespectful to Biden. The Biden campaign declined to comment. Obama has been fielding more calls than he\u2019s making, people who have spoken to him say. When he does talk to anxious Democratic donors and officials, he\u2019s been listening more than talking, carefully avoiding taking positions that he assumes would quickly leak. That was also Obama\u2019s approach to the call he had\u00a0with Biden\u00a0after the debate, which the current president has suggested to others included the former president being supportive of\u00a0him\u00a0riding out the turmoil. According to others familiar with the call, though, Obama stuck to his posture of being a \u201csounding board and private counselor.\u201d He prodded. He played devil\u2019s advocate. But he did not take a position. In conversations with some Democrats over the past two weeks,\u00a0Obama has swatted away the notion that he could push Biden one direction or the other even if he wanted to, which underscores their long-running complicated, yet loyal, relationship. And it\u2019s been complicated even further during their time apart: since leaving office behind \u2013 and their weekly lunches at the White House for eight years \u2013 the two have spoken far less than some of their advisers have often intimated. If the former president did try to steer Biden to get out, people who know Obama\u00a0say,\u00a0he is aware the prism through which it could be seen. Biden has written that he felt Obama was not encouraging of his jumping in late to the Democratic primaries in the months after his son Beau died in 2015. Though Obama believes that he was trying to help his then-vice president focus on his grief and not wade into what would have been an incredibly hard\u00a0primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,\u00a0that may not be how another conversation would go. \u201cBiden would say, \u2018Well, Mr. President, you already used that chip in 2015 and it got us Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d speculated a longtime 2020 campaign aide. \u201cI think it would harden him more.\u201d Obama is also loathe to give Trump, who is forever triggered by him, any new material by getting actively involved. In the past \u2014 including during the 2020 Democratic primaries \u2014 Obama has seen his role as being the unifier who can help validate\u00a0the direction of the party\u00a0to whichever parts of the party remain skeptical. So far, he has not committed to having that role in the turmoil over whether Biden should remain the nominee, what happens if he stays, or what happens if he changes course and decides to go. \u201cWell he\u2019s known as no-drama Obama,\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat. \u201cSo if there\u2019s drama, then he\u2019s the one to deal with it.\u201d Obama\u2019s hands-off approach \u2014 at least publicly \u2014 has been seen by some close to him as a way to keep his powder dry in case he needs to have a blunt, difficult conversation with Biden. \u201cHe is going to be all in for the Democratic ticket. No matter who our nominee is, he will be busting his a** helping to make sure that person wins in November,\u201d said one person who speaks with Obama regularly. Obama has been at Biden\u2019s side during two fundraising events this year, including\u00a0at the\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0event\u00a0last month at which George Clooney would later acknowledge he was alarmed by how Biden carried himself. Biden woke up the day before the\u00a0fundraiser \u2014\u00a0after several days of G-7 meetings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and had to fly overnight across five time zones to get there, because campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg was eager to do the Hollywood-themed event, and Clooney told the campaign there was only one day he was available, given his shooting schedule. Even on the way there, Obama questioned the thinking of putting any presidential candidate through the wringer of that kind of scheduling. \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney wrote in an essay in The New York Times\u00a0this week,\u00a0imploring Biden to step aside. It was those words that infuriated some Biden loyalists, who suggested that Obama was behind Clooney\u2019s op-ed. The former president, who is friendly with the actor, was aware that it was coming but did not try to stop it.\u00a0To some Obama defenders, that was\u00a0a way of preserving his neutrality, but to some Biden loyalists, it was\u00a0a mark of deep betrayal. Obama was backstage and on stage with Biden for much longer than Clooney was. Others around at the time chalked up the shape the president was in to jet lag. The infamous video\u00a0of Obama\u00a0leading Biden off stage, people familiar say, was more a function of the former president wanting to leave. An Obama aide declined to comment and also declined to say whether his own assessment of Biden\u2019s condition remained that it was about jet lag. Pelosi re-broke the dam As House Democrats left their private caucus meeting on Tuesday morning, many felt the worst might be over for the president. Most of the anti-Biden remarks at the meeting had come from members who had already called for him to go. Then Pelosi went on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday morning for a long-scheduled appearance and took advantage of being on a show the president is known to watch to cast major doubt on his candidacy. Privately, she was telling colleagues to hold off on embarrassing Biden while the NATO leaders were in town. But even more Democrats took her comments as an open pass to issue their statements calling on Biden to step aside. Pelosi has known Biden for decades. She is older than him by three years. She has been one of his staunchest defenders, including through the 2020 primaries. She\u2019s finished as speaker and has nothing to lose. \u201cI think at this moment, if Biden ends up stepping down as the nominee, she will prove to be the most important Democratic leader,\u201d said one House Democrat. \u201cShe\u2019s the one in a situation like this, especially generationally, who has the credibility to weigh in on something that is so sensitive and important.\u201d Pelosi plans to fly back home to San Francisco on Friday.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_global-elections-roundup", "text": "A year of global elections, in which nations with half the world\u2019s population are casting votes is proving punishing for incumbents struggling with the painful economic aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the scandals and exhaustion that afflict leaders who spend years in power. Elections in recent days in France and Britain have shown disgruntled but informed electorates using democracy in novel ways through tactical voting to reshape their countries. In Iran \u2013 even amid the highly restrictive circumstances of an election choreographed by the clerical autocracy, voters sprung a surprise and a hardliner lost. So far, this mass global exercise of political self-determination has done as much to highlight the growing threats to democracy, the rule of law and the rise of populist leaders as to enshrine the principle that people should choose their leaders. In some countries, like El Salvador and Slovakia, leaders and parties with authoritarian instincts have cemented their power through the ballot box. In others, like Russia, they\u2019ve strangled the rights of voters to extend their own rule. And there are rising concerns about how new leaders with strong mandates in nations like Indonesia and Mexico could use their power to centralize authority and erode democratic structures. For leaders seeking reelection this year, there are sobering omens. Incumbency usually means vulnerability \u2014 as a landmark vote in South Africa demonstrated \u2014 and there is widespread angst in developed societies over cost-of-living crises. Populism is having another moment to mirror Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in 2016, which was quickly followed by Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the United States. But democracy\u2019s enduring capacity to channel public anger against the power of dominant leaders or to force change has also been on display from India to Senegal. And elections in Taiwan and South Korea proved the dynamism of the idea that free elections can promote stable governance. Voting around the world is leading up to a critical election in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy \u2013 the United States \u2013 in November. President Joe Biden, weakened by a disastrous debate performance that exacerbated voter concern about his age, is warning that a return to power by Trump \u2014 who tried to steal the 2020 election after losing it \u2014 poses an existential threat to the principle of government of the people, by the people and for the people across the globe. Here are some of the most significant election results so far in 2024 that underscore what may turn out to be a pivotal moment for democracy. European Union The far-right made significant gains in elections to the European Parliament in June, though the populist wave fell short of some of the direst predictions of critics who warn that the continent\u2019s democratic heritage could be at risk. Still, the fact that the ultra-conservatives\u00a0did best in European Union powerhouses France and Germany is hugely significant. Despite the shuffled political deck, the center-right European People\u2019s Party remains the biggest single force in pan-EU politics and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to secure another term. France Sweeping gains by the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen in the European elections prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to make a shock call for new legislative elections, as he pleaded with voters to neutralize the growing threat of extremism. The two round French election system once again kept the far-right out of power on Sunday but Macron\u2019s gamble didn\u2019t exactly pay off. A left-wing New Popular Front coalition emerged to foil Le Pen and the elections ended up empowering the far-left, which Macron had previously crushed with his new brand of centrist politics. An era of political turmoil now looms with a hung parliament, a likely shaky coalition and instability ahead of the next presidential election in 2027. Britain Voters last week ended the 14-year-rule of the Conservative Party marked by scandals, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and political chaos that included five different prime ministers in eight years. The new Prime Minister Keir Starmer led his Labour Party to a landmark victory but faces a tough task in mending decaying public services with government finances depleted and with the economy hampered by the impact of Brexit. Indonesia Prabowo Subianto, a former army general, won the presidential election in the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation,\u00a0which is home to its largest Muslim population. Subianto is ostensibly a supporter of Indonesia\u2019s vibrant but often fragile democracy where the military still looms as a key power player. But he has been shadowed by accusations of human rights abuses, especially during his military career during the rule of his father-in-law and dictator Suharto. India The world\u2019s largest democracy sprung a surprise that showed the power of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d even in a nation where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of squelching the freedom of assembly and the press and eroding secular guarantees in the constitution. The Hindu nationalist leader did stay in power,\u00a0but his hopes of capturing an unassailable parliamentary majority crashed. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party will now have to rely on coalition partners following a weeklong election that will be remembered for a prominent pollster bursting into tears on live television after botching an exit poll\u00a0that\u00a0missed the shock result. Pakistan The power of voters and the limits of democracy were,\u00a0meanwhile,\u00a0on show in neighboring Pakistan in February in a massive protest vote against the military that left allies of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan with the largest bloc in parliament. But two anti-Khan parties \u2014 the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan People\u2019s Party \u2013 united to keep the former cricket superstar\u2019s affiliates from forming a government. Asif Ali Zardari, the scandal-tainted husband of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,\u00a0is now serving as president with an ally as prime minister. Bangladesh Concerns about the erosion of democracy in South Asia were also intensified by the victory of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in January in an election that the United States warned was not free and fair and that was marred by the arrests of thousands of members of the opposition. Russia There were no surprises in Russia, where President Vladimir\u00a0Putin stage-managed voting to extend his one-man rule until at least 2030. The election was the first since the death of opposition figure Alexey Navalny in a prison colony. And\u00a0those allowed to stand in opposition to Putin were controlled by the Kremlin with credible opposition figures all jailed, exiled or prohibited from running. El Salvador Strongman rule was also enshrined in El Salvador \u2014 through democratic means. President Nayib Bukele,\u00a0the self-proclaimed world\u2019s \u201ccoolest dictator\u201d whose wild popularity as president is based on his purge against gangs, was overwhelmingly reelected. His dominance was boosted when his New Ideas party won a thumping congressional majority. Despite his popularity, critics warn that Bukele is seriously eroding democratic standards in his country. Mexico Similar concerns about democratic institutions are being raised in Mexico after the historic election of the country\u2019s first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum. The left-wing climate scientist\u00a0and physicist profited from the popularity of her longtime ally, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Sheinbaum, who will also be Mexico\u2019s first Jewish president when she is sworn in, has the legislative majority to push through constitutional reforms that critics say will gut independent regulatory agencies, could politicize the judiciary and lead to few checks on executive presidential power. Taiwan The dynamism of democracy in Taiwan was showcased in an election that immediately intensified tensions with China. Lai Ching-te, the previous vice president, secured a historic third consecutive presidential election victory for his Democratic Progressive Party as voters shrugged off warnings by Beijing that their choice could increase the chances\u00a0of\u00a0conflict with a mainland government that insists Taiwan is part of China. South Korea In South Korea in April, voters delivered a stirring demand for change by handing liberal opposition parties a majority in the legislature in a blow to President\u00a0Yoon\u00a0Suk Yeol and his conservatives. The election was shaped by public anger over a cost-of-living crisis and political scandals, including one swirling around the president\u2019s wife. Portugal Incumbents suffered another blow in Portugal in March when the socialist government was ousted by the center-right Democratic Alliance coalition. But the election was most notable for the rise of the radical right-wing party Chega, which\u00a0took nearly a fifth of the vote for its leader Andr\u00e9 Ventura, a former trainee priest and football pundit. Many observers expect a new election soon because of the vulnerability of the minority government. Slovakia There was good news for Putin in Slovakia in April.\u00a0Left-wing nationalist Peter Pellegrini won a presidential election in a boost to pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has sparked concerns over the rule of law and government interference in the media. The result, however, was soon overshadowed by an assassination attempt against Fico, who suffered serious injuries and suggested he was targeted because he broke with the dominant pro-Ukraine position in Europe. South Africa Voters in South Africa also demanded change as the ruling African National Congress \u2014 the party of Nelson Mandela \u2014 lost its majority for the first time in 30 years in the most significant political shift since the ending of apartheid. The rebuke followed years of corruption scandals, economic mismanagement and rising violent crime. The political horse trading following the election produced an alliance that was even more stunning than the result.\u00a0The\u00a0ANC formed an agreement to form a government with its staunchest adversary \u2014 the White-led Democratic Alliance,\u00a0which had been the official opposition to the ANC for years. Senegal Senegal has long been seen as one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies, but that legacy seemed in doubt following a decision by outgoing President Macky Sall to delay the election, which triggered mass protests. Sall was,\u00a0however,\u00a0overruled by the country\u2019s top court and the presidential election went ahead in March with opposition candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye winning a majority and becoming, at age 44, the youngest democratically elected president in Africa days after he was released from prison in an amnesty granted by Sall. Iran Iran wasn\u2019t supposed to have a presidential election this year. But the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash forced snap polls that exacerbated a succession drama surrounding the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei amid public frustration over economic conditions and clerical authoritarianism. Tehran\u2019s religious leaders kept a lid on dissent and approved a slate of mostly hardline candidates. But reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian beat ultraconservative Saeed Jalili,\u00a0amid the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Pezeshkian has favored\u00a0dialogue with Iran\u2019s foes, particularly over its nuclear program, but the US said it did not expect Iran\u2019s posture to the outside world to change since the Ayatollah wields ultimate power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/global-elections-roundup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters", "text": "It is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign. But it is rare, and no president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness. One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than President Joe Biden would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns. Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that if Biden were to drop out now \u2013 something he has so far shown no sign of doing \u2013 it would be the latest such decision in history. Johnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does. Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right. But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection. Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House. Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden still has Democratic nomination sewn up, and he would have to choose to give it up. Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate. Roosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another. Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten\u00a0strips of paper\u00a0given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election.\u00a0The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise. Three 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats. James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said: Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents. Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president. Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction. Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876. Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate. For Democrats today, holding on to at least one lever of power in Washington is a major priority as they fret over a possible second Trump term. If Biden becomes convinced that his own candidacy risks a Democratic wipeout, he might be swayed to step aside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-vacation-homes", "text": "Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Tuesday that President Joe Biden has more homes than Trump does and that Biden has homes in four expensive holiday destinations. At a campaign rally in Florida, Trump argued that Biden has spent excessive time on vacation during his presidency. \u201cAnd mansions are in \u2013 think of this \u2013 here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s been a politician all his life. He\u2019s got homes in the Virgin Islands, Nantucket, Lake Tahoe, Kiawah Island. I mean, where the hell did they get all this money, Byron?\u201d Trump said, speaking to Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. \u201cHe\u2019s got more homes than I do. What the hell is going on with him?\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. First, Biden does not have homes in any of the four places Trump claimed he does; rather, Biden has stayed at others\u2019 homes in those places. Second, Trump owns more homes than Biden does. Biden owns two houses, both in Delaware, and there is no mystery about how he afforded them. Biden\u2019s homes Biden\u2019s primary home, in a suburb of Wilmington, Delaware, is a 6,850-square-foot house Biden and his wife Jill Biden built on a lot they bought for $350,000 in 1996, 23 years into his tenure as a US senator representing Delaware. Biden\u2019s vacation home is a beach house near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, that he and Jill Biden bought for about $2.7 million in 2017. They made the purchase after they signed a lucrative three-book deal earlier that year as private citizens following his vice presidency. The Bidens disclosed the book income in tax filings they released to the public in 2019. The filings showed they had earned a total of about $15.6 million in 2017 and 2018. About $13.3 million of that was from the book deal and related paid speeches. Biden\u2019s vacations\u00a0at others\u2019 homes  As president, Biden has stayed at the homes of wealthy associates in the four vacation destinations Trump mentioned. Biden does not have his own homes in any of them. Biden has stayed at a US Virgin Islands home owned by Democratic donors Bill and Connie Neville, whom the White House has described as his friends; at a Nantucket, Massachusetts home owned by private equity titan and longtime friend David Rubenstein; at a Lake Tahoe-area Nevada home owned by prominent Democratic donor Tom Steyer; and a Kiawah Island, South Carolina home owned by campaign donor Maria Allwin. The White House said in 2023 that the Biden family was renting the Steyer home for \u201cfair market value,\u201d and Politico reported in 2021 that the Bidens were renting the Rubenstein home, but the White House has not released specifics on the financial arrangements related to their stays at the four properties; it\u2019s possible that some of the stays have been free. Regardless, Trump\u2019s assertion that they are Biden\u2019s own properties is wrong. Trump\u2019s homes\u00a0 There is no comprehensive current list of the homes Trump owns, and it can be hard to separate his personal home ownership from his business interests \u2013 for example, to decide if unsold condominiums in Trump developments should count as Trump homes. But it is clear by any reasonable measure that the billionaire real estate businessman owns more homes than Biden\u2019s two. Trump\u2019s primary residence is at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. He continues to own his former primary residence, a triplex penthouse at his Trump Tower in New York City. He also has a mansion on more than 200 acres in the suburbs of New York City, a private villa at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, and an estate on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin that his company has tried to sell for years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-vacation-homes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_kamala-harris-joe-biden-pressure", "text": "As President Joe Biden took on his critics in Washington, Vice President Kamala Harris this week made the case to their allies around the country. On Tuesday in Nevada, a battleground state crucial to their reelection bid, she blasted Project 2025 \u2013 the 900-page policy agenda drafted by conservatives with ties to former President Donald Trump. In Dallas on Wednesday, she reminded her Alpha Kappa Alpha sisters that they had been \u201con the front lines of the fight to realize the promise of America\u201d for more than a century. And in Greensboro Thursday, Harris told the crowd that 2024 is the most \u201cexistential, consequential and important election\u201d of their lifetimes. \u201cWe will continue to fight. And we will continue to organize. And in November, we will win,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe will win, because we know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d Whether Biden steps aside or \u2013 as he has insisted for nearly two weeks \u2013 remains the Democratic nominee, Harris has been under increased pressure to clearly articulate the significance of this year\u2019s election, draw distinctions between the Biden administration and Trump, and defend the ticket from Republican attacks. The vice president\u2019s efforts to reach minority voters and other key constituencies has become critical. Supporters say this is the work she has been doing \u2013 drawing on her lived experiences as a Black and South Asian woman as well as her professional background as a former district attorney, attorney general and California senator as she lays out the campaign and administration\u2019s policies such as gun safety, small business and reproductive rights. \u201cI think there\u2019s a strong team. I think you\u2019ve got Biden, but you also have a really strong vice president, and I\u2019m glad that the world is discovering her now,\u201d said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter. \u201cOftentimes, Black women are not seen until they\u2019re needed.\u201d If Biden remains the nominee, Harris\u2019s work shoring up the base could help in swing states like Pennsylvania, where she is attending the Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote presidential town hall Saturday. Dennisa Thomas, a Kansas City, Missouri, resident who attended AKA\u2019s 71st Boule in Dallas, cited Harris\u2019s support of the president as part of her own continued backing of Biden. \u201cShe is supportive of him staying on the ticket and I trust her judgment,\u201d the 31-year-old systems engineer told CNN. \u201cSo if he needs to stay, he needs to stay.\u201d If Biden does step aside, her presence on the campaign trail could help quell concerns about her ability to take on the role without gaffes or missteps. A new Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that just 30% of adults \u2013 including 42% of Democrats \u2013 want Biden to continue his campaign, compared to 67% who think he should step aside for someone else. If Biden ended his reelection bid and Harris became the nominee, 44% of all adults would be satisfied \u2013 including 37% of independents, 18% of Republicans and 77% of Democrats. Biden and the campaign have insisted that he is the strongest candidate to defeat Trump, despite polls showing a slight drop in his support post-debate. In a Biden campaign memo to staff first reported by The Associated Press, senior aides wrote there is \u201cno indication that anyone else would outperform the president vs. Trump,\u201d arguing that hypothetical match ups don\u2019t take into account future negative coverage another candidate would face. One of the first criticisms Harris would face as the nominee would be over her support of Biden. \u201cKamala Harris actually is responsible for Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous presidency because she\u2019s covered for it,\u201d Ohio Republican Sen. J.D. Vance, a possible Trump vice presidential pick, told CNN this week. This week, the Trump campaign released a digital ad accusing Harris of a misleading the public about Biden\u2019s fitness, featuring clips of Harris vouching for Biden\u2019s health and mental capabilities. Even before the president\u2019s shaky performance in last month\u2019s CNN debate, the Biden-Harris ticket trailed Trump in polls and showed signs of losing support among Black and Hispanic men and young voters compared to 2020. Now, Biden is trudging down a long, hard road to rebuild faith in their ticket after weeks of Democrats publicly and privately doubting his ability to win. As of now, the campaign has maintained the trust of many Democratic Party loyalists, particularly Black women, who have balked at the idea of shaking up the ticket, even if it meant making Harris the nominee. \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment right now where there is this distinction between Democratic voters and the elites within the party,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a Black voter engagement group. \u201cAnd so that gap needs to be closed rather quickly, because time is short and you don\u2019t want to depress your own vote.\u201d That dynamic has created an opening for Harris, who many of the president\u2019s Democratic critics have suggested could replace him on the ticket, to redirect attention to the campaign \u2013 and her role within it. \u201cAs President Biden has said, he counts on Vice President Harris\u2019 advice and counsel,\u201d Harris press secretary Ernesto Apreza said in a statement. \u201cWhether it is fighting to protect fundamental freedoms \u2014 including a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her own body \u2014 lowering the cost of prescription drugs for families, or advancing U.S. national security interests on the world stage, Vice President Harris is proud to be a governing partner to President Biden, and together they will continue to lead the nation forward.\u201d The last two weeks have shown a change in tone regarding Harris. At one point last year, the vice president was the subject of Democratic hand-wringing and concerns that she would drag down the ticket, following the waves of bad headlines throughout the first of the Biden administration. That included a botched response to an interview question about whether she planned to visit the US-Mexico border as part of her role managing the flow of migration from Central America. In other instances, allies argue, Harris received pushback because her approach to the job \u2013 such as efforts to highlight Black maternal health or her focus on the Divine Nine historic Black sororities and fraternities \u2013 didn\u2019t resemble how past vice presidents tackled the role. \u201cI don\u2019t think people quite knew what to make of her, because she was trying to do it differently,\u201d said one senior Democratic official who is close the vice president\u2019s office. \u201cShe was trying to figure out how to do the role in a way that was true to her, not just how others had done it.\u201d The shift began after the Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 decision to overturn the federal right to abortion, which helped turned the tide not just for Democrats, but for Harris specifically.\u00a0In March, Harris became the first sitting vice president to visit an abortion clinic. Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly known as NARAL, said Democrats\u2019 best bet for winning in November is with Biden, but Harris is the \u201cbest spokesperson\u201d on the issue. \u201cI want to be clear, Joe Biden is with us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she needs to be that cheerleader and that person who\u2019s really lifting up the accomplishments of the entire ticket.\u201d On Thursday, Harris traveled to North Carolina for a campaign event at Greensboro\u2019s Dudley High School, the first Black high school in Guilford County in a school system that was once segregated by law. The trip marked her sixth visit to the state this year. In her remarks, she described what the administration has done on health care, student loan debt, gun violence and working to strengthen NATO. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper pointed to Harris\u2019 visit to the state, on the heels of Biden\u2019s Raleigh rally the day after the debate and a recent trip to Wilmington by First Lady Jill Biden, as more evidence that the Biden-Harris campaign is \u201cstill alive and well in North Carolina.\u201d Cooper waved off speculation that he might be on the short list for vice presidential nominees if Biden steps aside and Harris becomes the nominee. \u201cI don\u2019t want to play into this new favorite political parlor game, because it\u2019s too important for America to stop Donald Trump,\u201d Cooper told CNN Wednesday. \u201cJoe Biden has said he is running. I support him. We have a president and a vice president who are doing a good job, and I don\u2019t expect those nominees to change.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-pressure/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_politics_us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot", "text": "US intelligence discovered earlier this year\u00a0that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer\u00a0that\u00a0has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode. The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine\u2019s war effort, these sources said.\u00a0The\u00a0plan to kill Armin Papperger,\u00a0a white-haired\u00a0goliath who\u00a0has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature. When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot.\u00a0A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US. For more than six months,\u00a0Russia has\u00a0been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe,\u00a0largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism \u2014\u00a0all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv. But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west. Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German\u00a0manufacturer of the\u00a0vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine\u2019s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine\u00a0in the coming weeks, an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow\u2019s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel. The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign \u2014\u00a0one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing sabotage, we\u2019re seeing assassination plots, we\u2019re seeing arson. We\u2019re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,\u201d a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI believe very much that we\u2019re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Adrienne Watson said in a statement, \u201cRussia\u2019s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months. \u201cThe United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have also been clear that Russia\u2019s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.\u201d German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN\u2019s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it\u00a0shows how Russia is \u201cwaging a hybrid war of aggression\u201d on European allies. \u201cWe have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,\u201d Baerbock said. In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin\u00a0\u201cwill not be intimidated by the Russian threats\ufeff,\u201d emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at \u201cundermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.\u201d A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment. \u201cThe necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,\u201d Hoffman said. CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion\u00a0among\u00a0NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country. But the campaign \u2014\u00a0and in particular Russia\u2019s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil \u2014 has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all. Russia\u2019s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a\u00a0shotgun\u00a0approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine;\u00a0Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland,\u00a0CNN has reported, a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company. Some analysts have referred to the effort as a \u201chybrid\u201d campaign,\u00a0one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia\u2019s sabotage efforts that way. \u201cI fundamentally reject the idea that what we\u2019re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of \u2018hybrid\u2019, I think of \u2026 defacing monuments,\u201d the senior NATO official said. \u201cThings that meet that traditional definition of \u2018below the threshold of armed conflict.\u2019\u201d Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations \u2014\u00a0lethal action \u2014\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that \u2018hybrid\u2019 implies,\u201d the official said. It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy. Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat\u2019s car:\u00a0US military bases across Europe were\u00a0placed on a heightened state of alert\u00a0last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed\u00a0actors were\u00a0considering carrying out\u00a0sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. In April, two German-Russian nationals\u00a0were arrested\u00a0for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And\u00a0French authorities last month\u00a0detained a Russian-Ukrainian man\u00a0who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it now because they believe that as there are a number of elections happening throughout the west, that this is a prime opportunity to try to undermine public support for Ukraine,\u201d the senior NATO official said. The official also said that Russia sees a window of opportunity before additional weapons and ammunition promised by the west arrive on the battlefield in Ukraine. For Russia, this \u201cis a prime time to target the west in these types of operations to try to undermine support and prevent the flow of weapons there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen, Nadine Schmidt and Chris Stern contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/us-germany-foiled-russian-assassination-plot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "politics"}}
