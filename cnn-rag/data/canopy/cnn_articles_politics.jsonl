The 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings observed by President Joe Biden in France Thursday will likely be the last major decennial commemoration attended by significant numbers of veterans. Even a 19-year-old who stormed ashore in the biggest amphibious operation in history would soon be 100. \ufeff\u201cWe\u2019re not far off from the time when the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us, so we have a special obligation,\u201d Biden said after embracing and saluting the last surviving members of the invasion force, above the beaches where thousands of Americans died. \u201cWe cannot let what happened here be lost in the silence of the years to come.\u201d This year\u2019s memorial ceremony represents far more than a poignant farewell to surviving comrades of more than 150,000 allied troops who forged a beachhead for the liberation of Europe from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazis. Presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from NATO nations gathered at a paradoxical moment. They are unusually united but experiencing growing dread. The alliance has a new sense of mission in opposing another war started by a tyrant bent on territorial expansion \u2014 this time in Ukraine. But at no point since June 6, 1944, has the unshakable US leadership of the West and support for internationalist values been so in question. Democracy is facing its sternest test in generations from far-right populism on the march on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Geopolitical empires like Russia and China are, meanwhile, resurgent and threatening to obliterate the global system dominated by Western values that has prevailed since World War II. Biden drew a direct line between the evil that US soldiers were called up to fight in the 1940s and the current attempt by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia to wipe Ukraine off the map and extinguish its democracy. \u201cWe cannot let that happen.\u00a0To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable. Were we to do that, it means we\u2019d be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches. Make no mistake: We will not bow down, we will not forget,\u201d he said. Those who served in Normandy, Biden said, \u201call understood our democracy is only as strong as we make it all together. They knew, beyond any doubt, there are things that are worth fighting and dying for. Freedom is worth it, democracy is worth it, America\u2019s worth it, the world is worth it \u2013 then, now and always.\u201d His words were especially resonant amid growing fears in Europe that the United States \u2013 the bulwark of democracy ever since World War II \u2013 may be about to turn its back on the West. US allies already rattled by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s constant attacks on NATO in his first term were further rocked by his recent comment that he\u2019d let Russia do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d with allies that he regarded as failing to \u201cpay their bills\u201d on defense spending. The comment weakened the foundational NATO creed of mutual self-defense without which the alliance has no meaning. Some of Trump\u2019s ex-advisers have warned that he might try to exit the alliance if he wins a second term in November. Even if Biden wins, there are growing indications that Americans\u2019 willingness to maintain the security guarantees \u2014 even to former enemies like Germany and Japan that bought 80 years of peace \u2014 may be waning. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy has taken deep root in the Republican Party that once prided itself on winning the Cold War. The ex-president tried to overturn US democracy to stay in power four years ago. And some GOP figures led by the ex-president now appear to have more empathy for Putin than liberal European democracies that the United States rebuilt after World War II. And the monthslong delay in funding Biden\u2019s most recent aid package for Ukraine raised doubts that Washington will always stand up for democracy in Europe and against aggression by autocrats. Biden on Thursday cited an unrepayable debt owed to US, British, Canadian and other troops involved in Operation Overlord. He walked among row upon row of white crosses and Stars of David shaded by pine trees and oaks overlooking Omaha Beach. This is where more than 9,000 fallen Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia lay at rest thousands of miles from the land they left to save foreigners they\u2019d never met. When the final survivors of World War II are soon gone, the world will lose living testimony of a fight against tyranny that once involved millions of people and unimaginable pain and destruction. That will usher in a dangerous period when malevolent political actors will find it easier to distort history to bolster their own power. This has already been happening as the lessons of the Nazi Holocaust, from which there are dwindling numbers of survivors to bear witness, have been challenged by a rise in antisemitism in Western societies. Is America really \u2018back\u2019? Biden took great pleasure in traveling the world after winning the 2020 election and declaring \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d He lived up to his words by wielding the most effective leadership of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush at the end of the Cold War. But many foreign leaders worry that Biden\u2019s term is an interregnum of normality rather than a return to the certainty of US leadership. With his volatile temperament, transactional suspicion of alliances and idolizing of dictators, Trump\u2019s first term turned the United States from a bulwark of stability into an unpredictable force of disruption. After a long period of denial, many in the chancelleries of Europe expect Trump to be back. Trump\u2019s mix of isolationism and populism did not emerge in a vacuum. It was distilled from years of US military failures abroad in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and a growing belief among many Americans that the globalized world was eroding the domestic dividend of prosperity and security that flowed from World War II and was built by those who returned from the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific. A growing sense that Americans are tiring of their global role has sparked overdue debates in some European capitals about doing more to ensure the continent\u2019s own security. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believes that the internal threat to the West is as great as the external one posed by US enemies. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also what\u2019s happening to the political center in France, the political center in Germany, the likely gains of the far right in the upcoming EU elections. Even if Biden were to win, Americans, Europeans are asking difficult questions about American reliability.\u201d Success was not assured The Normandy landings, long regarded as a triumph, marked the moment in history when the United States truly emerged as a superpower with the might and the will to make the world safe for democracy. But at the time, the risk of sending an armada across the English Channel in questionable weather to battle hardened Nazi forces was enormous. As allied forces landed on the beaches, President Franklin Roosevelt uttered a D-Day prayer over the radio. \u201cAlmighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.\u201d To begin with, fears of failure seemed justified. By the end of June 6, none of the invading forces had achieved their first-day objectives. More than 10,000 were dead, wounded or missing. The Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, had prepared a message before the invasion in case of a retreat. \u201cIf any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone,\u201d he wrote. But the future president never had to take his remarks out of his wallet. In the days ahead, the allies slowly established a foothold in the northwest tip of the continent. After breaking out, they were in Paris by August and, after often bitter fighting, victory in Europe was won by May 1945. For many years after World War II, D-Day commemorations lacked the fanfare and high diplomatic and political significance they carry today. And there\u2019s an argument that the geopolitical symbolism has become too heavy and threatens to obscure the simple courage of dwindling groups of veterans who make a pilgrimage to honor slain comrades. But French and American presidents especially have used the gatherings as a stage to renew transatlantic bonds. In an especially significant piece of statecraft this time, the Western leaders will be joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has billed his nation\u2019s fight for survival after the Russian invasion as an echo of the allied battle against Hitler. Russian leaders or top officials have also attended the commemorations, at least since the end of the Cold War, in honor of the Soviet Union\u2019s staggering losses fighting the Nazis. But Putin is now a pariah and has not been invited. This year\u2019s event has important domestic connotations for several leaders. It will be the first of the decennial commemorations to feature Britain\u2019s King Charles III as head of state after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, a fixture in Normandy for decades. And it offers a stage for French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden, both politically weakened, to highlight their statesmanship at a moment of global turmoil. Biden will on Friday echo one of his predecessors, Ronald Reagan, who in 1984 traveled to a clifftop 100 feet high known as Pointe du Hoc, which was scaled in a daring raid by US Army Rangers on D-Day. Despite heavy losses, the Rangers seized German artillery pieces that could have caused even greater carnage of the Omaha and Utah invasion beaches. Reagan stood in front of a stone memorial shaped into the Rangers\u2019 emblem, with his back to the Channel, surrounded by surviving veterans of the raid, and gave one of the greatest presidential speeches. \u201cThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,\u201d Reagan said. He later confessed to his diary that he was so moved it was tough to get the words out. The speech came at a particularly contentious moment in the Cold War with tensions high between Washington and the Soviet Union. But Reagan\u2019s clarion call for freedom may have had an impact. Less than a year later, Mikhail Gorbachev became secretary general of the Soviet Communist Party and set in motion reforms and nuclear arms negotiations that led to the end of the Cold War. Biden, like the 40th president, is facing concerns about his age in his reelection year. And on Friday he will visit the same clifftop to make a similar call to save democracy. Reagan\u2019s Pointe du Hoc speech is not just remarkable for its poetry. Forty years on, it\u2019s stunningly relevant to a new political era. And it\u2019s equally striking how far the Republican Party has traveled from the man who once personified it to the anti-democratic American Firstism of its current hero. \u201cWe in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs. We\u2019re bound by reality. The strength of America\u2019s allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe\u2019s democracies. We were with you then; we are with you now. Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny.\u201d In 1984, Reagan could offer that promise without fear of contradiction. Biden cannot do the same in 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-d-day-american-leadership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_democratic-convention-security-protests", "text": "Secret Service and Chicago police officials are ramping up preparations for the Democratic National Convention in August, with officers receiving training ranging from First Amendment rights to handling violent protests and mass arrests. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle visited Chicago this week to tour the United Center, where the televised prime-time convention speeches will take place, and McCormick Place, the convention center where the party will conduct business during the daytime. The convention, which takes place from August 19 to 22,\u00a0is expected to draw a crowd of 50,000 visitors \u2013 including delegates, media, vendors and more \u2013 and is also sure to be met with huge protests. Democrats are poised to nominate President Joe Biden for reelection at\u00a0their Chicago convention.\u00a0But recent\u00a0demonstrations across the country against Biden\u2019s\u00a0support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza\u00a0have raised the specter of a replay of the\u00a01968 Democratic convention, which\u00a0saw\u00a0violent clashes between\u00a0Chicago police\u00a0and\u00a0anti-Vietnam War protesters. On Monday,\u00a0Cheatle addressed the almost 100 agents of the Secret Service\u2019s Chicago field office in a closed-door meeting.\u00a0The Chicago field office also covers Milwaukee, where Republicans are holding their convention in July, so the team has been planning for both gatherings. Cheatle said in an interview that law enforcement officials are preparing for a wide range of scenarios. \u201cThe lone gunman,\u201d Cheatle said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got folks who are radicalized, you\u2019ve got demonstration that may pop up and, you know, obviously, we hope they remain peaceful here, but they could, you know, turn violent.\u201d The official security perimeter for\u00a0this summer\u2019s convention\u00a0hasn\u2019t yet been detailed. The city of Chicago, meanwhile, is negotiating over protest routes with groups that filed a federal lawsuit after the city denied their protest permits. The Chicago Police Department\u2019s\u00a0Crime Prevention and Information Center\u00a0will serve as its\u00a0command center to monitor all convention-related events\u00a0citywide, including protests.\u00a0The\u00a0command center\u00a0will also include representatives from\u00a0the Secret Service,\u00a0 the Illinois State Police,\u00a0the FBI\u00a0and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Federal and local authorities have been closely following the threat stream from both domestic and foreign extremist groups. A recent joint intelligence bulletin from the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI warned that groups, including al Qaeda and ISIS, continue to generate propaganda urging followers to conduct \u201clone wolf\u201d attacks on US soil using basic methods such as gunfire in crowded places or vehicles in ramming attacks. The bulletin cites an al Qaeda online propaganda article that highlighted the \u201cincreased division between the American people, between the right and the left, and between the Republicans and their supporters, and the Democrats and their supporters,\u201d which could increase the impact of any attack. \u201cI think everyone has a sense that the threats are real. This is not an academic exercise that we\u2019re running through. We are planning for\u00a0real-world\u00a0possibilities,\u201d said Jeff Burnside, the Secret\u00a0Service\u00a0coordinator\u00a0for the Democratic convention. Meanwhile, Chicago police officers have been holding drills on\u00a0a wide range of potential scenarios \u2014 including violent protests, extracting individuals from hostile crowds, medical emergencies and more. Bicycle teams have prepared to move quickly through the city to form barricades if necessary. Officers are also receiving constitutional and legal training on First Amendment protest rights and procedures if mass arrests are necessary. However, Chicago police\u00a0leaders say they hope the hundreds of hours of training, including tactics in de-escalation, will help to avoid clashes with protesters. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have conflicts with people if we don\u2019t have to. We don\u2019t want to clash with people if we don\u2019t have to,\u201d Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said. \u201cIf people come here to express themselves, by all means do it, but do it according to the law and do it peacefully.

Trump, who\u00a0faces the possibility of a prison sentence\u00a0after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked\u00a0in an interview aired Sunday\u00a0on Fox News about how he had \u201cfamously said\u2026\u00a0\u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president. During his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton \u201cwould have been a terrible thing.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up,\u2019 but the people would all say \u2018lock her up, lock her up.\u2019\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d is false. He called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by\u00a0using the phrase \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself. \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0after the crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina. \u201c\u2018Lock her up\u2019 is right,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania. Trump also explicitly called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment using different phrasing. \u201cHillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a June 2016 speech in California. \u201cShe has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0repeated\u00a0in an October 2016 speech in Florida.\u00a0And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Trump\u00a0softened his rhetoric\u00a0shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and didn\u2019t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to \u201clock her up.\u201d \u201cYou should lock her up, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted \u201clock them up\u201d in relation to the Biden family, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cYou should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_rfk-jr-election-president", "text": "Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is perhaps the biggest X factor remaining in the presidential race. If the current polling matches the final result, Kennedy \u2013 a onetime Democrat who tends to be better liked by Republicans \u2013 would earn the second-highest vote share of any independent or third-party White House candidate in the past half-century. But can Kennedy defy the usual gravity of politics that drags down most non-major party hopefuls as the election approaches? There are already some signs that his support may have already peaked. Now, Kennedy, at this point, is still pulling a substantial portion of the vote. He scored 14% and 17% in May polls conducted by Quinnipiac University and Marquette University Law School respectively. That\u2019s better than any third-party or independent candidate has polled in an individual survey at this stage in the cycle since Ross Perot in 1996. It\u2019s that high level of support that has caused both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to go after Kennedy. Trump is likely reading the polls that show Kennedy is slightly more likely to pull from voters who say they would be more inclined to vote for the former president. Biden is likely aware that Kennedy voters tend to skew younger \u2013 a demographic that traditionally leans Democratic. The attacks leveled on Kennedy seem like they may be having an effect. Take a look at polls conducted by Fox News, Quinnipiac and Reuters/Ipsos. All have trend lines dating back to late last year. In these three polls, Kennedy\u2019s support has dipped by an average of 5 points from their first survey to their most recent. Fox News has him going from 15% to 11%; Quinnipiac has him going from 17% to 14% (in a ballot test that includes Green Party candidate Jill Stein); Reuters/Ipsos shows him dropping from 17% to 10% among registered voters. This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t find a poll that has Kennedy doing slightly better than he was a few months ago (see Marquette). But the long-term trend line for Kennedy is not positive. Perhaps more concerning for the independent candidate is what\u2019s going on under the hood. His declining support isn\u2019t just a matter of voters now believing that backing anyone who isn\u2019t a Democrat or Republican would be a wasted vote. This is a matter of Kennedy himself becoming less liked. Take two polls that asked about Kennedy after he declared his independent candidacy in 2023 and then last month. His unfavorable rating in May\u2019s Quinnipiac poll jumped to 43% among voters, his highest on record. Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating dropped to 25%, just one point above his all-time low in the Quinnipiac poll. His net favorability was minus-18 points. He\u2019d previously never had a net negative favorable rating in the double digits. Kennedy, for almost the entire campaign, had considerably higher net favorability than either Biden or Trump. This was reversed in the latest Quinnipiac poll. Marquette\u2019s polling showed a somewhat similar trend. In November, Kennedy had a 38% favorable and 38% unfavorable rating. Today, he\u2019s at a 31% favorable and 45% unfavorable rating \u2013 his worst to date. (Marquette found Kennedy with a net favorable rating of +8 points during the primary season in February, when his unfavorable rating dipped to 32%.) Both Marquette and Quinnipiac continue to show that Kennedy is better liked by Republicans than Democrats. But even there, Kennedy has seen a clear decline in popularity. From April to May, Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating went from 44% among Republican voters to 31% in Quinnipiac\u2019s polling. His unfavorable rating climbed from 20% to 30%. The dip in Kennedy\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t the biggest surprise. The last time Trump faced off against an unpopular Democrat (Hillary Clinton in 2016), Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson looked like he could become the first independent or third-party candidate since Perot to take at least 5% of the presidential popular vote. Johnson ended up fading down the stretch, getting a little bit more than 3%. That was still the highest percentage for a non-major presidential candidate since Perot in 1996. This year, Kennedy is consistently polling higher than Johnson was in 2016. But Johnson had access to the Libertarian ballot line and was on the ballot in all 50 states. Kennedy, however, is currently nowhere near securing official ballot access in all 50 states. So all these national polls that indicate high levels of support for Kennedy aren\u2019t telling the full story if he won\u2019t be an option on many voters\u2019 ballots. Of course, this election isn\u2019t going to be won through the national popular vote. It will be won state-by-state through the Electoral College. How many ballots Kennedy gets on in the six closest states that Biden won in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) will ultimately be what determines his role in this election. Getting on the ballot isn\u2019t always easy for an independent, as Kennedy has learned in his ballot battle with Nevada. Still, this election is expected to be a close one, especially in the northern battleground states. Any share of the vote that Kennedy takes away from Biden or Trump could end up being crucial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/rfk-jr-election-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_joe-biden-emmanuel-macron-state-visit", "text": "President Joe Biden heralded the close ties between the United States and France on Saturday, calling his current visit \u201cthe most remarkable trip\u201d that he\u2019s made to the country as French President Emmanuel Macron hosted his US counterpart for an official state visit in Paris. \u201cThis week, we have once again showed the world \u2026 the power of allies, what we can achieve when we stand together. That\u2019s what the relationship between France and the United States exemplifies,\u201d Biden said in remarks with Macron from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. The visit comes as the US has strengthened its alliance with its oldest ally amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, even as some signs of fissures have emerged over the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East. \u201cWhen we stand as one, our countries are stronger and literally, the world is safer,\u201d Biden said during a state dinner later Saturday. \u201cWe stand at an inflection point in history. The decisions we make now will determine the course of our future for decades to come.\u201d The state visit began with Macron and French first lady Brigitte Macron welcoming Biden and first lady Jill Biden with a formal ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, a Paris landmark. The leaders paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and placed the end of a large sword into the eternal flame. A French military choir performed \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d followed by \u201cLa\u00a0Marseillaise.\u201d\u00a0Biden and Macron observed a flyover before greeting officials from a French delegation as bagpipes played \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d The Bidens and Macrons signed a guestbook before boarding their respective vehicles, which drove slowly down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, flanked by military personnel and American and French flags. The normally bustling Parisian thoroughfare was emptied of pedestrians, with significant road closures affecting the area. Biden described Saturday\u2019s arrival ceremony as a \u201cmoving experience.\u201d \u201cIt was a moving experience for a student of history to be at the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e today \u2013 that was a moving experience for us, the whole delegation,\u201d he said. Upon arriving at the \u00c9lsy\u00e9e Palace, the French president\u2019s official residence, the leaders posed for photos before beginning a working lunch. In the evening, the Macrons welcomed the Bidens back to the palace for a state dinner. Macron is returning the favor to Biden, who hosted the French president for a state visit at the White House in December 2022, the administration\u2019s first. Biden noted that the US celebrates Independence Day, the Fourth of July, next month. \u201cThat feat would not have been possible \u2026 were it not for France coming to our aid. We\u2019re a nation because of France, in large part. You stepped up when we needed help,\u201d he said. France, Biden said, \u201cwas our first friend. Remains one of our best friends.\u201d \u201cToday, I proudly stand with France and support freedom and democracy around the world. That\u2019s what this spectacular week is all about,\u201d he said. There has been much for the leaders to discuss. Macron, like other US allies, has privately questioned the future of US leadership in the world should Biden lose the November election to former President Donald Trump, with whom he had a more complicated relationship. Biden has frequently recalled meeting with world leaders early in his term during a G7 gathering where he pronounced, \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d \u201cAnd the French leader looked at me, and he said, \u2018For how long?\u2019\u201d Biden said to laughter at a March fundraiser in New York City. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t humorous. He said \u2013 he was serious, \u2018For how long?\u2019\u201d Biden has often pointed to those anxieties among his counterparts as he makes the case for a second term, though Europe has also had to contend with its own rising tide of populism. On the topic of Ukraine, both countries have touted their support for the war-torn country. Biden on Friday announced a new $225 billion aid package while apologizing to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the congressional delay. And for his part, Macron has been one of the key leaders in Europe\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. France has doubled its defense budget, announced it would surpass NATO\u2019s 2% defense spending benchmark and restarted domestic production of critical military inputs. Biden pointed to both countries\u2019 support for Ukraine as an example of their close relationship. \u201cWe know what happens if (Russian President Vladimir) Putin succeeds in subjugating Ukraine. \u2026 And we know Putin isn\u2019t going to stop at Ukraine \u2013 it\u2019s not just Ukraine, it\u2019s about much more than Ukraine. All of Europe will be threatened. We\u2019re not gonna let that happen,\u201d Biden said. On the Israel-Hamas war, Macron endorsed a ceasefire proposal laid out by Biden, writing in a post on X last week, \u201cThe war in Gaza must end. We support the US proposal for a durable peace.\u201d But France broke with Western allies last month as its Foreign Ministry expressed support for the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Biden had called the ICC\u2019s decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d Both Macron and Biden on Saturday welcomed the news of the rescue of four Israeli hostages who were taken captive by Hamas on October 7, with Biden using the moment to press for the ceasefire proposal he detailed last week. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop working until all the hostages are home and a ceasefire is reached,\u201d the president said. The US-French relationship has dramatically improved from a low point early in the Biden administration. In September 2021, Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multibillion-dollar defense contract.\u00a0 \u201cThey have a warm and close relationship,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Friday evening. \u201cOne of the things the president respects and admires about President Macron is he\u2019s as honest and forthright as President Joe Biden is. That\u2019s what he wants to see in a friend, in an ally.\u201d Biden and Macron were also set to discuss deepening maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, with an announcement expected to build law enforcement capacity and increase US-France technical cooperation on port security, Kirby said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see that we are as close as we have ever been with our French allies,\u201d Kirby added.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_biden-israel-hostage-rescue-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s power to engineer a swift abatement of the war between Israel and Hamas just suffered two serious new blows. Fallout from an Israeli special forces rescue mission in Gaza, which retrieved four hostages but killed scores of Palestinian civilians, and the resignation of centrist Benny Gantz from Israel\u2019s war cabinet on Sunday sharpened political and diplomatic dilemmas Biden has struggled for months to reconcile. \u2022 The return of four hostages was a moment of joy for their families, and for all Israelis, and was welcomed by the United States. But the humanitarian toll of the operation underscores the carnage Israel has inflicted on civilians often used by Hamas as human shields in the war, which erupted with the radical Islamic group\u2019s assault on Israel on October 7. \u2022 The latest bloodshed in Gaza could further estrange Biden from progressives in his electoral coalition who are outraged at his support for Israel, its operations and its failure to do more to shield civilians. Any significant drop-off in votes from this constituency could endanger Biden in swing states where his rematch against Donald Trump could be decided by thousands of votes. The issue is especially fraught in Michigan, a potentially decisive state in November, which is home to significant numbers of Arab Americans. Vice President Kamala Harris was confronted by a protester during an appearance in the key swing state on Saturday night as she welcomed the hostage release while mourning civilians who were killed. \u2022 The rescue mission also emphasizes the disparity in the death toll between Palestinians and Israelis in the conflict. This is likely to further isolate Israel internationally from nations horrified by the Hamas attacks and to inject further tension between Washington and its allies over the war. Around 1,200 Israelis were killed in the Hamas attacks, while thousands of Palestinians have died in Gaza. \u2022 Gaza\u2019s bloodiest day in six months, according to authorities there, could also further narrow the political room available to key Arab states involved in the intense US diplomatic efforts to end the fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is nevertheless headed back to Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Qatar this week to try to hike pressure on Hamas to agree a deal. New turmoil in Israeli politics The resignation of Gantz, a retired army general who said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has no plans for ultimate victory in Gaza or what happens afterward, will have significant domestic and international consequences but is unlikely to transform Israeli politics. \u2022 Gantz\u2019s party is not a member of the prime minister\u2019s governing coalition, so his departure is unlikely to immediately bring Netanyahu down. If Netanyahu were eventually brought down, it would likely please the Biden administration because of tensions with the prime minister, his refusal to accept US calls to do more to shield Palestinian civilians and his willingness to side with Republicans using the conflict to damage Biden. \u2022 But the loss of Gantz could make Netanyahu more reliant on hard-right members of his coalition who have been pushing him for an even more intense prosecution of the war. That could raise the risks of escalation, which could intensify the simmering wider regional war in which the US is involved. \u2022 The absence of Gantz may also create an even greater obstacle to approval of any peace deal between Israel and Hamas. Besides Netanyahu, the only remaining member of the emergency government with decision-making power is Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, also from the prime minister\u2019s Likud party. \u2022 The fracturing of the Israeli war cabinet and Gantz\u2019s call for elections could have unpredictable consequences in Israel amid rising protests against Netanyahu. Thousands of people showed up this weekend in marches in multiple cities calling for the release of the remaining hostages and the chance to vote. Biden\u2019s Middle East problem never seems to get better The latest twist in the Gaza conflict came with Biden in France on a trip marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, which he used to warn of growing threats to global democracy and to toughen his political attacks on Trump and the ex-president\u2019s increasingly obvious authoritarian tendencies. National security adviser Jake Sullivan encapsulated the administration\u2019s complex political and diplomatic conundrum in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Speaking against a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower on Sunday, he told Dana Bash the US \u201cdid not participate militarily\u201d in the operation to rescue the four Israeli hostages after a US official earlier said that an American \u201ccell\u201d in Israel took part in efforts to free hostages. Sullivan said US assets had been supporting Israel in helping to identify the locations of those held following the October 7 attacks. Sullivan also reinforced US calls for a ceasefire, despite doubts that Hamas will agree to one and a belief among some Democrats in Washington that Netanyahu may seek to prolong the war to bolster his hopes of political survival. Washington has been tireless in the search for a halt to the fighting. But its failure to create a breakthrough raises questions about US leverage and Biden\u2019s prestige on the world stage five months from Election Day. \u201cThe best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians is to end this war. And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal President Biden announced and that Israel has accepted,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cInnocent people were tragically killed in this operation,\u201d Sullivan added. \u201cThe exact number we don\u2019t know, but innocent people were killed. And that is heartbreaking. That is tragic.\u201d But the national security adviser\u2019s comments will do nothing to ease Biden\u2019s domestic political exposure over the war. The administration is caught between his left flank and Republicans who have strong political incentives to damage Biden and to deepen ties with their far-right ideological partner Netanyahu. The president\u2019s impossible straddle is likely to become even more testing when Netanyahu takes up on July 24 an invitation to address Congress, which was signed by all four congressional leaders but initiated by Republicans including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Biden has been incessantly heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters at campaign events since the war erupted, and any large demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August could create poor optics and play into Trump\u2019s narrative that a law enforcement crackdown is needed in out-of-control cities. Sen. Tom Cotton voiced the GOP\u2019s hardline on the conflict when he said Sunday on Fox News that he\u2019d spoken to Netanyahu to congratulate him on the raid. The Arkansas Republican also chided \u201cthe progressive left here in America, to include The New York Times and Washington Post\u201d for highlighting the loss of large numbers of innocent civilians killed during the Israeli operation. While casting doubt on the casualty figures, Cotton said on Fox News, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want your people killed in hostage rescue missions, then you shouldn\u2019t take hostages in the first place.\u201d Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said at least 274 people were killed and hundreds were wounded during the IDF\u2019s operation to free four Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the health ministry\u2019s figures. Israel\u2019s political crisis deepens in a way that will test Biden Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, said he was pulling out of Netanyahu\u2019s government because the prime minister put personal political considerations ahead of post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, and he called on the prime minister to hold an election. \u201cDo not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. Netanyahu had called on Gantz to stay. But his departure doesn\u2019t immediately imperil the governing coalition, which still has 64 seats in the 120-member Knesset. The hostage rescue raid and new turbulence in Israeli politics follow Biden\u2019s latest bid to end the war last month when he publicly laid out a three-phase peace plan that would begin with an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages and more humanitarian relief in Gaza. His call was endorsed by G7 leaders and was seen by some analysts as an attempt to box in Netanyahu since the deal originally came from the Israelis. In response, Netanyahu insisted the war would not end until Hamas was defeated. Hamas responded positively. Netanyahu\u2019s legendary staying power and the reality of the political calendar means there\u2019s a strong chance Biden will be forced to deal with the prime minister for the rest of his reelection campaign amid a conflict that could end both their political careers. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East peace negotiator for multiple US presidents, said Sunday on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d that the Israeli prime minister would try to run out the US political clock since the Knesset goes into recess on July 25 and doesn\u2019t return until shortly before the US election. \u201cI think he is going to try to buy time before then and make a judgment on how he wants to comport himself with respect to the next US president,\u201d Miller said. \u201cHe can\u2019t vote in our election, but if he could, I suspect if he wouldn\u2019t be voting for Joe Biden.\u201d Biden has argued that Israel has degraded Hamas to such an extent that it should now begin to contemplate the security end game for Gaza. Some US experts believe it will be impossible to fully eradicate Hamas. But the group seems unlikely to embrace a permanent peace deal that would lead to it losing power in Gaza \u2014 one reason why the situation is so intractable. \u201cIn order to beat Hamas politically, you\u2019ve got to introduce another element here. The Saudis, the [United Arab Emirates], and the other Arab governments are willing to do it. You\u2019re going to need some role for the Palestinian Authority,\u201d Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday. \u201cPresident Biden made it clear that the United States will be a partner, but it needs Israel to pivot to that place. But it\u2019s unwilling to, so I think what we\u2019ll likely to see is the war in Gaza continue for some time, albeit at a lower level,\u201d Haass added. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at probably a long, slow grind in Gaza.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/biden-israel-hostage-rescue-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_sport_cricket-united-states-changing-world", "text": "Call it the Miracle on Grass. A national cricket team that most Americans didn\u2019t even know they had beat one of the sport\u2019s global powers Pakistan, for whom the game is a national obsession. The triumph Thursday in the T20 World Cup \u2013 a global tournament using a shortened, three-hour version of a game that can last five days and still end in a draw \u2013 shocked the cricketing world. Cricket briefly flickered into US consciousness as the result popped up on news sites in a rare moment for a sport that lives in obscurity in the United States outside the South Asian and Caribbean communities. \u201cBeating Pakistan in the World Cup is going to open many doors for us,\u201d said USA Cricket captain Monank Patel in Texas, where the game took place in a converted minor league baseball park. Corey Anderson, who represented New Zealand internationally and now plays for the US team, told CNN he got hundreds of text messages after the win. \u201cIt\u2019s probably shocked the cricketing world,\u201d said the 33-year-old who has an American wife and kids. \u201cI know definitely here in the US it\u2019s been a lot of media coverage, which is fantastic. I think USA Cricket is just not that well known within America, and I think we put ourselves a little bit more on the map.\u201d Cricket faces huge barriers to becoming anything more than a curiosity to most Americans. But the US victory over Pakistan is exactly what global cricket chiefs hoped for when bringing some of this year\u2019s T20 World Cup to the United States, which is co-hosting along with islands in the Caribbean, a more traditional hotbed of the game that has faced challenges from the encroachment of US sports. In the biggest game ever on US soil, more than 30,000 fans will Sunday pack into towering bleachers in a temporary stadium that materialized out of nowhere in a Long Island, New York, park to watch India play Pakistan. Tickets are selling for $700 on the secondary market. The global TV audience could at least double the 124 million who tuned into the Super Bowl this year. Peter Della Penna, an American journalist and broadcaster who covers cricket in this country after falling for the game during a college exchange stint in Australia, was stunned when he saw the new infrastructure on Long Island. \u201cThey had a recreational cricket field, but it was basically just a community park,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see what was there when I got there was quite extraordinary. Talking to the residents and the community, they are taken aback.\u201d America\u2019s most famous cricket victory on Thursday tells a story about the changing demographic mix in the United States. Cricket\u2019s new Field of Dreams in Nassau County is testimony to a dynamic and highly educated South Asian community that is becoming increasingly prosperous and connected in US business and society and politically more important. It\u2019s no coincidence that former President Donald Trump appeared alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before around 100,000 people at a rally at the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad in 2020. He wanted to woo a slice of the electorate back home. \u201cThe diaspora is sizable, and they clearly have connections to\u00a0(India) \u2026 the most populous nation in the world,\u201d said Simon Chadwick, a professor specializing in the geopolitical economy of sport at SKEMA, a global business school. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a large diaspora, a large country. You\u2019ve got a sport that has proved to be commercially incredibly successful. You got have investors, not just from the United States or from the Gulf region, hungry for potential commercial opportunities and willing to take a punt.\u201d How cricket mirrors a revolution in global sports The T20 World Cup games in the United States also reflect one of the most dynamic new realities in the multi-billion-dollar market of global sports. This is the shift in power away from traditional sports administrators and marketplaces like the United Kingdom and Europe to rising countries in the Middle East and South Asia. Cricket was spread around the globe by colonialists at a time when the sun never used to set on the British Empire. It\u2019s still most popular in nations the British used to rule, like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, \ufeffNew Zealand and Australia. Its premier international contest is the Ashes, a series of five-day contests that span the summer between England and Australia that date back to 1877 and take place twice every four years, once in each nation. But the balance of power in cricket has now shifted to India because of its massive television market and the emerging middle class in a nation with a billion people. The Indian Premier League, an annual short-form tournament that draws the world\u2019s top players with huge salaries, is transforming the game in a way that alienates many traditionalists and has spawned a series of spin-off franchise leagues \u2014 including the fledging Major League Cricket in the US that debuted last year with games in Texas and North Carolina. Indian cricketers, especially the batting legend Virat Kohli, are megastars back home and the strong viewership of the IPL among US fans built a rationale to bring World Cup games to America. The transformation of cricket parallels the growing power of soccer\u2019s new elites like the United Arab Emirates, which is the majority owner of Manchester City, and Qatar, which bankrolls Paris Saint-Germain. Middle Eastern money has flowed into Formula One, which \u2013 like cricket \u2013 is expanding in the US. Saudi Arabia is behind a split in professional golf after buying up top players with its LIV golf league. Cricket will become an Olympic sport in Los Angeles in 2028 partly because Modi, a just reelected Hindu nationalist, leveraged India\u2019s growing international clout to get it included. The internationalization of sports finance is not universally welcome. Some critics dismiss investments by Middle Eastern nations and events like the FIFA World Cup in Qatar or the Beijing Olympics as \u201csports washing\u201d \u2014 a way for authoritarian nations to clean up their images abroad. But it also reflects how developing nations are changing world\u2019s balance of economic and political power and, in some cases, are eclipsing their former colonial rulers. \u201cThere is this pivot from global north to global south,\u201d said Chadwick. \u201cAnd this pivot is evident not just in cricket or sports, but obviously in economic and political affairs, generally.\u201d What is cricket? Cricket is a game of bat-and-ball with distant similarities to baseball. Batters stand before a wicket \u2013 three vertical wooden poles stuck in the ground at either end of a strip of tightly mown grass called a pitch \u2013 that is a bit like a strike zone. Bowlers, who can reach speeds of 90 mph or more \u2013 and slower specialists called spinners who exert revolutions on the hard cricket ball with a flick of the wrist or a snap of the fingers \u2013 deliver the ball with a straight arm hurl. The ball must bounce on the pitch before it reaches the batter, allowing skilled bowlers to create deviations off a surface that becomes more receptive as it gets scuffed up. Runs are scored by batters running between the wickets. If a ball is hit out of the playing area with the flat faced wooden bat along the ground, the batting team gets four runs. If it goes into the stands on the fly, it\u2019s six runs \u2013 the equivalent of a home run. The bowling side records outs either by hitting the stumps with the ball or by rapping the batter on the leg pad in front of them in a dismissal known as leg before wicket or LBW. The bowling team can also get outs \u2013 also confusingly known as wickets \u2013 when close catchers or outfielders catch the ball before it bounces or by using it to knock down the stumps if a batter is running between them. Each team has 10 outs in an inning and the winning side is the one that gets the most runs. The match is divided into units called overs \u2013 groups of six balls delivered by one bowler. The T20 format is played over 20 overs. There\u2019s a day-long version of the game over 50 overs. The most exalted form of cricket is the Test Match. These games are limited by time and not overs and play out like a long Shakespearean drama in five six-hour days in a row and include two innings per team. Test matches have waned in popularity in some countries as life speeds up and attention spans wane. But they are still popular in places like England and Australia. In the 1932-33 season Down Under, the two nations came close to breaking off diplomatic relations because of a dispute over \u201cBodyline\u201d tactics pioneered by the England team \u2013 the bowling of fast short-pitched deliveries at a batter\u2019s head designed to thwart Australian phenom Donald Bradman, the Michael Jordan of his day. The first ever international cricket match was in the US but can the game catch on here? Cricket has a long history in this country. The first ever international fixture was between the United States and Canada in 1844 in New York. But baseball soon superseded cricket in the US. The game however is becoming increasingly visible. There are hundreds of club teams, and it is no longer unusual to see games in public parks in big US cities with teams mostly drawn from Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi communities. Elite US cricket is dominated by players of South Asian or Caribbean descent. The bowler in the super over \u2013 overtime play after the match against Pakistan \u2013 was Saurabh Netravalkar, a left-arm fast bowler who played Under-19s for India and now works in the tech industry in California. Milind Kumar, the outfielder who pulled off a spectacular catch (cricketers use their bare hands not mitts) was born in New Delhi. The question now is whether the USA\u2019s stunning win will trigger a rush of interest from outside the South Asian diaspora. The obstacles are huge. Most Americans couldn\u2019t watch Thursday\u2019s game even if they\u2019d have known it was on. The World Cup is being carried in the US on Willow TV, a streaming service that is also available on cable systems for an extra fee. It\u2019s tough for foreign sports to break into the idiosyncratic US market as established sports are bedded in popular culture, local communities and the rhythm of the seasons. The global game, soccer, has several times hubristically tried to conquer the US and it\u2019s taken years to reach its current level with strong pro leagues the MLS and the NWSL. But NBC\u2019s coverage of England\u2019s Premier League has broadened the game\u2019s appeal. It\u2019s not unusual now to see a Manchester United or Arsenal game on TV at college football tailgates in the Deep South on Saturday mornings. But considering almost every American kid plays soccer, the game ought to be bigger than it is. The wildly successful US Women\u2019s National Team might be a model for USA Cricket as it seeks to get girls involved. The best thing that could happen for America\u2019s cricketers would be a prolonged run at the 2028 Olympics that could catch the public\u2019s attention on national TV. The Olympics, and the national pride that comes with winning medals could also help cricket expand far beyond its current geographic footprint. \u201cInevitably, you have countries like the United States, China, and others that as far as possible, try to enter teams or athletes into medal winning sports,\u201d said Chadwick, who was speaking from Belgium. \u201cI think this transition from being a colonial pastime to being a medal winning Olympic sport is a game changer. It\u2019s a predictor of a likely increasing engagement with cricket around the world.\u201d But the game\u2019s growth in the US will be hampered by the lack of school or community cricket for kids and no path to the currently impossible dream of the sport being played in colleges. And the women\u2019s game is starting from a tiny base. Only about 400 of the 200,000 registered players in the US are female. \u201cYou can look at this event in two ways, depending on how you define success,\u201d said Della Penna, mentioning good World Cup ticket sales to South Asian expatriates and fans originating from Commonwealth nations. But there are high cultural and economic barriers to entry for other Americans to a sport that requires expensive equipment and coaching. \u201cIf you\u2019re defining success by a measure of what kind of legacy will be left behind after the circus leaves town, you\u2019re not going to find much success because you\u2019re not seeing kids play,\u201d Della Penna said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/sport/cricket-united-states-changing-world/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_coast-guard-official-resigns-alleges-coverup-invs", "text": "A US Coast Guard Academy official says top leaders directed her to lie to sexual assault victims and Congress, making her an unwitting accomplice in a cover-up of decades of abuse. As a result, Shannon Norenberg says she\u2019s resigning from her role as the academy\u2019s head of sexual assault prevention and issuing a public apology to survivors, saying she is no longer willing to stay silent. \u201cThe Coast Guard lied to me,\u201d she wrote in a public statement posted online Sunday. \u201cI can no longer in good conscience be part of an organization that would betray me, betray victims of sexual assault, and betray the system I helped set up to hold perpetrators at the academy accountable.\u201d Norenberg\u2019s explosive allegations were made in advance of a congressional hearing this week at which the Coast Guard\u2019s first female commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, is slated to testify about the agency\u2019s sexual misconduct scandal. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Norenberg said she had made it her mission to help sexual assault survivors at the Coast Guard Academy for more than a decade. She said she was devastated when she recently discovered old records showing how leaders had used her as part of the cover-up of Operation Fouled Anchor, a secret internal probe into\u00a0a history of sexual assault cover-ups that CNN exposed last summer. She wrote in her public posting that she was sent on an \u201capology tour\u201d in 2019 to brief dozens of assault victims about their cases, which had previously been mishandled by academy leadership. The list of talking points she was given at the time shows she was directed to tell victims that Congress was already fully aware of the operation, which she now knows was not the case. She believes this was intended to \u201cdissuade the victims from contacting their Members of Congress.\u201d The Coast Guard said it was a mistake \u2013 not a conspiracy \u2013 for the talking point about Congress to be on the list given to Norenberg. The agency added that Coast Guard officials recently interviewed a now-retired Coast Guard officer present during those victim meetings, and she said the talking point was never brought up. Norenberg said she didn\u2019t have a precise recollection of all the meetings, but noted she had one-on-one calls with several victims outside the presence of the now-retired officer. Norenberg also said that if she had been told that Congress was unaware, she would have notified lawmakers immediately. \u201cWhy would anyone trust anything the Coast Guard has to say about Operation Fouled Anchor at this point?\u201d she said. Norenberg was also instructed to not include the historic assaults being investigated in data that Congress would see, she said, and was prohibited from offering survivors key paperwork that would have helped them access mental health services and veteran\u2019s benefits available to sexual assault victims. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sent out there to help these people, I realized,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe whole thing was a cruel cover-up at the expense of the victims, with the entire purpose being to preserve the image of the Coast Guard and avoid scandal. And the Coast Guard used me as part of their plan.\u201d For nearly a year, Fagan has been coming under increasing pressure as she continues to grapple with the fallout from Operation Fouled Anchor. She has repeatedly said she wants to learn from the past and move forward, but a new string of controversies has shown that sexual misconduct remains pervasive across the Coast Guard and is a far bigger issue than she has publicly acknowledged. Among the developments: Adding to the pressure on Fagan, congressional lawmakers have expressed growing frustration with the Coast Guard\u2019s handling of the controversy. When Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s office discovered non-disclosure agreements that had been given to sexual assault victims as part of Fouled Anchor to prevent them from speaking out about their alleged attacks, he slammed the practice in a letter to Fagan. Soon after, the agency issued a directive to no longer execute these agreements for victims. Senators have accused Fagan of evading congressional oversight\u00a0during multiple ongoing government investigations and questioned why current or former leaders have not been held accountable for covering up misconduct. Most recently, they demanded that she appear at a Senate hearing on Tuesday, saying the Coast Guard\u2019s lack of cooperation with the ongoing congressional probe can \u201conly be explained by either its indifference or another shameful attempt to cover-up the embarrassing truths of its mishandling of cases involving sexual assault and sexual harassment.\u201d Norenberg\u2019s allegations have already been raised with senators and are expected to be part of the discussion at the hearing, her attorney told CNN. \u2018Maybe this is the moment\u2019 Victims echoed Norenberg\u2019s concerns, saying they felt their lives were turned upside down when they were asked to recount the trauma they endured as part of the Fouled Anchor investigation, only to be forgotten once again. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care about the impact on us or why we wanted to share this information,\u201d said one former Coast Guard Acadamy cadet who was visited by a Coast Guard criminal investigator in 2018.\u00a0 She originally reported being raped by a classmate in 2005, but no criminal charges were filed despite the alleged rapist being found by academy officials to have had \u201cnon-consensual\u201d sexual intercourse with her. After giving her 2018 interview as part of Fouled Anchor, she said she never heard from the Coast Guard again about her case. Even Norenberg didn\u2019t know the full scope of the Fouled Anchor scandal until CNN\u2019s reporting, which found that the operation had been quietly closed and hidden from Congress by agency leaders despite substantiating dozens of sexual assaults that had previously been mishandled at the academy. As a result, some of the accused had ascended to top roles at the Coast Guard and other military agencies, while some victims had left the academy after reporting their assaults and had spent decades coping with severe negative effects to their careers and mental and physical health. Norenberg said she began questioning her involvement with Fouled Anchor after CNN\u2019s reports and found in her files the five-page list of talking points that, she said, confirmed that what she had been part of was actually an organized effort to protect the Coast Guard\u2019s reputation \u2013 not an attempt to help victims rebuild their lives. After finding the document, she knew she had to resign. Norenberg told CNN she is frustrated that many of the issues exposed by Fouled Anchor, such as perpetrators going unpunished and victims facing retaliation for coming forward, still exist today despite messaging from Commandant Fagan claiming otherwise. She had hoped that through her job leading the Coast Guard Academy\u2019s sexual assault prevention efforts and working with victims, she could improve the culture. She says she helped victims file official reports to ensure their allegations were investigated and worked to improve access to victim\u2019s advocates, but that a lack of appropriate consequences for many perpetrators remained troubling to her. Criminal prosecutions were rare, she said, with only three cases going to court-martial trials in her 11 years at the academy. And she said she repeatedly raised concerns to academy officials that accused sexual offenders who were kicked out of the academy were then allowed to enlist. Norenberg said she notified officials of her intent to resign in late May. As she weighed her next steps, she reached out to an attorney named Ryan Melogy. She had learned of Melogy after he represented a US Merchant Marine Academy cadet whose rape allegations prompted a reckoning in the commercial shipping industry several years ago. When Norenberg told Melogy she was considering going public with her concerns, he asked her if she had seen the recent uprising on social media. She had not. But later, after reviewing the litany of posts, where many current and former members said managers had looked the other way when they reported misconduct, she became even more emboldened.\u00a0 A military sexual assault survivor herself, she said her own memories of being raped by a boot camp leader when she was 18 years old had driven her into this line of work and now compelled her to come forward. She said seeing that so many others were speaking up about how they felt betrayed by the Coast Guard gave her hope that it would now be impossible for the Coast Guard to ignore them. She is planning to start a YouTube channel where she will interview survivors \u2014 giving them a platform to speak out about their sexual assaults. \u201cMaybe this is the moment in time we can get people to listen to us,\u201d she said. What should we investigate next?

{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters", "text": "Theodore Roosevelt carefully crafted his image of rugged manliness. The wealthy heir became a Badlands cowboy and a volunteer Rough Rider and war hero. A populist and a reformer as president, Roosevelt enjoyed incredible popularity during his lifetime \u2013 and he nearly remade the American political system when, frustrated by the direction of the Republican Party after his presidency, he splintered off as a third-party candidate and nearly won election as a Progressive \u201cBull Moose\u201d in 1912. But that image is not complete, according to \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President,\u201d a new biography by Edward O\u2019Keefe, CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, which is constructing a new Roosevelt library in the Badlands of North Dakota. O\u2019Keefe is also a former colleague at CNN. The book argues that the women in Roosevelt\u2019s life do not get the historical attention they deserve, something O\u2019Keefe proves with detailed research and engaging writing. I talked to O\u2019Keefe about the book and how Roosevelt and his definition of masculinity relate to today. Our conversation by phone, edited for length, is below: Notoriously masculine, but the product of unsung women WOLF: Your book is about the women behind the most notoriously masculine president. What were you trying to do here?  O\u2019KEEFE: \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d argues that the most masculine president in the American memory is actually the product of unsung and extraordinary women. Theodore Roosevelt is chiseled in marble on Mount Rushmore, and the myth is that everything he did in his incredibly successful personal and political life was the product of his own will. That is true, but it also isn\u2019t the full story. His two sisters, Bamie (Anna) and Conie (Corinne); his two wives, Alice and Edith; and his mother Mittie (Martha) were an integral part of his success, and their stories have been almost entirely lost to history. Frequently absent at times of emotional difficulty WOLF: That theme shines through \u2014 that these women propped up this most famous of American men. But much of his life is built around leaving them. He was not there when his first wife gave birth. He left his second wife, who was critically ill, to go off with the Rough Riders. He\u2019s on safari. He\u2019s in the Badlands. He\u2019s very absent. How do you reconcile that fact with the larger theme of the book? O\u2019KEEFE: I\u2019m so glad you noticed that. I had this fascinating conversation with Connie Roosevelt, who is the wife of Theodore Roosevelt IV (Teddy\u2019s great-grandson). The first time I met her in 2019, we were at a fundraiser for the National Parks Conservation Association, and I had just started to work on the research for what would become \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d And I said to Connie almost exactly as you\u2019re saying, that there is this pattern that Theodore Roosevelt is absent. He leaves in a lot of emotionally difficult circumstances. And she chuckled and said, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough go hunting,\u201d which is a line that I do use in the book. Theodore Roosevelt, who is known for willing himself through physical pain \u2014 that resilience of a cowboy and a rancher would really wilt when it came to emotionally difficult circumstances. He basically abandoned his daughter for the better part of three years, offered to give his daughter to his sister and have Bamie, his elder sister, raise her. He later said of his exploits in Cuba that he would have left his wife\u2019s deathbed to be there, and that\u2019s not an exaggerated statement. I think that the women in his life understood that they needed to be the support system, especially emotionally, that he didn\u2019t always have the capacity to have. I think if there\u2019s one surprising thing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,\u201d in addition to the argument that TR is actually the product of women, it\u2019s that he\u2019s an incredibly emotional person, as much as he\u2019s caricatured in history. I love Robin Williams and the depiction in \u201cNight at the Museum,\u201d but that\u2019s a cartoon of Theodore Roosevelt. It\u2019s easy to caricature him with the big smile and teeth and the hat and the cowboy, but he\u2019s a very sensitive, emotional person who feels very deeply. I think it\u2019s what allowed him to empathize with people. It\u2019s what allowed him to connect with people. That\u2019s all, by the way, a direct result of the influence of his mother, Mittie, who\u2019s been completely written off in history. How a wealthy person became a populist leader WOLF: The gender inequality of the day is a major takeaway from this book. But also the general inequality. Roosevelt was born into fabulous wealth. These are people that take monthslong trips to Europe when he\u2019s a child. He is never not wealthy. But then he escapes that perception to become this populist leader. When inequality is such a big issue today, how do you view his rise from that perspective? O\u2019KEEFE: Theodore Roosevelt is not a Horatio Alger story. He does not rise from humble beginnings to find his way to the upper echelons of power and wealth in America. Interestingly, the expectation in the Victorian and Gilded Age was that those with the greatest amount in society owed very little back to the people. Theodore Roosevelt, like his distant cousin Franklin Roosevelt, was considered a traitor to his class. It was very unusual for someone of his status and wealth to run for office. Politics was seen as a dirty business, something that the middle and lower classes, that the immigrant class would be interested in, because why would you need the power of the vote? You have wealth. You have influence. I think some of that is due to the influence of his parents, Mittie and Thee (Theodore Sr.), a Southerner and a Northerner, who were able to disagree without being disagreeable over one of the most contentious issues in American memory, the Civil War. He saw them come together as a family and be interested in the unity of their family as well as the country. He did have a noblesse oblige. He did feel that to whom much is given, much is required. And I think that experience out in the Badlands of North Dakota \u2014 where it didn\u2019t matter if you were wealthy; you were expected to work equally with the person alongside you. A horse in a roundup doesn\u2019t much care if you\u2019re from the East Side of Manhattan \u2014 you\u2019re either gonna survive and do the work or you\u2019re not gonna make it. Connecting Roosevelt to Biden WOLF: The most gripping part of the book is your description of the circumstances around his first wife dying in childbirth and his mother dying in the same house on the same day. I was trying to quantify that level of tragedy, and the first thing that popped to my mind was the current president, Joe Biden, who lost his wife and his daughter just after he was first elected to the Senate. I wonder if you also made that connection. O\u2019KEEFE: Absolutely. Loss which no one ever hopes to experience is often the crucible of an individual\u2019s life. In Theodore\u2019s circumstance, it was his mother, Mittie, after his father\u2019s death, that said, we need to live for the living, not for the dead \u2014 that you would dishonor the memory of those who are gone if you did not live a life of purpose. I think that\u2019s very similar to President Biden\u2019s circumstances, absolutely. You know, he took the seat in the Senate that then, of course, he held for 36 years, in part because it would be a dishonor to the memory of his wife and daughter if he didn\u2019t. Loss and happenstance, fate and serendipity play such an incredible role in American history. You have to look at these moments, these crucible moments, as the turning points of not just these individual political lives but how they intertwine with the fate of the nation. A new focus on 21st-century masculinity WOLF: There\u2019s been a rise recently, particularly on the American political right, of men trying to reassert masculinity. Josh Hawley, the Missouri senator who wrote a book about Roosevelt, more recently has a book called \u201cManhood,\u201d for instance. What do you think Roosevelt would make of that trend? O\u2019KEEFE: It\u2019s exactly what he was experiencing at his time. When Roosevelt was born in 1858, there\u2019s no electricity, there\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no airplanes, there\u2019s no submarines. He will be the first president to go up on an airplane, to ride a car, to travel abroad while president, to go in a submarine. Everything changes, right? The society is shifting from agrarian to industrial. The technology that is coming in this age is disrupting how people feel about their sense of self and connection and community. There\u2019s an immigration wave in the country that, in the view of many, is changing what the definition of what an American is, and there\u2019s a fierce debate about whether we\u2019re an isolationist country, or we\u2019re going to be a global power. Does any of this sound familiar? This all intersects with masculinity and gender roles, right? There are constant themes of masculinity. How to be a man. What does it mean to be a man. What do you have to physically do in order to show that you\u2019re a man. He\u2019ll project the quintessential ideal of manhood in society\u2019s expectations at the turn of the 20th century. But what I\u2019m showing in \u201cThe Loves of Theodore Roosevelt\u201d is that he too had this incredible emotional, soft side \u2014 that it was women, who were constrained by the age, working with him to achieve his goals. To your question about what is happening now, people trying to understand gender roles, masculinity, manhood \u2014 instead of looking at it as a continuum, trying to sort of define it as one or the other, to me, it sounds very much like something I\u2019ve heard before, if you pay attention to history. The duality of Roosevelt in the killing of a dog WOLF: There\u2019s a moment in the book when Roosevelt has just had a falling-out with Edith, his childhood sweetheart, who would later become his second wife. He\u2019s riding his horse home and, in a moment of pique, shoots a neighbor\u2019s dog. As I was reading that passage, I immediately thought of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who has faced serious backlash for writing in her memoir about shooting a family dog who was unruly. Obviously, the 19th century was a different time, but I wondered if you thought of Roosevelt when you read about Noem, a Dakota lawmaker. Is she not just living \u201cthe strenuous life?\u201d O\u2019KEEFE: There\u2019s a stark difference between a family pet, as described by the governor of South Dakota, and an animal running in the Oyster Bay woods (in New York) that was owned by a neighbor. But this is the duality of Theodore Roosevelt. If you go out to Sagamore Hill (Roosevelt\u2019s home), to this day, one of the most touching parts is the pet cemetery, where they\u2019ve got the graves of all the different, many beloved animals that they had. The Roosevelts had a menagerie, a veritable zoo at the White House \u2014 Josiah the badger and Emily Spinach, the snake whom Alice (his daughter, who was named for her mother) named because she didn\u2019t like her aunt, Emily, and she didn\u2019t like spinach, so her snake must be Emily Spinach; Algonquin, the pony who was taken up to the second floor of the White House. They had so many dogs in their home, both in Sagamore and in the White House, that the pet cemetery is filled with the names of these beloved family pets. So it\u2019s incongruous with Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s attitude about pets and animals, but yes, it is true that after he broke up with Edith, he was so angry that he did indeed shoot a dog on a horseback ride through the woods around Oyster Bay. An unusual parallel, perhaps, to today\u2019s stories.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/teddy-roosevelt-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_republicans-trump-verdict", "text": "Former President Donald Trump lost Rep. Mike Garcia\u2019s district by more than 12 points four years ago. And that was before he was convicted on 34 felony charges. But that doesn\u2019t mean the California Republican is abandoning Trump. \u201cNo,\u201d Garcia said when asked if the conviction shook his confidence in his party\u2019s standard bearer. \u201cI mean, the alternative is Joe Biden. There\u2019s obviously no way I can support four more years of Joe Biden.\u201d Garcia is hardly alone. In many bellwether districts that will determine the next House majority, including in the 19 GOP districts Biden carried in 2020, Republicans are quickly falling in line behind Trump. And they\u2019re echoing his line that the New York hush money trial was unfair and that he\u2019s a victim being persecuted, aligning with a riled-up base and effectively gambling that swing voters won\u2019t punish them for backing a felon at the top of the ticket. \u201cMy district is full of very smart people with a firm grasp of reality,\u201d said Rep. John Duarte, a fellow California Republican whose district Biden carried by 13 points four years ago. \u201cThey can smell bullsh*t.\u201d In past eras of politics, candidates in difficult races would be quick to distance themselves from a presidential contender with a hint of baggage \u2013 let alone one who has been convicted of a crime. But in the Trump era, Republicans have calculated that it pays dividends to stay on the team as vulnerable House and Senate Democrats are tiptoeing around Trump\u2019s conviction \u2013 and keeping their distance from Biden. Yet while GOP party committees are seeing a surge of fundraising after the verdict, senior Republicans are wary that going too far over Trump\u2019s legal woes \u2013 and embracing his talk about retribution against his enemies \u2013 could overwhelm their message in the fall as they try to woo disaffected Biden voters who will be central to holding onto their narrow majority in the House. \u201cI think we need to be focused on the issues that the American people care about: The economy, open border, and crime,\u201d said Rep. Richard Hudson, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm. While he called the verdict a \u201cpolitical hit job,\u201d Hudson added: \u201cI think this election ultimately is going to be decided on the issues.\u201d House Democratic leaders say they are more than happy that vulnerable Republicans have defended Trump after the guilty verdict. \u201cI think the ones who fall in line are Republicans who seem to do everything to show their blind loyalty to Donald Trump,\u201d said Rep. Suzan DelBene\u00a0of Washington state, who chairs the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm. \u201cPeople want folks who are going to stand up for their communities, who are going to stand up to govern, and who are true voices for their community.\u201d George Whitesides, the Democratic candidate seeking to defeat Garcia in the fall, said that his GOP foe\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s conviction is an issue he will hammer home. \u201cIt is remarkable that Mike Garcia who says he\u2019s supportive of the American law enforcement system has no concerns of someone who has been convicted of 34 felonies,\u201d Whitesides said. \u201cI can tell you the people of the 27th\u00a0District\u00a0of California have huge concerns about it.\u201d Garcia said that the choice boils down to \u201cJoe Biden who\u2019s the worst president in the history of the country\u201d and someone \u201cwho\u2019s got a proven track record, pro-security, pro-law enforcement,\u201d referring to Trump. Several other vulnerable members made clear where they stood. \u201cWell, he\u2019s the Republican nominee. I\u2019m the Republican,\u201d said Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whose Oregon district Biden won by eight points in 2020, confirming she\u2019s sticking with Trump after his conviction. Rep. Mike Lawler, whose New York district Biden carried by 10 points, sharply criticized the prosecution against Trump. And he pointedly said: \u201cI already said I am\u201d when asked if he still backs Trump at the top of his ticket. \u201cLook, the process itself will play out in court,\u201d Lawler told CNN. \u201cBut again, when you have an election that will be determined by the American people, a nomination that was determined by Republican primary voters, you respect the process.\u201d Endangered Democrats sidestep on Trump verdict Vulnerable incumbent Democrats are taking a different approach \u2013 particularly House members from districts that Trump carried and Senate Democrats in red and purple states. They are saying little about the verdict as they try to court Trump voters, instead trying to raise character concerns about their GOP opponents while campaigning on economic issues like prescription drug prices and social issues like abortion. In Ohio and Montana, two states that Trump carried twice, GOP candidates Bernie Moreno and Tim Sheehy are attacking Democrats Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester over the conviction. Sheehy is already up with a campaign ad accusing Tester of standing by prosecutors who are trying to \u201cthrow Trump in jail.\u201d In an interview last week, Tester struck a neutral tone when asked if he agreed with the verdict. \u201cWhat I agree on is nobody is above the law,\u201d Tester said. \u201cHe went through the process, trial by jury of his peers. And he has right to appeal it.\u201d Asked about GOP demands that he condemn the verdict, Tester said: \u201cLook, the Republicans think that I\u2019m the one who sat on the jury, for Christ\u2019s sake, OK? They\u2019re grasping at straws on that one.\u201d Brown said even less. \u201cI\u2019ve put\u00a0out\u00a0a\u00a0statement,\u201d Brown said last week. \u201cI\u00a0said\u00a0what I\u00a0said.\u201d In that statement, Brown also said that \u201cno one is above the law\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s up to the legal system to sort\u201d out before voters ultimately decide in November. Other vulnerable Democrats were also cautious. \u201cThe jury made a decision and that\u2019s their decision,\u201d said Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, when asked if he agreed with the verdict. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what the next step is.\u201d GOP divide over Trump\u2019s talk of retribution In the days following Trump\u2019s conviction, Republicans have brought forward an onslaught of proposals, including to defund federal and state prosecutions targeting Trump, threatening a government shutdown and a longshot impeachment of Biden. Those actions and rhetoric have some Republicans worried that the party could get itself off message ahead of November. GOP Rep. Nick LaLota, a Republican running in a competitive New York district Biden won in 2020, cautioned his Republican colleagues against engaging in a \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d revenge scheme that reaches beyond targeting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t overreact or misreact by acting upon things that had nothing to do with this hasty trial,\u201d LaLota, who rallied behind Trump after the verdict, told CNN. And Republican Sen. Thom\u00a0Tillis, who is close to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell,\u00a0warned his GOP colleagues that it would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d to shift their focus away from kitchen table issues like the economy and the Biden administration\u2019s border policies as Republicans face the final stretch to November. \u201cThose are the key issues that are driving voters in November,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cWhy on earth, we would shift our attention away from that, for any sort of quick fix on this decision doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d Right-wing members, however, have gone full steam ahead in throwing their entire congressional and messaging weight behind Trump in the wake of his conviction. In a closed-door meeting with the GOP conference on Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson presented a three-pronged approach for how Republicans could use their majority in the House to go after the Department of Justice and state prosecutors, according to multiple sources. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan also outlined his proposal for defunding federal and state prosecutions targeting \u201cpolitical opponents,\u201d which he also detailed in a letter. While Johnson has previously dismissed calls to defund key parts of the DOJ \u2013 a move that would be dead arrival in the Senate \u2013 Jordan said he believes Johnson has been warming up to the idea in recent days, especially after Trump\u2019s conviction. Separately, GOP Rep. Chip Roy suggested to CNN that initiating a government shutdown fight should be \u201con the table,\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s conviction. \u201cI\u2019ll walk into the election, and I\u2019ll message that,\u201d Roy said. One of Trump\u2019s loudest supporters on the Hill, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, marched into Johnson\u2019s office later Tuesday with an accountability list of her own, including a long-shot effort to impeach Biden. \u201cRepublicans across the country, and many Americans in general, are sick and tired and fed up with a feckless, useless Republican Party and conference that does nothing,\u201d Greene said after her meeting with Johnson. Republicans in this camp believe there is no limit to how hard they can lean in to talking about Trump\u2019s conviction and see the Trump verdict as a golden ticket. GOP Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican hardliner from South Carolina, said Republicans would \u201cabsolutely\u201d retaliate against Trump\u2019s political enemies after November, including prosecutors. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is, is weaponized process,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is wrong, against the Constitution.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we continue to have the alliances we have, continue to beef up those alliances, continue to keep NATO strong, continue to do what we\u2019ve been able to do for the last \u2013 since the end of World War II,\u201d Biden told reporters after participating in a wreath-laying ceremony. Asked whether he believes that Americans\u2019 views of alliances are changing, Biden spoke broadly, but appeared to misspeak as he pointed to delayed congressional aid for Iraq, rather than Ukraine. \u201cI think Americans hold the view \u2013 I think there\u2019s a new a rising sense of some in the country wanting to let that slip. The idea that we become semi-isolationist now, which some are talking about? I mean, the idea we had to wait all those months just to get the money for Iraq and we \u2026 because we\u2019re waiting \u2013 I mean, it just \u2013 it just \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s not who we are. It\u2019s not who America is,\u201d Biden said. The president has repeatedly cast blame on congressional Republicans for delaying aid to Ukraine, and personally apologized to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the holdup earlier this week. Biden said Sunday it was important for him to make the trip to Aisne-Marne to pay tribute as a show of support for alliances. \u201cThe idea that I come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute \u2026 think about it. America showed up. America showed up to stop the Germans. America showed up to make sure that they did not prevail. And America shows up when we\u2019re needed. Just like our allies show up for us,\u201d he said, offering an implicit criticism of Trump, whom he did not name. Biden has repeatedly criticized Trump for skipping the Aisne-Marne stop during his own trip. That trip was scrapped due to weather conditions and safety issues. The president\u2019s Marine One helicopter cannot fly in low cloud cover, a decision that is made by military and security officials. But there did not appear to be a backup plan, and Trump did not make any statements of regret over not being able to visit the cemetery. Biden, when asked what he hopes Americans take away from the trip, reiterated, \u201cKnowledge that the best way to avoid these kinds of battles in the future is to stay strong with our allies.

Bragg\u2019s office has resisted calls to testify before Congress citing the ongoing case against the former president, but in a letter Friday to GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bragg stated his willingness to testify at a future date. The letter from Bragg\u2019s general counsel said the Manhattan DA\u2019s office is willing to engage with the committee to decide a date for the testimony as well as to\u00a0\u201cbetter\u00a0understand the scope and the purpose of the proposed hearing.\u201d \u201cThis Office is committed to voluntary cooperation. That cooperation includes making the District Attorney available to provide testimony on behalf of the Office at an agreed-upon date, and evaluating the propriety of allowing an Assistant District Attorney to testify publicly about an active prosecution to which he is assigned,\u201d the letter reads. A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on\u00a034 felony charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on May 30. Bragg, a Democrat, presented the first indictment of a former US president when he announced charges against Trump last year. Bragg accused Trump of falsifying the repayment of his former lawyer Michael Cohen in order to cover up a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. Jordan then demanded Bragg and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo appear for a\u00a0hearing on June 13\u00a0after Trump\u2019s guilty verdict was reached. CNN has reached out to the DA\u2019s office as well as Jordan\u2019s office for additional information. Bragg\u2019s willingness to testify is the latest action in a series of attempts by House Republicans to try to defend Trump amid his legal troubles by going after those involved in his cases. Jordan, along with House Oversight Chairman James Comer and House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil,\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0calling for Bragg\u2019s testimony last year ahead of the trial and criticized Bragg\u2019s investigation into the former president as an\u00a0\u201cunprecedented\u00a0abuse of prosecutorial authority.\u201d Along with Bragg, Jordan has previously looked to investigate other members in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office, as key allies of Trump attempted to frame his criminal charges as politically motivated. Jordan\u00a0subpoenaed\u00a0former New York County Special Assistant District Attorney Mark Pomerantz last year for his role investigating Trump and his business empire and sought\u00a0voluntary cooperation\u00a0from Colangelo.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-charges", "text": "The federal judge overseeing the federal criminal classified documents case against Donald Trump and his two co-defendants in Florida has denied efforts to dismiss nearly 10 of the 41 charges in the indictment against them on several technical issues. District Judge Aileen Cannon did, however, agree with the defendants that some of the language in the indictment was \u201clegally unnecessary\u201d and ruled that one of the paragraphs would be removed from the indictment. In the small win for the defense, Cannon rejected prosecutors\u2019 rationale for including a paragraph in the charges that laid out an episode in which Trump allegedly showed an unnamed representative of his political organization a classified map and commented that he should not be showing the map to the individual. Prosecutors had pointed to a procedural rule that allows the admission of evidence that relates to uncharged conduct. However, Cannon said Monday that such evidence should be subjected to certain pretrial litigation before it is allowed to come into a case. In explaining that narrow ruling, she took swipes at the prosecutors for their use of a so-called speaking indictment, meaning an indictment that goes beyond the sparse legal requirements for charging someone and gives a fuller narrative of the allegations. Cannon noted in her order that \u201cthe risks that can flow from a prosecutor\u2019s decision to include in a charging document an extensive narrative account of his or her view of the facts, especially in cases of significant public interest.\u201d While Trump and his co-defendants raised several other technical issues they saw with charges in the indictment, including duplicity issues, the judge ultimately found those \u201cidentified deficiencies, even if generating some arguable confusion, are either permitted by law, raise evidentiary challenges not appropriate for disposition at this juncture.\u201d Cannon also said that as long as the jury was \u201cinstructed appropriately and presented with adequate verdict forms as to each Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct\u201d there wasn\u2019t an issue.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/judge-cannon-trump-classified-documents-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_takeaways-day-6-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "The jury in Hunter Biden\u2019s federal gun trial began deliberations on Monday after the defendant declined to testify in his own defense and both sides presented closing arguments in the historic case against the president\u2019s son. Special counsel David Weiss\u2019 prosecutors urged the jury to bring back three guilty verdicts because, even though the evidence was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cugly,\u201d it was also \u201coverwhelming\u201d that Biden bought and possessed a firearm while abusing drugs. Later, Biden\u2019s defense attorney argued that the prosecutors\u2019 case was similar to a \u201cmagician\u2019s trick,\u201d and accused Weiss\u2019 team of trying to inflate the evidence and win convictions based on \u201csuspicion and conjecture\u201d alone. If convicted, Biden could face up to 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $750,000, though first-time offenders like him rarely receive the maximum penalty. He pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Here are takeaways from Day 6 of the historic trial. \u2018No one is above the law,\u2019 prosecutors say In the first seconds of Leo Wise\u2019s closing arguments, he referenced the VIPs from the Biden family that have been filling the front row of the courtroom pews each day, often including\u00a0first lady Jill Biden, who was in attendance on Monday. \u201cThe people sitting in the gallery are not evidence,\u201d Wise said. \u201cYou may recognize some of them from the news or from the community \u2026 but respectfully, none of that matters.\u201d The first three rows of court were completely filled with Hunter Biden\u2019s friends and family, and a Secret Service agent could barely fit at the end of the front-row bench, with so many people trying to squeeze in. Jill Biden sat flanked by her son\u2019s wife on one side, and the first lady\u2019s daughter Ashley Biden on the other. As Wise continued, he returned to a theme that his colleague raised in opening statements: that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d Jurors, he said, shouldn\u2019t treat this case differently \u201cbecause of who the defendant is.\u201d Evidence was \u2018ugly\u2019 but \u2018overwhelming,\u2019 prosecutors say Wise went on to explain to the jury \u2013 which includes many people whose loved ones are struggling with addiction \u2013 why the prosecution went into so many excruciating details about the defendant\u2019s spiral into crack cocaine abuse. \u201cThe evidence was personal, it was ugly, and it was overwhelming. It was also absolutely necessary,\u201d Wise said. \u201cThere is no other way to prove the use of drugs or addiction to drugs than through the kind of evidence that you saw.\u201d He noted, accurately, that the judge\u2019s instructions don\u2019t require the Justice Department to prove that Biden used drugs on a specific day, but only that he was \u201cactively engaged\u201d in drugs around that time. Recalling key testimony from earlier witnesses, Wise highlighted Biden\u2019s ex-girlfriend who testified that she saw him smoking crack in September 2018, less than two weeks before he bought the gun. Furthermore, he pointed out that Biden\u2019s rehab stints shortly before and after buying the firearm speaks to his \u201cpattern\u201d of drug use around that time. \u201cYou could convict on those facts alone,\u201d he said. \u2018It\u2019s time to end this case,\u2019 defense says During his nearly 90-minute closing argument, defense attorney Abbe Lowell forcefully made the case that prosecutors hadn\u2019t met the high burden to prove Biden\u2019s guilt, pointing to the issue of whether he knowingly violated the law. Lowell repeatedly said that prosecutors showed no direct evidence that Biden was using illegal drugs during October 2018, when he bought the firearm, comparing their case to a slight-of-hand deception. \u201cHave you ever seen the magician\u2019s trick of having you look at this hand, while in the other hand is where the trick is being done? Look at this \u2013 and then see that in the hand that matters, there is nothing there,\u201d Lowell said, invoking a motif that he raised several times during closing arguments. In order to reach a guilty verdict, prosecutors need to prove that Biden was \u201cconscious and aware\u201d of the law and how he was violating it, Lowell argued. \u201cWith this very high burden, it\u2019s time to end this case,\u201d Lowell said. Poking holes in key witness testimony The defense attorney also said there were serious flaws with the testimony from three of Biden\u2019s exes who testified in the case. Lowell noted that Hallie Biden couldn\u2019t remember key details from the day she found Biden\u2019s firearm in his truck. Lowell also questioned the veracity of\u00a0claims from Zoe Kestan\u00a0\u2013 who met Biden at a gentleman\u2019s club where she worked \u2013 noting the immunity deal she reached with prosecutors beforehand. Lowell said Kestan met with prosecutors many times \u201cto rehearse\u201d her testimony \u2013 instantly drawing an objection from the special counsel\u2019s team. Lowell also pointed out that Kestan took many pictures of Biden with drugs when they were together, but none from the critical month when he bought the gun. Lowell also attacked the prosecutors\u2019 case as based on \u201csuspicion\u201d and \u201cconjecture,\u201d phrases that he repeated many times, perhaps hoping to sow some doubt among the jurors. \u201cThere was no actual witness to the drug use in this period of time,\u201d Lowell asserted. Clash over Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony The two sides clashed over the\u00a0testimony of Naomi Biden, who was called as a defense witness on Friday. In his closing arguments, Lowell said prosecutors were \u201cextraordinarily cruel\u201d to Biden\u2019s daughter by asking her during their cross-examination if she ever used cocaine. They posed that question while trying to establish that, because she doesn\u2019t do drugs, it was likely her father who left crack remnants in their shared truck. Lowell glared directly at prosecutors as he criticized the prosecutors, raising his voice and banging his fist on the lectern. But after he was done, prosecutors quickly shot back, telling the jury that they believed Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony actually hurt her father\u2019s defense. \u201cWho called the defendant\u2019s daughter as a witness in this case? Not us,\u201d prosecutor Derek Hines said during his rebuttal. \u201c\u2026 And you saw up there on the stand how uncomfortable she was. The anguish sitting there knowing she was testifying as a defense witness, but she had to tell the truth.\u201d He argued that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t vouch for the defendant\u2019s sobriety throughout that month of October\u201d 2018 when he bought the gun because she swore to tell the truth and could be prosecuted if she lied. Hunter Biden doesn\u2019t testify As last week\u2019s proceedings wrapped up on Friday, Lowell told the judge the defense team was still making the decision over whether their client would testify in his own defense. That would\u2019ve been an extremely risky move that could have opened the president\u2019s son up to intense and potentially expansive questioning from the special counsel prosecutors. Ultimately, however, Lowell said Monday that Biden would not testify and instructions to the jury were adjusted to make it clear they aren\u2019t allowed to hold that decision against him in their deliberations. The jury will continue its deliberations Tuesday morning.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_trump-endorses-sam-brown-nevada-gop-senate-primary", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u00a0on Sunday endorsed retired Army captain Sam Brown for Senate ahead of the Nevada\u00a0GOP primary this week. \u201cSam Brown is a FEARLESS AMERICAN PATRIOT, a Purple Heart Recipient, who has proven he has the \u2018PURE GRIT\u2019 and COURAGE to take on our Enemies, both Foreign and Domestic,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. The former president hailed Brown, who was severely burned by the explosion of a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, for making \u201cthe Comeback of a Lifetime.\u201d \u201cSam Brown has my Complete and Total Endorsement - HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\u201d Trump said. Brown is vying for the GOP nomination against Dr. Jeffrey Gunter, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Iceland, and former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, who has championed Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims. The general election race against incumbent\u00a0Democratic\u00a0Sen. Jacky Rosen is expected to be one of the country\u2019s\u00a0most competitive. It was initially unclear whether the former president would endorse a candidate in the race, with Brown drawing the ire of many staunch Trump supporters who privately encouraged the former president to back Gunter. While Brown door-knocked for Trump in 2020, he later appeared to distance himself from the former president, declining to tell Punchbowl News in an August interview whether he would be \u201ccomfortable with sharing the GOP ticket with Trump in Nevada.\u201d He eventually endorsed Trump before the Iowa caucuses. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz held a rally for Gunter in Nevada in April, and far-right activists and Mar-a-Lago regulars Laura Loomer and Roger Stone have railed against Brown on social media for his ties to more mainstream Republicans. But Brown has been the strongest fundraiser of all the GOP primary candidates, raising considerably more than Gunter as of last month. Following Trump\u2019s endorsement, Rosen posted on X that Brown\u2019s \u201cagenda of banning abortion, gutting health care, and slashing Social Security is wrong for Nevada. We\u2019re going to defeat MAGA extremism in November.\u201d Brown first emerged on the Nevada political scene in the 2022 cycle, when his grassroots Senate campaign \u2013 under the slogan \u201cduty first\u201d \u2013 won him admirers on the way to a second-place finish in the GOP primary. The winner, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, went on to lose narrowly to\u00a0Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u00a0in the general election. Brown is still somewhat of a political newcomer. He lost a state legislative race in Texas in 2014. He was not a significant figure in the political landscape of Nevada, where he moved in 2018, until his 2022 Senate bid picked up momentum in the primary\u2019s closing months.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/trump-endorses-sam-brown-nevada-gop-senate-primary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_biden-trump-democracy-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is in Europe, warning of totalitarian evil and the dangers to democracy. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is back home, seeking a favor from Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, mulling revenge and trashing US elections. The former president is making his 2024 opponent\u2019s case \u2014 that the West is being challenged by unprecedented threats to the rule of law from hostile forces outside and in. But Trump\u2019s strength also suggests that the centerpiece of Biden\u2019s trip \u2014 an homage on Friday in Normandy to one of former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s greatest speeches \u2014 may fall on many deaf ears back in America. The former president is showing in every speech and public appearance that the seduction of demagoguery, the demonization of outsiders and the language of extremism is as potent now as it was before World War II. The 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day invasion that led to the liberation of Europe have turned into a rallying point for Western leaders warning that the darkest forces of political extremism are awakening. They have also used their meetings and speeches to draw parallels between Putin\u2019s vicious assault on Ukraine and Adolf Hitler\u2019s blitzkrieg. There\u2019s nothing new in a modern US president traveling to Europe to invoke the shared history of victory over tyranny. But no other commander in chief has done so after his predecessor tried to destroy democracy to stay in office. The possibility that Biden could lose reelection \u2014 and the threat of a return to the chaos Trump inflicted on European allies \u2014 has cast an ominous shadow over the trip. On Friday, Biden will send an unmistakable message by co-opting the legacy of Reagan \u2014 one of the greatest Republican presidents \u2014 to suggest that his rival is an affront to US and GOP values. In 1984, atop a cliff stormed by US Army Rangers on June 6, 1944, known as the Pointe du Hoc, the 40th president denounced US isolationism. He also invoked the war against Nazism to summon the West to a renewed and ultimately successful Cold War struggle against another form of extremism \u2014 Kremlin-style communism. Biden will imply that Trump, with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, attacks on the integrity of the free and fair 2020 election and use of extreme anti-immigrant rhetoric that echoes that of the Nazis, is summoning the same forces that triggered global war. Can the Gipper win one for Biden? Biden, who will almost certainly be the last US president to have been born during World War II, is asking Americans to muster the same commitment to democratic values as the greatest generation whose last representatives are now slipping away. \u201cIn memory of those who fought here, died here, literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice,\u201d Biden said Thursday, surrounded by the graves of more than 9,000 Americans. \u201cLet us be the generation that when history is written about our time \u2014 in 10, 20, 30, 50, 80 years from now \u2014 it will be said: \u2018When the moment came, we met the moment. We stood strong. Our alliances were made stronger.\u00a0And we saved democracy in our time as well.\u2019\u201d That a president should have to make such an argument shows how the political climate has shifted since Reagan stood on the same spot 40 years ago and filled many eyes with tears by turning to veterans and saying, \u201cThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who scaled the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped win a war.\u201d Back then, the GOP was an internationalist, pro-democracy party. It proudly boasted about how Reagan won the Cold War until Trump mixed his cocktail of isolationism and populism that looks more kindly on Putin than US allies. It is that defining shift in outlook that may mean that Biden\u2019s speech is an effective piece of political theater but has limited political appeal. The White House and the Biden campaign won\u2019t expect that invoking the spirit of the Gipper will dent Trump\u2019s lock on Republican base voters. But the president is seeking to win over disaffected national security Republicans nostalgic for the days when a hawkish foreign policy was seen as one leg of the fabled conservative policy stool. And he\u2019s especially seeking to attract some of the tens of thousands of Republicans who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the party\u2019s primary long after she suspended her campaign. The former United Nations ambassador under Trump might have endorsed her former boss and accused Biden of weakness on the global stage. But she\u2019s far more aligned with the current president\u2019s global outlook and disdain for dictators than she is with Trump\u2019s brand of strongman appeasement. Trump back on the trail Biden\u2019s visit to Europe has coincided with his predecessor\u2019s return to the campaign trail following his felony conviction last week in a hush money trial in New York. Trump chose the moment to issue his latest opening to Putin, an accused war criminal before whom he genuflected while president. The presumptive GOP nominee insisted that he\u2019d be able to free an imprisoned American reporter. \u201cEvan Gershkovich, the reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is being held by Russia, will be released almost immediately after the election,\u201d Trump said in a video posted on Truth Social on Tuesday. \u201cBut definitely before I assume office, he will be home, he will be safe. Vladimir Putin, President of Russia will do that for me \u2026 and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll do it for anyone else.\u201d This was far from the first time that Trump has sought to demonstrate special influence with Putin. After all, he once said in a news conference in Helsinki that he believed the Russian leader, who was standing beside him, rather than the US intelligence agencies he led, on the question of Kremlin election interference. Trump\u2019s politicization of the Gershkovich case was notable since it comes after months of quiet US government efforts to free the reporter and another imprisoned American, former Marine Paul Whelan. It raises the possibility that the Russians may simply manipulate any negotiations in the assumption that Trump may give them a better deal or that the Biden administration may be prepared to pay a higher price before the election. If the Kremlin eventually did free the reporter to Trump, it could be a coup for him and would ensure he is in Moscow\u2019s debt. Trump\u2019s outreach to Putin comes at a time when the Russian president is ostracized from the international community over the barbaric assaults on civilians in Ukraine and as he imposes the greatest threat to the integrity of continental Europe since the war that Biden flew across the Atlantic to commemorate. Using the plight of an American in the ruthless Russian penal system to score political points is also one of the more cynical modern campaign gambits. Russia shrugged off Trump\u2019s remarks on Thursday, saying that the release of Gershkovich would only happen as a result of reciprocity. After Trump played nice to Putin, the sitting president went out of his way to denounce the Russian leader, who was not invited to the D-Day events despite the Soviet Union\u2019s decisive role in the defeat of Nazism. \u201cHe\u2019s not a decent man \u2014 he\u2019s a dictator, and he\u2019s struggling to make sure he holds his country together while still keeping this assault going,\u201d Biden told ABC News in an interview. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was there instead. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s first campaign event as a felon on Thursday illustrated why the election could be so close. He was before a self-selecting crowd of supporters at a Turning Point Action Town Hall and spelled out a demagogic appeal that is effective with Republican base voters. He renewed his falsehoods about fraud in the last election, insisting he planned to win a mandate in November that was \u201ctoo big to rig.\u201d He attacked the legal system following his conviction by a jury of his peers, baselessly insisting that the verdict was \u201crigged.\u201d And in the border state of Arizona, he fired off searing anti-immigrant rhetoric, much of which was alarmist and false about the crisis on the border but that may prove an effective counterpoint to Biden\u2019s attempt this week to ease his exposure on the issue by massively curtailing asylum claims. The former president has consistently refused to guarantee he will accept the result of November\u2019s election. And several times this week, he has also implied that he would use presidential power to prosecute his political opponents, threatening a fresh assault on the rule of law. \u201cWell revenge does take time, I will say that, and sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest,\u201d Trump said during an interview with \u201cDr. Phil Primetime\u201d that aired Thursday. \u201cYou know, sometimes it can.\u201d At the Thursday town hall, the former president marveled at the fact that many of his questions, from an albeit friendly crowd, were about the high cost of living, the struggle of Arizonans to buy groceries and their perception that they are unsafe because of out-of-control arrivals of undocumented migrants at the border. This may be the decisive election equation in a nutshell: Trump will wield economic and immigration issues to counter Biden\u2019s warnings that his rival\u2019s anti-democratic and autocratic leanings make him unfit to be president again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/biden-trump-democracy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_aid-gaza-resumes-us-pier", "text": "Maritime aid deliveries to Gaza resumed Saturday after a US-built temporary pier was repaired a day prior, US Central Command announced. Nearly 500 metric tons, or over a million pounds, of aid was delivered beginning Saturday morning local time, CENTCOM said in a post on X, the first delivery since the pier broke apart last month. The delivery came the same day the Israeli military rescued four hostages in an operation that authorities in Gaza said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others. CENTCOM made it clear Saturday that the pier, \u201cincluding its equipment, personnel, and assets,\u201d was not used in the operation. \u201cThe temporary pier on the coast of Gaza was put in place for one purpose only, to help move additional, urgently needed lifesaving assistance into Gaza,\u201d CENTCOM said in a separate post on X. And a US official told CNN on Saturday that the pier, called Joint Logistics Over the Shore, or JLOTS, was not used in the operation. \u201cIt is our understanding that IDF did not use a vehicle with humanitarian markings, or any humanitarian platform, including the JLOTS facility, to conduct hostage rescue operations,\u201d the official said. The pier, used in addition to\u00a0dropping aid out of planes and trucking it through border checkpoints, sustained damage and broke apart\u00a0in heavy seas\u00a0late last month. In the less than two weeks the pier was operational, it helped deliver some 1,000 metric tons of aid to Gaza. The US had faced\u00a0a number of challenges\u00a0with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah, establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza, and logistical issues such as sea and weather conditions. Eight months into the Israel-Hamas war, human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions in Gaza. The United Nations\u2019 food agency\u00a0warned in May\u00a0that Palestinians in the north are under a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d that is spreading south, and more than 1 million people, half of Gaza\u2019s population, are \u201cexpected to face death and starvation\u201d by mid-July, a UN report warned this week. While Israeli officials have insisted there is no limit on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, the UN has accused authorities of imposing \u201cunlawful restrictions\u201d on relief operations, including blocked land routes, communications blackouts and air strikes. The US has made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, though they were suspended in recent weeks due to military operations in the north of Gaza, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper said Friday. Air drops are expected to resume \u201cin the coming days,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_bob-menendez-bribery-trial", "text": "For more than four weeks, Sen. Bob Menendez has been a mostly peripheral figure at his bribery and corruption trial. On Monday, at federal court in Lower Manhattan, the New Jersey Democrat became the main character. Prosecutors\u2019 star witness, businessman Jose Uribe, told the jury for the first time that Menendez helped drive the wider conspiracy that ensnared the senator; his wife, Nadine Menendez; and two co-defendants. In his testimony, Uribe, who pleaded guilty before the trial began and is cooperating with prosecutors, described Menendez as a Godfather-like character who lorded his power over others and, by his deeds and demeanor, appeared to many as an all-powerful figure with vast influence in all walks of life. Menendez, in Uribe\u2019s telling, rarely asked any questions and provided only a blinkered view into his plans and actions. But months after allegedly delivering on the key pieces of the bribery scheme, Menendez, during a 2020\u00a0dinner with Uribe, sat back, his hands crossed over his stomach, and reminded the businessman of all he\u2019d done. \u201cI saved your a** twice. Not once, but twice,\u201d Menendez told him in Spanish, Uribe testified. Nadine and her adult daughter, who were also at the dinner, had just excused themselves to use the bathroom. Before they returned, the senator bragged that it had not been difficult work, but Uribe said his body language suggested that \u201che was proud and confident that he got this done.\u201d Uribe, who first took the stand on Friday, described a series of meetings with Bob and Nadine Menendez as he sought the senator\u2019s help in quashing the prosecution of an associate and a state investigation that he feared would ultimately lead back to his businesses and the close friends who nominally ran them. Those concerns, Uribe said, led him to leverage his relationship with Nadine Menendez \u2013 most notably the Mercedes-Benz convertible he purchased for her \u2013 into audiences with the senator and, eventually, the interventions that led to the Menendezes being charged with conspiring to accept gold bars, bricks of cash and a swishy car in exchange for an assortment of political and legal favors. (Nadine Menendez, who is being treated for breast cancer, is being tried separately, likely in July.) Lawyers for Bob Menendez have sought to portray him as an afterthought in the matter. In their opening arguments, they urged the jury to consider the question \u201cWhere\u2019s Bob?\u201d \u2013 asserting that he was either unaware or not involved in the machinations alleged by prosecutors. It was his then-girlfriend Nadine driving the bus, they said, with the senator evincing only a partial, passive awareness of her actions. Uribe told a different story. In one meeting on the patio in Nadine\u2019s backyard in September 2019, the night before Menendez met with New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, Uribe said the senator asked him to write down the names of the people and businesses at the heart of Uribe\u2019s \u201cworries.\u201d In Uribe\u2019s telling, after a brief chat, Menendez called out \u201cmon amour\u201d to Nadine, who was inside the home, while ringing a little bell set up on their backyard table. Nadine emerged with paper and disappeared back inside before Uribe began to write. The senator did not offer much information in return, Uribe said. The next morning, Uribe texted Nadine \u2013 according to phone records \u2013 thanking her \u201cfor everything you do for me\u201d and saying he was \u201cpraying today\u2019s meeting is in GOD\u2019s hand.\u201d Uribe said he did not know, even then, with whom Menendez would be sitting down. Hours later, though, he received another message from Nadine, this time asking him to meet the senator at Menendez\u2019s New Jersey apartment building. (The couple was not yet married and kept separate residences.) Uribe recalled entering to see Menendez chatting in the lobby with a receptionist. The two then walked toward a quieter corner and began to chat. \u201cThe thing you asked me about, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything there,\u201d Menendez said, according to Uribe, who took it to mean that, while nothing was formally settled, he should no longer be concerned about a probe into his businesses or associates. Uribe said he left optimistic but unsettled. He had come through for Nadine, buying her a new car after she had totaled her old one in a fatal accident \u2013 a detail that has not been disclosed to the jury \u2013 and was desperate for her to help him \u201cstop and kill\u201d his looming legal troubles. \u201cPeace,\u201d as Uribe described it, came in time. About eight weeks later, he received a phone call at his home from a 202 area code \u2013 from Washington, DC. Menendez was on the other line, Uribe said, and told him the good news. \u201cThat thing you asked me about, there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Menendez told him. \u201cI give you your \u2018peace.\u2019\u201d Uribe became emotional as he spoke about the call. His work had come good. His fears were vanquished \u2013 all thanks, he said, to Bob Menendez. He texted Nadine, \u201cI got a call and I am a very happy person.\u201d \u201cGOD bless you and him for ever,\u201d she replied. Days later, Uribe and an associate met with the couple\u00a0at a local restaurant. Prosecutors showed the court a picture of the foursome smiling widely with champagne glasses raised \u2013 the bubbly had been sent to their table by other diners. One cause for celebration, Uribe said, went unspoken. Instead, they toasted the engagement of Nadine and Bob, who would get married in 2020. \u201cIt was the right place to be that day,\u201d an emotional Uribe told the court. Their gatherings slowed when the Covid-19 pandemic hit a few months later. The dinner when Menendez crowed about taking care of Uribe would not happen until August 2020, when they met to eat outside. Nearly two years would then pass with Uribe keeping in touch with the Menendezes as he tried to finagle a new insurance broker\u2019s license. His first one had been voided as part of a separate criminal probe years earlier. Not much came of those efforts, he said Monday, apart from a dead-end introduction. Uribe said he learned about the investigation that ultimately led him to plead guilty and testify against the senator in June 2022, when FBI agents turned up at his home, took his cell phone and handed him \u201csubpoenas\u201d for assorted documents and records largely related to his payments on Nadine Menendez\u2019s Mercedes. Nadine Menendez and Uribe would meet one more time \u2013 at a Marriott hotel bar in New Jersey, the same place Uribe and two associates first hatched the plan at the offering of Wael Hana. The Egyptian American businessman \u2013 a co-defendant in this case \u2013 told them he could parlay his own friendship with Nadine Menendez into assistance from the senator. It would, Hana allegedly said, cost between $200,000 and $250,000. During their 2022 chat, Nadine Menendez and Uribe shared notes on the federal probe. She asked him, he said, what he planned to tell the FBI about the car payments. Uribe told her he planned to say he was helping a friend and expected to be repaid. Nadine Menendez approved of the plan, he said. The payments would be retconned as a loan. She mailed his lawyer a check for $21,000, considerably less than what he had spent on the Mercedes. How, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz asked, did she arrive at that figure? \u201cNo idea,\u201d Uribe said. It was the last time they spoke.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/bob-menendez-bribery-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Donald Trump\u2019s former attorney was given 30 days to appear and get his mug shot and fingerprints taken, according to a Maricopa County court commissioner, after a problematic attempt by agents within the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office to serve Giuliani last month. Giuliani was served on May 17\u00a0in Palm Beach, Florida, at his 80th\u00a0birthday bash held by a GOP operative. Arizona prosecutors spent weeks trying to track down the former New York City mayor and eventually found him based on his podcasts.

{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_donald-trump-nevada-rally", "text": "Donald Trump proposed eliminating taxes on tips at a Sunday campaign rally in Las Vegas as he looks to win over voters in a critical swing state that has a sizable number of service\u00a0industry\u00a0workers. The proposal \u2014 which came at the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s first campaign rally since his historic conviction in his New York hush money trial last month \u2014 was immediately slammed by the state\u2019s powerful Culinary Union as \u201cwild campaign promises from a convicted felon.\u201d The former president\u2019s Las Vegas visit follows a flurry of stops that included high-dollar fundraisers in California and a campaign town hall in Arizona.\u00a0On Saturday night, he attended a fundraiser in Las Vegas hosted by construction equipment tycoon Don Ahern, a longtime ally. Trump co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita said Sunday the campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a total of $27.5 million from the four fundraisers Trump attended in recent days in California and Nevada. Trump\u2019s excursion out West comes at a critical juncture for his campaign as it looks to shift the narrative to his general election message after a seven-week criminal trial that culminated in his conviction on 34 felony counts related to a hush money scheme to pay off a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. During his visit to Las Vegas, the Trump campaign also launched\u00a0a new \u201cLatino Americans for Trump\u201d coalition, as it looks to increase its outreach to Hispanic voters ahead of November\u2019s election.\u00a0The decision to launch the new program in Nevada was no coincidence. Recent polling has indicated a noticeable shift toward Trump among Hispanic voters, who have traditionally voted Democratic. In a state like Nevada, where Latino voters make up a sizable portion of the electorate, siphoning away some of them could help deliver Trump the critical battleground state, and potentially the White House. Nevada has backed the Democratic nominee for president in four consecutive elections \u2013 but Joe Biden carried it by just 2 points in 2020. \u201cSome of us believe that we might be better positioned in Nevada [this cycle] than we are even in Georgia,\u201d one source close to Trump told CNN ahead of the rally. Trump campaign sources pointed specifically to the Covid-19 pandemic as a reason for their optimism. Nevada was particularly hard hit by the pandemic, given its dependence on tourism and hospitality. One senior adviser said ahead of the event that there are also plans to try to work with the state\u2019s Culinary Workers Union, which has traditionally worked closely with Democrats as part of a massive get-out-the-vote operation crafted by late Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. Last month, the union unendorsed several Democratic state lawmakers over their votes to remove Covid-era cleaning requirements placed on the casino industry. \u201cWhen I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips,\u201d Trump said at his rally. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do that right away, first thing in office because it\u2019s been a point of contention for years and years and years and you do a great job of service \u2014 you take care of people.\u201d The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 pushed back on Trump\u2019s promise, which would need congressional approval, on Sunday. \u201cFor decades, the Culinary Union has fought for tipped workers\u2019 rights and against unfair taxation,\u201d Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. \u201cRelief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.\u201d A critical moment As he did at his Phoenix town hall last week hosted by conservative group Turning Point Action, Trump on Sunday also railed against his conviction and touted the fundraising boon it\u2019s been for his campaign. In a series of interviews over the past week, Trump has refused to back away from his threats to seek retaliation against his political opponents if he wins the presidency. \u201cWell, revenge does take time. I will say that,\u201d Trump said in an interview with psychologist Phil McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil. \u201cAnd sometimes revenge can be justified. Phil, I have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d And while he called the people in prison for breaking into the Capitol on January 6, 2021, \u201cwarriors\u201d and continued to falsely claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol by police, Trump on Sunday also focused on immigration, which his team views as a core vulnerability for Biden ahead of November. In a potential attempt to address that vulnerability, Biden announced an executive action last week giving him the authority to effectively shut down the US-Mexico border to asylum seekers entering illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded. Trump bashed Biden repeatedly over the move during his Phoenix speech, calling it \u201cbullsh*t\u201d and vowing to revoke the new asylum restrictions if reelected. The Senate factor In addition to a marquee presidential race, Nevada is also playing host this year to what is expected to be one of the country\u2019s most competitive Senate contests as Democratic incumbent Jacky Rosen seeks a second term. Trump has faced pressure to back Sam Brown, a retired Army captain who was severely burned by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s GOP primary. And while he briefly complimented Brown at Sunday\u2019s rally, he didn\u2019t endorse him until hours later in a post on Truth Social. \u201cSam has already proven his Love for our Country, being horrifically wounded, and making the Comeback of a Lifetime,\u201d the former president wrote. \u201cSam Brown has my Complete and Total Endorsement - HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!\u201d Asked by CNN earlier Sunday whether he expected an endorsement, Brown \u2014 who was at the rally handing out water \u2014 said, \u201cI\u2019m just focused on getting through Tuesday. President Trump\u2019s got a lot on his plate too. I just know that coming through Tuesday, we\u2019re all going to be focused on November 5.\u201d In April, Trump posted on social media that Brown and the former president were the \u201cClear Choices of Nevada\u2019s Republican Voters and Donors.\u201d But Trump loyalists have bashed Brown for his ties to mainstream Republicans \u2013 he was personally recruited to run by Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm. Instead, they have encouraged the former president to back Jeff Gunter, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Iceland. Ahern, who hosted the event at his luxury boutique hotel, backed Brown when he unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for the state\u2019s other Senate seat in 2022. But Ahern has thrown his support behind Gunter this cycle and has encouraged Trump to do the same. Dangerous conditions Trump\u2019s campaign, which has been holding outdoor rallies more frequently in recent months, was bracing for extreme heat on Sunday as temperatures were expected to reach 104 degrees Fahrenheit. In preparation, the Trump campaign doubled the amount of emergency medical staff on site for the rally, added new misting fans and significantly increased the amount of water available to attendees, according to a Trump campaign official. The official said the campaign would provide more than 38,000 bottles of water, 20 Power Breezer misting fans throughout the venue in Sunset Park in Las Vegas, at least one cooling tent with air conditioning and pop-up umbrella tents throughout the space. More metal detectors were also expected to be added to help expedite security lines. The new precautions came after 12 people were transported to the hospital from Trump\u2019s campaign event in Phoenix due to heat-related illness, a spokeswoman for the Phoenix Fire Department told CNN. This story has been updated with Trump\u2019s endorsement of Sam Brown.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_trump-probation-office-interview-hush-money", "text": "Former President Donald Trump completed his pre-sentencing interview with the New York City Department of Probation on Monday after his\u00a0hush money trial\u00a0conviction last month, a source familiar with the proceedings told CNN. \u201cEarlier today, President Trump completed a routine interview with [the] New York Probation Office. The interview was uneventful and lasted less than thirty minutes,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cThe President and his team will continue to fight the lawless Manhattan DA Witch Hunt.\u201d The interview took place around 3:30 p.m. Monday, a second source told CNN. Trump answered all questions in the virtual interview and was described as polite, respectful and accommodating to the probation officers, according to a New York City official familiar with the interview. Juanita Holmes, commissioner for the New York City Department of Probation, was present, along with the general counsel for the department and the officer assigned to Trump\u2019s case, the source said. Trump attorney Todd Blanche was also present for the meeting. It is not standard for anyone other than the assigned officer and the defendant to be present at pre-sentencing interviews. Trump, according to the source, told the officers to be safe at the end of the interview. The probation department did not rule out the possibility of a follow-up meeting, the source added. The meeting forms part of the report the probation department will submit to Judge Juan Merchan to help decide Trump\u2019s punishment ahead of his sentencing, set for\u00a010 a.m.\u00a0on\u00a0July 11. Merchan could sentence the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. In a pre-sentencing interview, a defendant is typically asked about their conviction and other basic background information such as their employment and criminal history. Defendants do not have to cooperate with the routine pre-sentencing investigation, but a judge can take a negative inference from a defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation. As part of the process, Trump\u2019s legal team can submit letters of support from his friends and family to Merchan. The former president\u2019s team is scheduled to submit its sentencing recommendation Thursday, according to a source familiar with the plan. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office will also submit a memo telling the judge what sentence it sees fit for Trump. A Manhattan jury last month found Trump guilty of all 34 charges in his hush money trial, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. He was accused of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_border-biden-trump-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is pulling from former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration playbook as he tries to stop a flow of asylum-seekers from around the world who are crossing into the US at the border with Mexico. Unveiled at the White House on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s new plan to all but shut down the US border to asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally uses executive authority Trump once used to bar people from mostly-Muslim countries from entering the US in 2017 and also to bar most asylum-seekers in 2018 \u2013 days after Republicans suffered huge setbacks in midterm elections that year. It\u2019s an odd, election-year twist, since Biden actually ran his 2020 campaign in part on a promise to revoke those actions, which he did in the months after taking office. Trump\u2019s asylum policy was also blocked by federal courts before Biden revoked it. In addition to slowing the flow of asylum-seekers, Biden\u2019s action could have the political effect of chipping away at Trump\u2019s lead on the immigration issue and triangulating some middle-ground support, even if it leaves progressives angry. Read the full story on Biden\u2019s announcement from CNN\u2019s White House team. Trump and Biden remain very far apart It\u2019s still very true that their rhetoric on immigrants remains very different. Biden expresses openness to immigrants as an important segment of American society. He wants to protect the children of undocumented immigrants who have grown up in the US and to create a pathway to citizenship for those already here. Trump routinely employs over-the-top rhetoric to demonize migrants and asylum-seekers as being from a criminal class or part of a coordinated invasion of the US, although there\u2019s no evidence to support those claims. Trump has promised a militaristic approach to the border and a massive deportation program if he\u2019s elected in November. Biden, meanwhile, has been pivoting to the middle on immigration all year. The decision to invoke executive authority comes months after a bipartisan border proposal in Congress failed to yield a new permanent law to reform the asylum process. Republican lawmakers, bowing to Trump, refused to work with the White House. Trump had said he wanted to run on the issue of immigration in this election year. Announcing the new action at the White House, Biden said he was trying \u201cto do what the Republicans in Congress refused to do.\u201d Even if he\u2019s adopting the authority behind Trump\u2019s policy, he promised not to adopt Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country,\u201d Biden said at the White House. Biden argued that exceptions in his action make it more humane than Trump\u2019s proposals. Asylum-seekers can still try to make an appointment with border officials and seek asylum at a port of entry. Expect challenges The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged Trump\u2019s border actions when he was president, now plans to challenge Biden. \u201cIt was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,\u201d Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement. But today\u2019s Supreme Court, which has a majority of conservative appointees, could be more friendly to Biden\u2019s action. Border crossings are actually down CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores reported from Hidalgo, Texas, on Tuesday and noted the decline in crossings. Whereas last December, there were around 250,000 border apprehensions, figures in recent months are less than 140,000, and Flores reported the figures dropped even further in May. The Biden plan would bar migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met, with some exemptions. The measure would stay in place until encounters drop below an average of 1,500 per day. Officials in Hidalgo County told Flores that any measures to address the influx of asylum-seekers would need to take into account the cross-border traffic that generates economic activity in the area. A top official in Hidalgo County, Judge Richard Cortez, told Flores that Biden\u2019s action, while welcome, was a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d and not a permanent solution. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform remains the sole solution and Congress remains the sole venue to achieve this reform,\u201d Cortez said in a statement to Flores. Flores described her interviews with women who became victims of sexual violence while waiting on the Mexico side of the border for asylum claims to be processed and pointed to the vulnerable position today\u2019s action could force migrants into if they wait on the Mexico side of the border. Why now? CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, reporting from the White House, said part of the administration\u2019s calculus had been to wait until after Mexico\u2019s presidential election, which took place over the weekend, to announce this new action. Americans\u2019 ability to cut border crossings will rest, she said, in part on Mexico\u2019s ability to stop the flow of asylum-seekers within its borders. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our Mexican neighbors instead of attacking Mexico,\u201d Biden said at the White House, drawing a distinction between his approach and Trump\u2019s. Biden said he spoke with Mexico\u2019s president-elect on Monday. Trump holds an advantage on immigration CNN\u2019s Harry Enten notes that in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration has taken on increasing importance in the minds of voters. Troubling for Biden is that Trump is favored by 27 percentage points on the issue, according to polling from CNBC. Watch more from Enten: Long-standing authority Presidents have been using the authority to act on the border for decades; it is based in a 1950s immigration law. Here\u2019s the specific language: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The authority has routinely been used, according to the Congressional Research Service, by all recent presidents to restrict entry to the US for specific groups of people, like Europeans at one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, suspected terrorists or officials from countries like Iran. A fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security outlines the specific changes in how noncitizens will be processed at the border. People apprehended and slated for expedited removal would need to express fear of returning to their home country in order to be interviewed about their situation. Otherwise, they will quickly be returned to either Mexico or their home country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/border-biden-trump-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}

And that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking the world to call upon Hamas to accept,\u201d Sullivan added. His comments come after the Israeli military on Saturday rescued four hostages in a special operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, that Gazan authorities said killed 274 people and injured nearly 700 others. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. The IDF has disputed those numbers, saying it estimated the number of casualties from the operation was \u201cunder 100.\u201d \u201cInnocent people were tragically killed in this operation. The exact number, we don\u2019t know, but innocent people were killed and that is heartbreaking. That is tragic,\u201d Sullivan said Sunday. \u201cThe president himself has said in recent days that the Palestinian people are going through sheer hell in this conflict because Hamas is operating in a way that puts them in the crossfire, that holds hostages right in the heart of crowded civilian areas,\u201d he added. Pressed by Bash on whether the US was comfortable with how the mission was carried out, Sullivan called for a diplomatic solution \u201cwhere there\u2019s no need for military operations to get every last hostage out.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, we are going to continue to see ongoing conflict and military operations in which Israel makes efforts to recover its citizens and, frankly, to recover American citizens. What we would much prefer to see is a ceasefire where the hostages come out peacefully,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has been pushing\u00a0allies in the\u00a0Middle East\u00a0to make specific threats to Hamas as part of an urgent campaign to push the group toward accepting the latest\u00a0Israeli ceasefire and hostage proposal\u00a0that would pause the fighting in Gaza. US officials have publicly called on\u00a0the group\u00a0to accept previous\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0proposals on the table as Israel and Hamas\u00a0have engaged\u00a0in months of back-and-forth negotiations, but\u00a0there has never been an all-out\u00a0pressure campaign marked by specific asks to individual countries\u00a0as part of\u00a0the Biden administration\u2019s push. While the US has not confirmed Hamas\u2019 claims that other Israeli hostages held inside Gaza were killed during the mission, Sullivan said broadly that it is \u201calways a risk,\u201d going on to advocate for the ceasefire deal Biden has been lobbying for in recent days. This story has been updated with additional information Sunday. CNN\u2019s Sam Simpson contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_us-border-crossings-biden-dg", "text": "A new Biden administration policy that aims to address illegal southern US border crossings would have been in effect for at least the last three years because of a surge in migrant encounters, a CNN data analysis shows. The executive action, announced on Tuesday, bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum \u2014 with some limited exceptions \u2014 if the number of encountered by border agents exceeds a daily average of 2,500. Instead, they would be turned away immediately. The average daily illegal crossings have for years surpassed that threshold, peaking at over 8,000 in December, according to Department of Homeland Security data analyzed by CNN. The surge driving those record-breaking crossings reflects a worldwide rise in migration over the last five years, driven by factors such as\u00a0the uneven economic recovery from the pandemic and climate change, according to Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Under a pandemic-era restriction, which was lifted last year, federal authorities swiftly expelled hundreds of thousands of migrants encountered at the US southern border. A CNN analysis found the last time average daily encounters between migrants and US Border Patrol at the southwestern land border were less than 2,500 was in January 2021. The analysis of publicly accessible records on a federal website did not include encounters at southern coastal ports, which are also covered by the policy. To lift the new policy, the daily average needs to drop even lower \u2014 to less than 1,500 average daily encounters for seven consecutive days between ports of entry. The last time illegal crossings at the southwestern land border were that low was in July 2020, the records show. Before 2019, daily averages close to or below 1,500 at the southern border weren\u2019t uncommon. From 2014 through 2018, only nine months saw more than 45,000 encounters between US Border Patrol and migrants at the southwestern land border. Since 2019, however, only 11 months \u2014 mostly during\u00a0the height of the pandemic from September 2019 to July 2020 \u2014 had\u00a0fewer than 45,000 encounters. Border restrictions intended to stem the spread of Covid-19 in 2020 may have affected the number of crossings. The main reason for the rise over the last half-decade is a worldwide increase in migration, Putzel-Kavanaugh said. After Covid-19 travel restrictions were eased, recovery was uneven among countries. In some places, public resources, goods and employment remained unavailable longer after the worst of the pandemic. Elsewhere, crises created by climate change or war caused more people to emigrate. The result has been a surge in migration from more countries. \u201cThe goal of this rule seems to be to carry out more deportations in a quicker way,\u201d Kavanaugh-Putzel said. Under the new executive action, if migrants do state a fear after crossing illegally, they can receive an interview with an asylum officer, but the threshold they must meet is much higher. Border agents also no longer have to ask migrants if they have a fear under the new guidance, leaving it to migrants to express fear of return to their home country which, attorneys and advocates have said, is not always known to them. It\u2019s too early to know the policy\u2019s impact. The number of encounters between ports of entry has been declining every month since January but remains high, Putzel-Kavanaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that now that this rule is in place, we will likely see a decrease in border arrivals,\u201d she said. However, these policies often create a \u201cwait and see\u201d effect, where crossings rise again once the true impact of the policy is more widely understood.

{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_hunter-biden-trial-case-news", "text": "As the second week of the federal gun trial against Hunter Biden begins Monday, the main question looming over the day\u2019s proceedings is whether the defense will call the president\u2019s son to testify, a gamble in almost any trial. \u201cWe are down to that last decision,\u201d defense attorney Abbe Lowell told the judge Friday. Biden has been charged with three counts related to his purchase of a snubnosed revolver in 2018, which prosecutors say violated federal law because he was addicted to crack cocaine at the time. He has pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys have focused on the month Biden purchased the weapon, arguing that there is no direct evidence he was using drugs then. Prosecutors, citing witness testimony, text messages, images and Biden\u2019s own memoir, say the addiction at the time was well documented and that Biden knew he was an addict. One woman, who said she met Biden at the gentlemen\u2019s club where she worked, testified she saw him using drugs in September 2018, the month before the gun purchase. Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who later dated his brother Hunter, told the jury she saw what she believed was drug residue in Hunter Biden\u2019s truck, where she says she found the pistol days after others testified he bought the gun in October. Hunter Biden\u2019s daughter Naomi Biden testified on Friday, saying he looked well in August 2018 and\u00a0she was \u201chopeful\u201d about her father\u2019s recovery in October 2018. But on cross examination, prosecutors introduced texts between the two in late October where Naomi wrote her father: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, dad, I can\u2019t take this.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, I just miss you so much,\u201d the texts said. What\u2019s next Before breaking early Friday afternoon, Lowell told Judge Maryellen Noreika\u00a0that the defense had yet to decide whether Hunter Biden would testify \u2014 a decision they are set to announce Monday. Lowell has previously said that whether Biden saw himself as an addict when he purchased the firearm is crucial to the prosecution\u2019s case. If Biden does testify, prosecutors say they may put on a rebuttal case with more witnesses, which could extend the trial further into the week. Both sides will then present closing statements, summarizing their view of the case while highlighting supporting evidence. After the judge decides how the members of the jury will be instructed as to the law in the case \u2014 and what they must find to render a verdict \u2014 she will read those instructions and the 12 Delaware citizens will begin deliberations. There\u2019s no set time for how long a jury can deliberate, and any decision must be unanimous. If the jury is unable to reach a decision over each of the charges, a mistrial could be declared by the judge. If the jurors reach a verdict, the foreperson they selected will read the verdict aloud in the courtroom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/politics/hunter-biden-trial-case-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_biden-age-wall-street-journal-report-analysis", "text": "It\u2019s the recurring threat President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid will never be able to fully outrun. The White House was forced into a fresh damage control effort Wednesday to defend the 81-year-old commander in chief\u2019s acuity as he embarked on a grueling foreign trip and as the race gets nastier by the day. The latest episode was sparked by a Wall Street Journal article that cited descriptions \u2013 disputed by the White House \u2013 of the president\u2019s state of mind and fitness from what it described as more than 45 interviews with both Democrats and Republicans. The president was depicted as speaking so softly in one meeting about Ukraine that he was almost unintelligible to some participants. Other sources questioned whether he was fully in command of key details of his own policies. Democrats accused Republicans quoted or referred to in the account of making false claims and contradicting previous statements to damage Biden politically. Washington Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, complained on X that her comments to the Journal about the president\u2019s strong engagement in a meeting on Ukraine in January were not used by the paper. Biden has managed to tamp down previous kerfuffles over his age and capabilities this year with a robust public performance at his State of the Union address in March. He so surpassed Republican expectations that some in the party absurdly flipped from portraying him as doddering and incompetent to suggesting he must be drugged up. But all it takes is one halting on-camera moment or media report to revive the frenzy over Biden\u2019s age. This was inevitable as soon as the president decided to run for a second term that would begin when he is 82 and would end when he\u2019s 86. Biden\u2019s team habitually dismisses any concern over his capacity, and his doctors have certified him fit for duty. Democrats often claim this is an issue hyped up by the media, while pointing out that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump isn\u2019t young either \u2013 he turns 78 next week. This particular Wall Street Journal article may be a Beltway drama that isn\u2019t occupying the minds of most voters. But they are concerned about Biden\u2019s age. And the question of the president\u2019s fitness for office is a legitimate one even if Republican efforts to portray him as weak and incoherent have obvious political motivations. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll in February, for instance, 86% of Americans thought Biden was too old to serve another term. That included 59% of Americans who thought both he and Trump were too old and 27% who thought only Biden was too old. Voters can also see it for themselves. The president has clearly slowed in office. He does often speak quietly and mangle his words more than he did even as a gaffe-prone senator and vice president. The job of commander in chief is one of the most exacting in the world, involves constant life-and-death decisions and comes with no genuine days off. Public speculation about the capacity of the president is also a highly sensitive issue \u2014 and is often indulged in by pundits with no medical expertise. Millions of Americans have some familiarity with the indignities of aging. That may offer Biden some sympathy, but it\u2019s also a reason why many have concerns about an octogenarian serving as commander in chief. Biden defiant about his capabilities Biden \u2014 who was one of the youngest senators in US history and is now its oldest sitting president \u2014 bristles when asked whether he\u2019s too old to be president, or would be late in his second term when he\u2019d reach his mid 80s. \u201cI can do it better than anybody you know.\u00a0You\u2019re looking at me, I can take you too,\u201d Biden quipped to a reporter in a recent Time Magazine interview. \u201cWatch me. Look, name me a president that\u2019s gotten as much done as I\u2019ve gotten done in my first three and a half years.\u201d Massimo Calabresi, Time\u2019s Washington bureau chief, said that during their meeting, Biden came across \u201cvery much as he appears on TV,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is older than when he started in office. It\u2019s visible if you just look side by side on the tape.\u201d In his story, Calabresi wrote: \u201cThe President, with his stiff gait, muffled voice, and fitful syntax, cut a striking contrast with the intense, loquacious figure who served as Senator and Vice President.\u201d The debate over Biden\u2019s age is rendered more complex since he\u2019s running against a 77-year-old. Trump might come across as more energetic than his successor, whom he\u2019s dubbed \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d but the former president himself often appeared to be snoozing during his criminal trial in New York. The campaign trail version of Trump raises other concerns \u2014 not least because of his volcanic demeanor and estrangement from the truth. But Trump, like Biden, has recently bungled names, misidentified people and offered nonsensical public comments. Asked about the Wall Street Journal report by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump on Wednesday said, \u201cWe have a chance of going into World War III because of our leader. So I don\u2019t want to get into what state he\u2019s in,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not something for me to talk about.\u201d The former president went on to say Biden was not \u201cmentally sharp enough\u201d to do the job, before adding, \u201cand I don\u2019t believe he was 20 years ago, either.\u201d Fitness for office is often in the eye of the beholder. The Republicans who insist Biden is too diminished see no reason why a twice-impeached convicted felon who has echoed Nazi rhetoric and is promising to use presidential powers in a personal quest for \u201cretribution\u201d against his enemies should not return to the Oval Office. Biden is increasingly focusing on Trump\u2019s mental capacity. He has told audiences in fundraising events recently that \u201csomething snapped\u201d after Trump lost the 2020 election and that he\u2019s \u201cclearly unhinged.\u201d Has Biden slowed or is he \u2018savvy and effective\u2019? The Journal article, headlined \u201cBehind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,\u201d detailed anecdotes about the president\u2019s attentiveness in meetings. It said that Democrats and Republicans reported that he has slowed and that some of his engagement and energy fluctuated and that he had good days and bad days. The Journal noted, however, that most of those who were critical of Biden\u2019s performance were Republicans. The paper quoted former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not the same person.\u201d Current House Speaker Mike Johnson worried the president\u2019s memory \u201chad slipped about the details of his own policy,\u201d the Journal wrote, citing six people who had been told about the speaker\u2019s views. (The White House denied Biden had misspoken during that exchange.) Neither speaker is a disinterested observer. Both have vested political interests in playing into Trump\u2019s claims that Biden is too old or absent to serve. The White House responded to the Journal story by saying in a statement that \u201cCongressional Republicans, foreign leaders and nonpartisan national-security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment.\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates added: \u201cNow, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.\u201d There is no current public evidence that Biden is unable to carry out the most onerous duties of his job that include making vital decisions to ensure the country\u2019s national security, especially in emergencies and at times of crisis. Still, the public facing part of the presidency is also important. A fair-minded person cannot help but note that Biden is not the same dynamic room-filling force that he was for years. The break that Biden and his aides enjoyed from questions about his age after his barnstorming State of the Union address followed a previous age-related frenzy. Special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s February report into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents described him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and a transcript of the encounter showed Biden occasionally flustered and searching for dates. But the totality of the encounter doesn\u2019t support Republican claims of advanced cognitive decline. The report, however, was followed by a disastrous press appearance that served more to highlight questions of age than dampen them. \u201cI know what the Hell I am doing,\u201d the president said. But at one point, he compounded his problem when he meant to talk about the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said \u201cthe president of Mexico.\u201d On other occasions in February, Biden twice referred to dead European leaders \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl \u2013 when referring to conversations with their modern-day counterparts. Biden\u2019s stamina will be tested in the long haul to November\u2019s election. In the coming weeks, he has the kind of schedule that would exhaust anyone. He\u2019s due to return from France on Sunday, and is expected to fly to California for fundraising, before crossing the Atlantic again for the G7 summit in Italy next weekend. Even for someone with their own plane, it\u2019s a heavy lift at 81. Then he faces the most critical phase in his reelection campaign so far: his June 27 debate with Trump on CNN, which represents the most high-profile test of a sitting president\u2019s capabilities on live television since a much younger Ronald Reagan confronted similar questions in his 1984 reelection race. Presidents have great power. But even they cannot turn back the ravages of time. So it will not be long before Biden is once again called on to insist that he\u2019s not too old to serve. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_biden-aisne-marne-cemetery-france-visit", "text": "President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0is set to visit the American cemetery outside Paris honoring World War I dead on Sunday, setting up a contrast with former President Donald Trump, who skipped a visit to the cemetery during a 2018 trip. Biden will cap off a five-day trip to France paying his respects with a wreath-laying at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial before returning to Washington. He has spent much of the trip honoring American veterans \u2013 but the subtext of Sunday\u2019s expedition is also aimed at Trump,\u00a0who\u00a0scrapped his 2018 journey to the memorial\u00a0and later faced criticism for denigrating US veterans. Trump, who was in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I with other world leaders, blamed weather and safety issues for eschewing the cemetery visit. The president\u2019s Marine One helicopter cannot fly in low cloud cover, a decision that is made by military and security officials. But there did not appear to be a backup plan, and Trump did not make any statements of regret over not being able to visit the cemetery. CNN later reported that Trump referred to the fallen US service members\u00a0at Aisne-Marne in crude and derogatory terms. A former senior Trump administration official, who declined to be named, confirmed\u00a0reporting from\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0magazine, which\u00a0cited\u00a0sources who said Trump rejected the idea of a cemetery visit and proceeded to refer to the fallen soldiers as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d Trump has forcefully denied\u00a0the report in The Atlantic. His former chief of staff, John Kelly, later confirmed to CNN\u00a0several anecdotes in The Atlantic\u2019s story, including the cemetery visit and comments about\u00a0US soldiers killed in battle. Biden has repeatedly seized on those comments on the campaign trail. As he memorialized war heroes in Normandy on the\u00a080th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day\u00a0last week, his reelection campaign released a new ad featuring veterans knocking Trump as unfit to serve. \u201cA good commander in chief is someone who gives a sh*t,\u201d Curtis Register, a Marine Corps veteran, says in the ad. Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita cast the repeatedly corroborated reports on the former president\u2019s comments as a \u201cfake and thoroughly debunked\u201d story, calling Biden\u2019s team \u201cdesperate.\u201d The Biden campaign is aiming to distinguish the president from his predecessor \u2013 and presumptive GOP presidential nominee \u2013 on defense.\u00a0Taking advantage of the backdrop of decorum during his visit to France, Biden pledged unwavering support for European allies, in contrast with Trump\u2019s noncommittal stance. Trump\u00a0has cast doubt\u00a0on future support for NATO, telling supporters this year\u00a0that if reelected, he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any member country that doesn\u2019t meet spending guidelines on defense. Biden also took his argument Friday to Pointe-du-Hoc, a site separating the Omaha and Utah beaches where American Army Rangers scaled steep cliffs to secure positions against the Germans\u00a0on D-Day.\u00a0The president said those men would want their modern-day fellow citizens to do their part to protect against autocrats. \u201cThey\u2019re asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up to aggression abroad and at home to be part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d he said at the same poignant site as a 1984 speech with similar themes by President Ronald Reagan. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent,\u201d Reagan said\u00a0in his address honoring the 40th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day. Trump also traveled to Normandy to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day \u2013 but attacked Democrats in an interview after his speech.

{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_biden-family-trial", "text": "As President Joe Biden engages in the fight of his political life in a campaign focused on democracy and the rule of law, the most intimate details of his family\u2019s ongoing personal tragedies have been publicly dissected in a courtroom over the last week. Hunter Biden\u2019s struggles with addiction after the death of\u00a0his brother\u00a0Beau Biden have been the focus of hours of testimony during his trial for federal criminal charges, putting some of the Biden family\u2019s most personal problems on full display. The president\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts connected to a gun he purchased in October 2018. For decades, the president has navigated the sometimes-competing demands of his political career and being a father, particularly when it comes to Hunter Biden.\u00a0Part of the president\u2019s enduring brand has been his ability to relate to the personal tragedies of others because of what his family has suffered, including the death of his first wife and daughter in a 1972 car crash that severely injured Beau and Hunter, and Beau\u2019s 2015 death from brain cancer. The effect Beau Biden\u2019s death had on his younger brother has been a focus\u00a0in court.\u00a0At issue in the case is whether Hunter Biden lied when he asserted he wasn\u2019t an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d drugs\u00a0on a form\u00a0when he purchased a revolver\u00a0in October 2018.\u00a0Jury deliberations began Monday afternoon. In the government\u2019s opening arguments, prosecutor Derek Hines argued \u201cno one is above the law\u201d regardless of their family name,\u00a0echoing the Biden campaign\u2019s\u00a0response to Trump\u2019s guilty verdict\u00a0last month. To convince the jury that Hunter Biden was actively using drugs around October 2018, prosecutors laid bare the broken relationships and desperate measures he took to access drugs, through testimony of people close to him and, at times, with his own words.\u00a0Prosecutors have also showed the laptop Hunter Biden left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019 \u2013 infamously at the center of many GOP attacks on the president and his son \u2013 and have used text messages pulled from the computer to make the case that Hunter was using drugs when he bought the gun. On the first day of testimony, prosecutors played clips from the audiobook recording of Hunter\u2019s 2021 memoir \u201cBeautiful Things.\u201d For nearly an hour, jurors, several of whom had lost loved ones to addiction, listened as Hunter described the depths of his addiction, from being ripped off by fellow drug addicts to roaming homeless encampments in Los Angeles to buy crack. The most emotional parts of the trial involved the testimony from those closest to Hunter Biden, including his daughter Naomi, his ex-girlfriend and his brother\u2019s widow Hallie Biden and his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle. Though the questions they faced were aimed at determining whether Hunter was using drugs in 2018, the effect Hunter\u2019s drug use had on their own lives was inescapable. On the third day of the trial, prosecutors called Buhle, who was married to Hunter for more than two decades until their divorce was finalized in 2017, to the stand. She testified about drugs and paraphernalia she found in Hunter\u2019s car multiple times, including in 2018, when she would check it before their daughters used the vehicle. Buhle, who was ordered to testify under a subpoena, told the court that she learned of Hunter Biden\u2019s drug use in 2015. He moved out of their home after she discovered a crack pipe, but the couple didn\u2019t officially separate until she learned of his infidelity. The two did not interact while she was in the courtroom. Hallie Biden, who was dating Hunter Biden at the time he bought the gun, was another key witness for the prosecution. The two grew close in the wake of Beau Biden\u2019s death and publicly announced their relationship in March 2017. President Biden said in a statement on behalf of himself and his wife that Hunter and Hallie had their \u201cfull and complete support and we are happy for them.\u201d Their complicated on-and-off again relationship is at the center of the charges. Hallie Biden took the gun Hunter Biden is accused of illegally possessing out of his car and tossed it in a dumpster near a Wilmington, Delaware, grocery store. She testified that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack in 2018 and she abused the drug until quitting in August 2018. She said that she encouraged him to get sober. \u201cIt was a terrible experience that I went through,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed, and I\u2019m ashamed and I regret that period of my life.\u201d Critically, she testified that on October 23, she found the gun and drugs as she cleaned out Hunter Biden\u2019s truck. Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, stressed the importance of his client\u2019s frame of mind when he made the purchase and whether he \u201cknowingly\u201d violated the law when he bought the gun. Lowell connected Hunter\u2019s addiction to the string of tragedies that have defined him and the family for decades, including the accident that killed his mother and sister. If Hallie Biden was the prosecution\u2019s star witness, the defense hoped that Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s daughter, would help blunt the impact of her testimony. Naomi Biden described a visit she took to see her father in the summer of 2018 while he was in rehab in Los Angeles after not seeing him \u201cin a really long time,\u201d she said. She brought her partner, now husband, to meet him. \u201cHe seemed like the clearest he had been since my uncle died,\u201d she told the court. \u201cHe seemed really great.\u201d Naomi Biden\u00a0also\u00a0testified that she didn\u2019t see evidence of drug use in her father\u2019s car when she borrowed it in October 2018. She said he seemed clear headed when they met up and she was \u201chopeful\u201d about his sobriety efforts. Prosecutors, however, confronted Naomi with a series of texts from the time, when Hunter Biden seemed difficult to reach. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry dad I can\u2019t take this,\u201d she texted her father, adding that she just wanted to \u201chang out with you.\u201d After her testimony, Naomi Biden was seen wiping away tears as she left the courtroom. For many, both inside and outside the courtroom, Hunter\u2019s struggles with addiction and the toll it has taken on the family were deeply familiar. Several of the jurors said they\u00a0knew people who had struggled with addiction. During jury selection, potential jurors grew emotional at times as they described relatives who had struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and tried to get sober.\u00a0One said her parents\u2019 alcohol addiction would help her understand Hunter\u2019s case better. Another, who prosecutors objected to, said his daughter is a recovering addict and \u201ceveryone deserves a second chance.\u201d Weathering adversity together has become part of the Biden brand. The president\u00a0has not shied away from supporting Hunter Biden\u00a0over the years, even as he\u2019s faced legal troubles over his taxes and the gun charges, or as House Republicans attempt to use his son\u2019s business dealings against him. That family support has been on full display in court, where he has been surrounded by family members: his stepmother, first lady Dr. Jill Biden; his sister Ashley Biden; his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden; his aunt, Valerie Biden; and various longtime family friends.\u00a0President Biden wasn\u2019t in the courtroom, but made clear where he stood as the trial began. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad,\u201d Biden said in a statement at the start of the trial. \u201cOur family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d Last week, the president ruled out pardoning his son.

{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_joe-biden-immigration-future-moves", "text": "Looking to shore up\u00a0Latino votes\u00a0in Nevada and Arizona for his reelection campaign, President Joe Biden is\u00a0on the verge of\u00a0soon following\u00a0up last week\u2019s executive action aimed at curbing border crossings with another\u00a0move\u00a0focused on providing legal status for long-term undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens. Though final details have not been decided, officials are reviewing an existing legal authority known as \u201cparole in place\u201d that\u00a0would shield select undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to work legally in the country as they seek citizenship.\u00a0The orders have not yet been presented to Biden himself for review. Polling reviewed by top aides in the White House and the president\u2019s reelection headquarters\u00a0are helping seal\u00a0the deal. For Biden in Arizona, \u201cEverything is on the margins, right?\u201d said Democratic Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. \u201cMy sense is it should help.\u201d Estimates put the number of people who could be directly affected at\u00a0750,000 to 800,000,\u00a0with a reverberating effect among spouses, children, extended family and friends \u2014 and predominantly Latinos. That\u2019s millions of potential votes in just Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia.\u00a0Those are\u00a0all battleground states, all home to many Latinos and all looking likely to be decided in November by slivers of the electorate. \u201cWe have lost the narrative on the border, and so we need to start winning it back,\u201d said one person involved in the discussions of why Biden started with the executive\u00a0action tightening\u00a0asylum rules last week. But \u201cLatino voters in particular are extremely enthusiastic about seeing something done to help people they know. It is either a direct relative or friend, someone they work with,\u201d that person argued. \u201cIt is such a powerful signal to these communities that you care about them, and you understand what\u2019s happening there.\u201d This could amount to the federal government\u2019s biggest relief program since the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\u00a0That program, which allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to live and work in the country, was announced\u00a0mid-June of Obama\u2019s own reelection year in 2012. Several veterans of Obama\u2019s reelection point to that moment as a key turning point for his bid for a second term. Biden, then\u00a0the\u00a0vice president, was engaged in many of those discussions. People involved with the internal discussions say that by focusing on workers and keeping families together, Biden would be able to make a case about economic growth, as well as asserting a very different portrayal of immigrants than that pushed by Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s campaign has also been looking to attract Latino voters, with the launch of a Latinos for Trump group timed to the former president\u2019s rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, among other outreach and advertising. Still, on Thursday night in Arizona, Trump brought onto stage and kissed former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, infamous for his crackdowns on undocumented immigrants and the recipient of a Trump presidential pardon for illegal racially profiling. Though some still think Biden may not go through with the move, aides have discussed when best to make the announcement. One option is to do so ahead of the June 27 debate, with the aim of goading Trump into attacking the widely popular orders. Some\u00a0worry, though, that giving Trump that opening could lead to voters turning against the border executive action\u00a0by calling the moves \u201camnesty.\u201d\u00a0Making the announcement later would deprive Trump of\u00a0that possibility, while giving Biden another attention bump, perhaps with a July 4\u00a0theme. Others say it\u00a0could\u00a0slip to later that month,\u00a0especially in a White House where internal deadlines are often missed. Kelly said that every week he hears from constituents facing problems stemming from their documentation status, but also from CEOs looking for more workers. He and his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, \u201cknow people that these policies affect and their families directly. I think that\u2019s true for most Arizonans,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s co-workers, it\u2019s a co-worker\u2019s relative, it\u2019s a friend, it\u2019s a family member.\u201d Support for \u2018an easy straightforward fix that most Americans think happens already\u2019 To tamp down criticism among many leading Latino and immigration advocacy groups\u00a0over\u00a0Biden\u2019s executive action\u00a0cracking down on border crossings, several operatives connected with the president spent days quietly reassuring leaders that more was coming. They urged those leaders not to risk either frustrating the West Wing or getting themselves too far out on a limb when circumstances may change. Then, on Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\u00a0kept the door open for more immigration moves\u00a0in a virtual briefing with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus, saying the administration is reviewing possible options to extend protections to long-term undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, according to a source familiar. Strategists working with the Biden campaign argue that the pair of moves \u2014 border security and legalization for long-term undocumented immigrants \u2014 will appeal to Latino voters who have drifted from Biden, citing polling that shows Latinos also favor border enforcement. And not just among immigrants, or among Latinos. Across Democrats, Republican and independents and across backgrounds,\u00a0Biden aides believe there is close to universal support for keeping families together by creating pathways to citizenship for immigrants who have been living in the US.for many years and pass a background check and pay taxes, according to a memo obtained by CNN summarizing one set of findings shared with the White House and the Biden campaign. Those numbers also show huge support for expanding work permits to Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for many years and passed background checks\u00a0and who don\u2019t have criminal records. Other polling that Biden\u2019s campaign\u00a0has\u00a0seen shows similar levels of support. Biden not so subtly teased the move himself as he announced the border action on Tuesday, acknowledging the blowback by some immigrant advocates and progressives who blasted his asylum restrictions. Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal told CNN that she felt Biden had \u201cgone into the same frame as Donald Trump at the very time when we need to make a distinction between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\u201d \u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you \u2014 be patient,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn the weeks ahead \u2014 and I mean the\u00a0weeks\u00a0ahead \u2014 I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.\u201d Democeratic Rep. Tom Suozzi\u00a0was hailed by many in his party as a national example when he won back his old New York City suburbs House seat in a February special election by successfully pushing back on Republican attacks centered on immigration and the situation at the border. He\u00a0told CNN after standing with Biden at the White House that he has already written a letter to the president asking for the next move. Suozzi argued that so many people believe that citizenship automatically comes from marrying an American that actually providing documentation to people in otherwise-citizen families would be \u201can easy straightforward fix that most Americans think happens already and most Americans would support.\u201d \u201cIt\u00a0would be great for the economy, it would be great for the families, and it would be great for America,\u201d Suozzi said. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who also flew to Washington to stand with Biden at the White House on Tuesday, said the new moves on the border are extremely important \u2014 and that the next steps also will be\u00a0key\u00a0to voters in her state and across the Southwest come November. \u201cVoters want a fair president who understands their struggles, who\u2019s willing to make tough decisions, who\u2019s clear that he can\u2019t do all of it, but tries to balance those efforts leaning toward the public safety realities where he must,\u201d Lujan Grisham said.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s more coming \u2014 and it\u2019s a valve. It uses smart, effective policies where you need them right now. He gets both.\u201d White House spokesman Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez declined to address specifics, but told CNN, \u201cAs\u00a0we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\u201d Immigration advocates debate wider action As the panic among Biden aides about the drop-off in Latino support has been mounting around the reelection campaign, pressure for more policy moves from Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocacy groups has been\u00a0growing\u00a0for months. In May, a group of Democratic senators including Sens. Alex Padilla of California, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada publicly called for protections to be extended to long-term undocumented immigrants in the United States, including the spouses of American citizens and their caregivers. Padilla said Biden\u2019s actions on the border from Tuesday were a huge disappointment. \u201cThis is the first time that I can recall that a Democratic position is, \u2018OK, let\u2019s be all for the border and not fight for relief \u2014 for DREAMers, for farmers, or anyone who\u2019s a long-term resident of the United States who happens to be undocumented,\u201d Padilla told CNN after Tuesday\u2019s announcement. Now Biden shouldn\u2019t wait to make the additional moves, Padilla argued. \u201cIf they were going to take a tough-on-the-border action, they should have paired it with something as thoughtful and responsible \u2014 and overdue,\u201d Padilla said. Advocates who have long been pushing for the moves that are about to be put in front of Biden are now stressing the potential political benefits themselves. \u201cAs we approach the 12th anniversary of the DACA program, President Obama\u2019s decision to take bold executive action to support our nation\u2019s Dreamers remains a masterstroke of political ingenuity and the most successful immigration policy in decades,\u201d said Todd Schulte, president of\u00a0FWD.us, in a statement.\u00a0\u201cToday, President Biden faces a similar pivotal moment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/politics/joe-biden-immigration-future-moves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_va-job-cuts-frontline-worker-invs", "text": "US Department of Veterans Affairs officials have eliminated frontline jobs for staffers who provide care to veterans,\u00a0even though agency leaders previously declared such positions would largely be protected from cuts,\u00a0according to a CNN review of documents and interviews with more than 20 VA employees and job applicants. Positions for psychologists, clinical social workers and others have been cut, and some job offers have been rescinded in recent weeks and months as the agency seeks to address a budgetary shortfall and shave its workforce by 10,000 positions. The job reductions come at a time when some veterans continue to face extended wait times for service and as suicides among veterans remain disproportionately high. The cuts have rankled rank-and-file VA employees as their department has been embroiled in a scandal for improperly awarding about $11 million in bonuses to senior VA executives last year, as detailed in a May inspector general report. VA Secretary Denis McDonough said the VA canceled the bonuses and began recouping them after realizing the error. The eliminations follow a surge in VA hiring. The agency added tens of thousands of staffers to its ranks last year to keep pace with an increase in veterans seeking care, but VA insiders now fear the job eliminations \u2014 especially those involving frontline positions \u2014 could undercut their health system. In recent weeks, lawmakers have requested information from the VA about its job reduction strategy after hearing reports that jobs that provide direct care for veterans have been targeted. CNN has confirmed with VA staffers and prospective hires that offers for such positions have been rescinded. VA Under Secretary for Health Dr. Shereef Elnahal issued internal memos in late May directing managers to continue hiring for roles vital to patient safety and to quality and timeliness of care. He also said certain key positions geared toward suicide prevention, homelessness and women\u2019s health that had been frozen should be reactivated and filled. Elnahal did, however, say administrative roles and certain clinical positions \u2014 such as those that could be accomplished by other employees \u2014 could be cut. It remains unclear how many frontline positions that were on the chopping block could be reinstated following Elnahal\u2019s updated guidance, and whether applicants who had offers rescinded would be offered the jobs again. VA spokesperson Terrence Hayes told CNN in a statement that while the VA continues to strategically hire in key areas, such as mental health and in locations with spikes in veterans seeking care, the agency has \u201cthe nationwide staffing total we need to deliver for our nation\u2019s Veterans.\u201d Hayes said that local VA leaders have authority to make decisions about the staff they hire. \u201cThere are no plans for an enterprise-wide hiring freeze or layoffs,\u201d he said, noting that the VA has onboarded thousands of mental health professionals over the last three years. Recently, local VA managers have been issuing internal warnings about hiring. \u201cThe recent VA strategic hiring initiative has placed considerable strain on all our services and disciplines across our facility, both clinical and non-clinical,\u201d wrote Dr. Mark Kadowaki, the chief of staff for the VA medical center in Iron Mountain, Michigan, in a May email to staff obtained by CNN. VA spokesperson Hayes said the Iron Mountain medical center has had a net increase in employees this year and has added specialty providers. The staffing shakeup has also triggered backlash on Capitol Hill. In April, the top two senators on the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs called the staff reduction plan a \u201cmess.\u201d A separate group of senators requested language in a bill that would direct the VA to share details on employee vacancies, positions cut, and how those could affect care. \u201cInconsistent staffing patterns put veterans\u2019 healthcare quality and accessibility at risk,\u201d the senators wrote in a letter. Dr. Harold Kudler, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Duke University who has four decades of experience serving veterans through the VA, questioned the decision to rescind offers for frontline positions and said, \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. If you remove access to expert care \u2014 if you remove access to the largest suicide prevention program in the country, if not the world \u2014 then that\u2019s not good for veterans.\u201d Kudler and others expressed particular concern about cuts involving mental health care. A Government Accountability Office report in February noted that veterans suffer a disproportionately high rate of suicide, with an average of almost 18 veterans dying daily by suicide in 2021, about 72% greater than the general adult population. Job offers axed The plan to downsize comes after the VA went on a hiring spree last year amid an increase in veterans seeking care. In 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits for veterans exposed to various toxic substances.\u00a0More veterans enrolled for VA care and the department\u2019s health administration hired more than 60,000 employees in fiscal year 2023, which swelled the VA\u2019s ranks to more than 400,000 total staffers.\u00a0\u00a0 But a budgetary shortfall has led the department to make reductions, officials say. Elnahal said at a news conference in March that he believed the VA could eliminate up to 10,000 positions through \u201cattrition and voluntary separation,\u201d without compromising care for veterans. He said such cuts would primarily focus on positions that were \u201cmore managerial, programmatic individuals, supervisory roles that aren\u2019t necessarily over the point of care directly.\u201d But multiple VA sources told CNN that reductions have seemed less strategic than Elnahal promised. And they have accused the department of slow-walking hires for positions they called critical. \u201cIt\u2019s actually direct-care staff that\u2019s being eliminated,\u201d said Tiffany Roman of Pueblo, Colorado, a VA nurse who works as the vice president of a local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees union. In an April email shared by another source, a VA manager in Central Texas, Stacy Ritz, told local staffers that 22 vacant positions related to mental health and behavioral medicine had been \u201cabolished,\u201d meaning the jobs were no longer \u201con the books.\u201d Ritz wrote that her team could \u201cask for them back when the financial situation is more optimistic,\u201d though she described the losses as \u201cpainful.\u201d VA spokesperson Hayes said those abolished positions had been vacant for half a year and that local leadership can refill them if needed. He said the Central Texas VA has increased mental health staffing in the last three years. Some VA staffers have questioned the logic behind many of the cuts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like they are assessing clinical needs,\u201d said Chris Mapps, president of a local AFGE union chapter in Michigan and a VA advanced medical support assistant. \u201cIt seems to be based on them telling the facilities, \u2018These are your numbers you got to hit.\u2019\u201d William Hazel, a clinical social worker who has worked for the federal government for years, experienced one of the cuts. Hazel said that he applied last year for a VA social worker position based in the US territory of Guam, which he said lacks many of the mental healthcare resources available in parts of the US mainland. He hoped to help veterans overcome substance abuse and other challenges. After receiving a tentative job offer in September, Hazel said, he continued moving through the agency\u2019s onboarding process. In March, the government notified him that although he was an \u201cexceptional candidate,\u201d the offer had been rescinded due to \u201cbudgetary issues the Agency is experiencing and other unforeseen circumstances,\u201d according to an email he shared with CNN. Hazel told CNN he was disappointed. \u201cThey say that mental health is a critical element to them, yet we were cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe motto of the VA is to care for him who has borne the battle. Are they doing that? I respectfully submit, no.\u201d \u201cI feel like I have been betrayed and left out to dry,\u201d said another applicant who received a tentative job offer for a VA position researching suicide prevention that was rescinded in March after the applicant had moved to the state where the job was located. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still wants to work for the VA. Yet another applicant who had a tentative offer for a VA staff psychologist position rescinded in March \u2014 also \u201cdue to unforeseen circumstances,\u201d according to a government email \u2014 said the experience made her question the extent to which the VA truly prioritizes mental healthcare. She also spoke anonymously due to plans to reapply for VA jobs. Asked about the staffing cuts at a Senate hearing in May, VA Secretary McDonough said that the federal budget \u201cdoes force some choices\u201d on his department, though he said the agency\u2019s retention of employees had been at \u201chistoric highs\u201d and that it is \u201cbetter sourced with clinicians\u201d due to spikes in hiring in recent years. He also said the VA could continue to strategically fill positions based on clinical need. The VA has been touting in news releases that department surveys show trust in the VA has increased among veterans and that wait times for new patient appointments in primary and mental healthcare slightly decreased in April. Still, a Government Accountability Office report published this month found challenges with the VA\u2019s ability to provide timely care and noted that many VA facilities last year took more than two weeks to even schedule mental health appointments in the private sector, an option used when veterans have to wait too long or travel too far for VA care. The VA said in response to the report that it was seeking to improve the timely scheduling of such appointments. Some warn any momentum in improving VA care could be undercut by decisions to trim health workers. \u201cAny time you impact staffing, any time you lower the potential for one-on-one care, any time you lower the areas of need \u2014 mental health, primary care, surgeries \u2014 that always poses a risk,\u201d said Jeff Shapiro, the president of the VA council for the National Federation of Federal Employees union. \u201cIt\u2019s a managerial problem.\u201d CNN\u2019s Allison Gordon and Kyung Lah contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/va-job-cuts-frontline-worker-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to try to depict Democrats as the \u201ctrue radicals\u201d on abortion policy. To make his case, though, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made wildly inaccurate claims. In a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump said, \u201cHard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born. Killing a person after birth is illegal in every state. \u201cEvery state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no basis for this claim,\u201d Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: \u201cThe falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.\u201d There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified \u201cother places.\u201d But he was wrong then, too: New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though false social media posts claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator\u2019s 2022 bill that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was revised before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee acknowledged that the early text\u2019s vague use of the phrase \u201cperinatal death\u201d might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom clarified that the \u201cperinatal death\u201d immunity is specifically for \u201cperinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.\u201d In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the false claim that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: \u201cI say, let the states decide. This is \u2014 every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN.  \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d Maya Manian, an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned,\u00a0said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fascism-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "This week, Americans and Europeans celebrated the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces invaded occupied France, marking the beginning of the end of fascist power in Europe. Last week, after being found guilty of falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump said Americans today live in a \u201cfascist state,\u201d building on his unfounded conspiracy theory that somehow President Joe Biden is behind his prosecution in Manhattan. It was an ironic turn of phrase for Trump since, throughout his rise, academics and pundits have debated whether his cult-of-personality politics veers toward a form of fascism. But flipping the script on his critics is a specialty of the former president. Robert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University who has written widely on fascism in Europe, had rejected the label for Trump until January 6, 2021, when the historian argued that the image of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol \u201cremoves my objection to the fascist label.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of certain terms has forced comparisons The debate over whether Trump veers toward fascism was renewed multiple times this year after Trump\u2019s committed followers swatted away a field of qualified challengers for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has repeatedly used language that can be tied back to Nazis, such as when he said immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country. Last month, his campaign amplified and then deleted a supporter\u2019s video that promised a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins reelection. The New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat took a close look at all of the images presented in that video and concluded for CNN Opinion that the video was \u201creminiscent of the fascist propaganda I have studied for\u00a0many years.\u201d With a charismatic leader, a nationalist outlook built around fear of immigrants and a sense of grievance built around his 2020 election loss, there are certainly some ingredients of fascism in the current version of Trump\u2019s campaign. Supporters have a plan to use a second Trump term to gut portions of the civil service, supposedly to remake a government that will more easily bend to his will. His sense of persecution at facing criminal charges adds more grist. Trump has consistently teased the idea that he will repay his political rival, Biden, for his conviction. The Trump-supporting Fox News host Sean Hannity tried repeatedly on Wednesday to get Trump to rule out using the Department of Justice as an arm for vengeance, but Trump rambled around the questions. \u201cIt has to stop, because otherwise we\u2019re not going to have a country,\u201d Trump said, suggesting he would not weaponize the Justice Department. But he then said he would be fully within his rights to prosecute his political opponents.  \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president said. That\u2019s less definitive than the social media post last year when Trump verifiably promised, if he wins, to appoint a special counsel to \u201cgo after\u201d Biden, but it\u2019s certainly not a hard no. \u2018I don\u2019t care what you call this\u2019 When CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance about Trump\u2019s claim the US is a \u201cfascist state,\u201d Vance, who CNN has reported is being vetted as a potential Trump running mate, would not reject the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love,\u201d Vance said in a tense exchange. Watch it: A warning from McConnell There are comparisons between current times and the rise of fascism everywhere at the moment, even when they are not focused directly on Trump. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times commemorating D-Day titled, \u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the 1930s.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mention Trump. McConnell will step aside from his Senate GOP leadership position in November in part because his party has moved away from the arsenal-of-democracy view of American power embraced by McConnell and other old-school Republicans and toward an isolationist, Vladimir Putin-friendly view of foreign policy pushed by Trump. Arguing that we rightly celebrate D-Day soldiers, McConnell argued we often forget why those service members needed to fight in the first place. \u201cWe forget how influential isolationists persuaded millions of Americans that the fate of allies and partners mattered little to our own security and prosperity,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe gloss over the powerful political forces that downplayed growing danger, resisted providing assistance to allies and partners, and tried to limit America\u2019s ability to defend its national interests.\u201d I talked to Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and editor of the new book, \u201cDid It Happen Here? Perspectives on Fascism and America,\u201d which includes the writing of Paxton, among many others. \u201cThat model of historical comparison where we look to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and then use it as kind of a navigational device or a map for understanding what\u2019s happened today is quite common,\u201d he said, although there are arguments it is a flawed comparison. \u201cConcepts don\u2019t have timeless essences that we can just map on to any phenomena, but they change given political context, given power structures in society,\u201d he said. Today, he said, the term \u201cfascism\u201d is used \u201cto mobilize people in order to get over their divides, to defeat an enemy that\u2019s far greater than their own long-standing disputes.\u201d Steinmetz-Jenkins argued there is a long history, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, of Americans on both sides of the political aisle trying to label their opponents as \u201cfascist,\u201d and there are also examples of American lawmakers threatening their opponents with investigation. There are arguments in favor of the fascism comparison, but also arguments against it \u2013 particularly since there are echoes of Trump\u2019s rise in populist and White nationalist movements closer to home in American history. Directly comparing eras can backfire For instance, Rep. Byron Donalds, a Black Republican from Florida and another potential Trump running mate, has had to explain his argument that American social programs have driven Black families apart and that they were more cohesive at a time of legalized racial terror under Jim Crow laws in the US, which were a model for Nazis. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said in comments first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer. He tried to explain that comment to CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on Wednesday, arguing he was not expressing nostalgia for the Jim Crow era, but rather trying to argue that during that period, marriage rates were higher. It was a complicated argument for him to make, to say the least. Donalds tried to argue that the ideological divide in today\u2019s political parties should be applied to perceptions of that era, when some Southern Democrats opposed civil rights legislation and some Northern Republicans supported it. Today, the parties are even more regionally divided, with Democrats largely out of power in the South and Republicans largely out of power in the North. The parties realigned around conservative and liberal ideologies \u2013 a process that continues to happen today as Republicans reorient around Trumpism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fascism-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_mayorkas-biden-asylum-action", "text": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday pushed back on criticism of President Joe Biden\u2019s new executive action restricting asylum while calling on Congress to take action on the border. \u201cIt\u2019s early, the signs are positive. Our personnel have done an extraordinary job in implementing a very big shift in how we operate on the southern border,\u201d Mayorkas said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d noting that implementation of the new policy \u2014 announced last Tuesday \u2014 has only just begun. The executive action \u2014 which bars migrants crossing the border illegally from seeking asylum, with some limited exceptions, once an average daily threshold is met \u2014 marked the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border, which former President Donald Trump has made a central focus of his 2024 campaign. But the attacks on the new policy from both Republicans and progressive Democrats have underscored the precarious position Biden is in on immigration ahead of the November election. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, for example, accused Biden of \u201cgaslighting\u201d Americans on Sunday. \u201cPeople need to understand that what Biden has done, he\u2019s not doing anything to actually secure the border, in fact it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Abbott said on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d \u201cWhen he stops the asylum process, there\u2019s nothing that Biden is doing that actually is preventing anybody else from crossing the border. There\u2019s no type of enforcement mechanism in place.\u201d While the number of encounters between ports of entry is still high, it\u2019s too early to know the policy\u2019s impact. Still, Mayorkas insisted the restrictions on asylum would reduce the number of people who try to cross the border. \u201cOur intent is to really change the risk calculus of individuals before they leave their countries of origin and incentivize them to use the lawful pathways that we have made available to them and keep them out of the hands of exploitative smugglers,\u201d Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. The new policy would have been in effect for at least the last three years because of a surge in migrant encounters, a CNN data analysis shows. Pressed on why the administration did not act sooner once the bipartisan immigration deal fell apart\u00a0in February, Mayorkas pointed to the second attempt to advance the measure, which failed last month because of GOP opposition and Democratic divisions. \u201cThe bipartisan deal was rejected once, we pressed forward again. It was rejected a second time and then we developed this and have implemented it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re at an early stage, and let\u2019s not minimize the significance of this move and the significance of operationalizing it. And it requires the cooperation of other countries which we have secured.\u201d But Mayorkas again called on Congress to do more. \u201cWhat we need is congressional action. We cannot resource the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, the Department of Justice with additional personnel. We need Congress to legislate.\u201d In February, Senate Republicans blocked the\u00a0major bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package\u00a0amid a torrent of attacks on it from Trump and top House Republicans. Democrats revived the border measure in May in an effort to put pressure on Republicans and shift the narrative on border security, but the bill ended up exposing divides among Democrats and threatening to undermine the party\u2019s messaging effort. Biden\u2019s new measure has further exposed that division, with some progressives coming out against it and comparing it to Trump administration policies. Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally and co-chairman of his reelection campaign, tried to draw a distinction between the current and previous administrations\u2019 approaches. \u201cFormer President Trump tried to implement a Muslim ban, a ban on entry to this country explicitly based on one religion. He also used cruelty. The forceful separation of parents from their children and the caging of children at our border,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, pointing a finger at Trump for intervening to kill the deal in Congress. \u201cFormer President Trump actually wants a problem to solve through his election rather than a solution that a bipartisan group of senators stood behind,\u201d the Delaware Democrat said. Progressive House Democrats, however, called last week\u2019s executive action \u201ca step in the wrong direction\u201d and urged Biden to \u201creverse course.\u201d And the ACLU has said it intends to sue over the new action, which it likened to ones taken during the Trump administration. \u201cI respectfully disagree with the ACLU,\u201d Mayorkas said Sunday. \u201cI anticipate they will sue us. We stand by the legality of what we have done. It\u2019s not only a matter of securing the border, Martha, we have a humanitarian obligation to keep vulnerable people out of the hands of exploitative smugglers.\u201d CNN reported Sunday that Biden, looking to shore up Latino votes, is on the verge of\u00a0another\u00a0immigration move\u00a0\u2014 this one focused on providing legal status for long-term undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/politics/mayorkas-biden-asylum-action/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters", "text": "The way American campaigns are financed can be impenetrable even to people who pay close attention to politics. Campaigns can only get so much money directly from donors. More money flows to organizations that can\u2019t technically coordinate with campaigns but sure seem to come close. Separate organizations can also try to influence elections by pushing for issues, but they sure seem to try to benefit candidates. Add into that complicated mess the fact that former President Donald Trump has been paying his copious legal bills through the campaign finance system. To better understand what we know about how and by whom campaigns are being funded in 2024, I went to Fredreka Schouten, who covers this complicated issue for CNN. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below. WOLF: What are the broad strokes of what we know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: During the course of this campaign, the former president has asked his political donors to help pay his soaring legal bills. The primary vehicle has been a leadership PAC called Save America that Trump established after he lost the White House in November 2020. Trump seeded the PAC largely with money he raised in the aftermath of his loss when he asked for donors\u2019 help in fighting what he claimed was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. (Save America also transferred some of that money \u2013 $60 million \u2013 to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., that could directly spend money to help his campaign. More on that later.) As a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, Trump has consistently diverted a share of new political donations to Save America, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 to his legal expenses. For instance, a joint fundraising agreement among Trump, the Republican National Committee and a couple dozen state GOP committees\u00a0sends donations to Save America\u00a0before the national party and state committees get their cut, underscoring how much Trump prioritizes paying lawyers. Since the start of 2021, Save America has paid\u00a0nearly $80 million in legal bills\u00a0for Trump and others in his orbit. In April 2024 alone, as Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York got under way, the PAC racked up about $4.4 million in legal expenses between bills paid and outstanding debts, recent filings how. A big recipient: The law firm of Todd Blanche, the lead attorney representing Trump as he battled criminal charges in a Manhattan courtroom that centered on whether he falsified business records to conceal an election-eve payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump was convicted on May 30 and has vowed to appeal. WOLF: Can he simply use campaign dollars for court bills? Does the law allow that? SCHOUTEN: Federal campaign finance law is riddled with all sorts of loopholes. Technically, candidates cannot use money donated to their campaigns for personal expenses \u2013 whether that\u2019s to pay a criminal defense lawyer in a personal matter or to buy groceries. But the agency that enforces federal election law treats leadership PACs such as Save America differently than candidates\u2019 main campaign accounts. Leadership PACs started off as committees created by current and former members of Congress to help boost their profiles and support other candidates. They cannot be used to directly support a presidential campaign. But over the years, they really have become slush funds \u2013 helping underwrite travel, polling, meals and other expenses politicians incur. Keep in mind that Trump\u2019s allies maintain that applying donors\u2019 money to legal expenses is a legitimate use because they characterize all his legal troubles \u2013 whether in civil or criminal cases \u2013 as part of an extensive \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d organized by his enemies to derail his campaign. WOLF: How has the drain of his legal problems affected Trump\u2019s campaign war chest? SCHOUTEN: Well, the bills grew so high that Save America has clawed back tens of millions of dollars from the super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. So, as a practical matter, a super PAC focused on helping Trump get elected ended up diverting money to help pay legal bills during the early months of the presidential campaign. But one thing has become clear: Trump\u2019s team has used his legal difficulties as an engine to generate donations. We\u2019ve seen fundraising spikes during big court appearances but none so big as the nearly $53 million that Trump\u2019s political operation said it brought in in the 24 hours after the New York conviction last month. That single-day haul accounts for more than one-third of the whopping $141 million that the Trump campaign said it raised with the Republican National Committee in May. And MAGA Inc. just announced a May fundraising bonanza, saying it brought in nearly $70 million last month. WOLF: What are the important details we don\u2019t know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: We really don\u2019t have the full picture of legal expenses from campaign finance reports. Senior advisers have told CNN that Trump is paying some of his legal expenses out of pocket, for instance.\u00a0And we don\u2019t know how much the Trump Organization, his real estate and branding company, might be underwriting. During the New York criminal trial, for example, Rhona Graff, the president\u2019s former longtime assistant at the Trump Organization, testified that the company was paying her legal bills. WOLF: A complaint has been filed against Trump for hiding payments to lawyers. What\u2019s that about, and what could come of it? SCHOUTEN: The Campaign Legal Center\u00a0watchdog group filed the complaint with federal election regulators against Trump\u2019s campaign and related committees, alleging they have concealed details on millions of dollars in legal payments by routing the money through a vendor. The complaint centers on more than $7 million paid by Trump-aligned committees to Red Curve Solutions, LLC as \u201creimbursements\u201d for legal expenses \u2013 although the company is not a law firm and largely provides services to help campaigns comply with federal election reporting requirements. Bradley Crate, the treasurer of Trump\u2019s campaign, oversees Red Curve. In its complaint with the Federal Election Commission, the Campaign Legal Center said the payments suggest that Red Curve \u201croutinely advanced money or paid for the cost of legal services provided by other vendors\u201d and was later reimbursed, which would violate disclosure requirements of federal campaign finance law. Neither Crate nor the Trump campaign have responded to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the complaint. Don\u2019t expect action from the FEC anytime soon. The commission \u2013 evenly divided along partisan lines \u2013 often deadlocks on enforcement decisions or takes action years after a complaint is first lodged. WOLF: What is Joe Biden\u2019s team doing differently to test the campaign finance rules this year? SCHOUTEN: I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s doing anything differently, but he\u2019s relying on tactics we\u2019ve seen most politicians use in the big-money era \u2013 even if they have decried the rise of so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that keep their donors\u2019 identities private. The main super PAC supporting Biden\u2019s bid, Future Forward, gets a big chunk of its funding from a nonprofit arm that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors to the public. Our CNN Investigates colleague Casey Tolan earlier this year pored over tax records to report about a couple with ties to artificial intelligence investments and cryptocurrency trading emerging as some of the biggest donors to Future Forward\u2019s dark-money arm. WOLF: Is most of the election spending coming this year from campaigns, super PACs or issue organizations? SCHOUTEN: So far this year, outside groups \u2013 including super PACs and issue organizations \u2013 are leading the spending in advertising in the presidential race, according to a tally of AdImpact data by our CNN colleague David Wright, who keeps close tabs on political ads. That\u2019s not surprising. Candidates face strict limits on the size and source of donations they receive, but super PACs and other outside groups can raise unlimited sums from a wide array of sources. If you include future reservations, the pro-Biden super PAC currently leads presidential spending with some $130 million in ads reserved for the fall. But there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t be overtaken by Republican groups as the general election campaign heats up.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_us-officials-gaza-policy-resignations", "text": "A\u00a0group of US officials\u00a0who publicly resigned over the Biden administration\u2019s Gaza policy are banding together to support ongoing dissent and put pressure on the government to change course. More than half a dozen people from across the US government have left their jobs in public protest, saying they could no longer work for the administration,\u00a0and even more have quietly\u00a0departed. Many of the officials who resigned publicly said they would instead seek to have an impact outside the government. President Joe Biden has faced pressure both abroad and at home over his\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0eight months into the war in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0with Hamas\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0conflict\u00a0that has cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, displaced millions and brought extreme hunger throughout the enclave. Although the rhetoric from the administration has become harsher \u2013 with warnings that Israel must do more to protect civilians and allow more aid in \u2013 the policies have remained largely unchanged. The former officials who\u00a0resigned publicly \u2013 Josh Paul, Harrison Mann, Tariq Habash, Annelle Sheline, Hala Rharrit, Lily Greenberg Call, Alex Smith, and Stacy Gilbert \u2013 said that they felt their perspectives, expertise and concerns were not being heeded, and that the administration was willingly ignoring the humanitarian toll caused by Israel\u2019s military campaign. They spoke of the damage they felt US policy\u00a0on the war\u00a0is\u00a0having on the country\u2019s credibility and a sense that the administration did not fully grasp that impact. All the officials who have resigned publicly and spoke with CNN said they have many colleagues who are still within the government but agree with their decision to leave. Providing support and advice to those colleagues \u2013 whether they choose to leave or continue to dissent from within \u2013 is one of the key reasons that they have come together collectively. Another key reason, they said, is to\u00a0increase the pressure\u00a0on the administration to change course. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about how we can use our shared concern and to continue to press together for change,\u201d said Paul, a State Department official who publicly resigned in protest in October, becoming the first US official to do so. \u201cWhen you have numerous career professionals and presidential appointees \u2026 who have resigned over this policy, it\u2019s an indicator that something is going wrong,\u201d Mann told CNN. Some of those who publicly resigned had particular breaking points; others said it was the collective toll of incidents throughout the conflict. Gilbert, a career diplomat with more than two decades of experience, told CNN she had been working on the highly-anticipated report on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and whether it had restricted humanitarian aid \u2013 but then, \u201cat some point, the subject matter experts who were working on that report were removed, it was moved up to a higher level.\u201d She did not see the report until its public release on May 10. It found it \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law but stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. It also concluded that Israel had not withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of the law. Gilbert said that while the first conclusion was \u201cmore honest than I\u2019d seen us be,\u201d the second was \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d \u201cIt is not the opinion of experts in the US government, experts on humanitarian assistance. It is not the opinion of organizations on the ground in Gaza. So to see that in the report, stated so clearly, that we assess that Israel is not blocking humanitarian assistance \u2013 it was appalling, It was absolutely appalling. And that\u2019s when I decided to resign,\u201d she said, calling the report\u2019s conclusion a \u201cpolitical\u201d one. \u201cTo say it undermines our credibility is an understatement,\u201d Gilbert said. Gilbert left the State Department in May. Biden administration officials have said that they respect differences of opinions. \u201cWe listen to people. We want to hear their opinions. We want to hear the expertise that they bring to bear. But ultimately, it is the president, the secretary, other senior officials that make the decisions about what the policy of the United States ought to be,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said this week. US Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power said in an interview with NPR this week that \u201cwe have a lot of views at USAID that are critical of\u00a0US\u00a0foreign policy. We have views that believe we are pushing and doing everything we can, and my job is to hear those views, and particularly those that are informed by facts on the ground and ideas about what more we can do.\u201d \u201cBecause the situation is abhorrent. Civilians are living in unimaginable terror and in unimaginable deprivation. So if there weren\u2019t people, particularly in an agency like USAID, that is rooted in humanitarian and development mission, who are unhappy about where we are, that would be disappointing in its own right,\u201d she said. \u2018Resignees\u2019 aiming to use \u2018collective power\u2019 The \u201cresignees,\u201d as Smith called them, have all been in touch with each other and are \u201choping to use our collective power to speak in press releases to make our voices well, to speak for many of the staff who are still employed and cannot speak because they would like to keep their jobs, which is a very fair thing.\u201d \u201cIf we can be a resource to help others find their voice, find a way to try to affect some policy change, that would be useful,\u201d said Gilbert, noting there may be new ways that people within the administration make their disagreement over the policy heard. \u201cThe strategy may be changing from writing one dissent cable that many people sign on to individuals writing their own\u201d she said, referencing the formal State Department channel to express opposition, so that \u201cpeople have a way to express what they feel in particular about this and to get a response to each person individually based on their dissent to this policy.\u201d Someone from the department\u2019s leadership commits to sit down with those who file dissent cables. Mann said he has advised people with concerns to both \u201cput them in writing and ask your supervisor or ask your chain of command to give you an assurance with their name on it that what you\u2019re doing is in compliance with both international and US law and with the ethical standards of the organization that you work for.\u201d Smith, who worked for four years at USAID, said he had always found the policies toward Gaza to be \u201clacking\u201d and that his frustrations about the US policies around the war had been building. The \u201cfinal straw,\u201d however, was the cancelation of a presentation he was slated to give on the maternal and child health impacts of the \u201ccollective punishment of civilians,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was apparently the final straw also for USAID because they did come back with that ultimatum that I could resign or be terminated because of personality differences,\u201d he told CNN. He left the agency in May. A USAID spokesperson said the agency \u201cdid not take any personnel actions in response to this presentation,\u201d adding that, \u201cas an agency, we value and intentionally seek out a diversity of viewpoints.\u201d Some of the officials who publicly resigned said they realized in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that the response from the Israeli government was likely to be extreme. Greenberg Call, a former Interior Department employee who became the first Jewish political appointee to publicly resign, told CNN, \u201cI spent the first few weeks after that reeling from dealing with the trauma and the impact of that and the grief of losing people, but I also knew almost immediately that whatever was going to happen, as a reaction, as a response, was going to be really brutal, really, really horrible.\u201d She said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d from the outset by the administration\u2019s response, but \u201cwanted to see what I could do from the inside because of the proximity to power that I had.\u201d She told CNN she felt the concerns she shared were ignored, and \u201cif anything, I was somewhat marked as a troublemaker.\u201d \u201cThere did just come a point where I personally could no longer be in integrity with myself and be representing the administration,\u201d she said. She left in May. Mann, an Army officer who worked at the Defense Intelligence Agency, made the decision to resign in November, just weeks after October 7. He is Jewish and the first member of the intelligence community to publicly resign. \u201cIt was the function of basically hopelessness about the course of the war in Gaza,\u201d he said, telling CNN that it seemed clear to him early on that \u201cthe Israelis were going to be indiscriminately killing huge numbers of civilians,\u201d and that was not going to impact US support. Mann explained that leaving was a \u201cvery slow and drawn-out process,\u201d so he didn\u2019t actually leave his job until this week \u2013 and he didn\u2019t tell people the reason for his resignation until recently for fear of becoming \u201cpersona non-grata.\u201d \u201cI realized after the fact that if I had aired my concerns to my colleagues, and maybe also to my superiors earlier on, I think I would have found a lot of sympathetic ears. And I wish that I\u2019d done that,\u201d he said. Many officials told CNN they spoke with other officials who had resigned publicly to seek advice before going public with their own resignations. \u201cThere\u2019s no manual for how to publicly resign from your job in protest, so it was helpful to talk to people who had done it,\u201d Greenberg Call said.

{"id": "2024_06_09_politics_trump-probation-interview-hush-money", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is scheduled for a pre-sentencing interview with a probation officer Monday after his hush money trial conviction last month, according to a Trump campaign official and two sources familiar with the matter. The interview will be virtual and, as CNN previously reported, Trump attorney Todd Blanche will be present. Typically, a convicted defendant meets with a probation officer without an attorney. Monday\u2019s routine pre-sentencing interview, which was first reported by NBC News, will form part of the report the probation department will submit to Judge Juan Merchan to help decide Trump\u2019s punishment ahead of his sentencing, set for July 11. Last month, a Manhattan jury found Trump \u2013 the presumptive GOP presidential nominee \u2013 guilty of all 34 charges in his hush money trial, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. Trump does not have to cooperate with the routine pre-sentencing investigation, but a judge can take a negative inference from a defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation with the process. In the pre-sentencing interview, a defendant is typically asked about their conviction and other basic background information such as their employment and criminal history. As part of the process, Trump\u2019s legal team can submit letters of support from his friends and family to Merchan. The former president\u2019s team is scheduled to submit its sentencing recommendation Thursday, according to a source familiar with the plan. \u201cPresident Trump and his legal team are already taking necessary steps to challenge and defeat the lawless Manhattan DA case,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement Saturday. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office will also submit a memo telling the judge what sentence it sees fit for Trump. Merchan could sentence Trump to probation or up to four years in state prison on each count, with a maximum of 20 years. Prosecutors have never sought to remand Trump into custody, so the former president is free as he awaits sentencing.

The Biden administration has been leading a campaign to persuade leaders of the fellow G7 nations \u2013 the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan \u2013 to sign off on a plan that it views as vital to giving Ukraine a shot at turning around its prospects on the battlefield as it continues to fend off the Russian assault. The ultimate goal, sources said, is to iron out some of the thorniest financing details in the coming days so that an agreement can be announced as part of the G7 leaders\u2019 communiqu\u00e9 this week. But questions about the modalities of such a program \u2013 including the precise form of disbursement and repayment assurances, among others \u2013 are still in the process of being worked out. US officials argue that the dire situation for Ukraine makes the approval of such a loan deeply urgent. Even if the details behind what officials hope could amount to up to a $50 billion loan package have not yet been finalized, the G7 nations are in agreement on the urgency of the moment \u2013 and Ukraine\u2019s desperate need for a lifeline. The world\u2019s richest economies coming together behind such a plan would send a stark message to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, US officials say, that Russia will not outlast the US and its allies\u2019 continued support for Ukraine. \u201cThis is a priority for the United States. We believe it\u2019s a priority for the entire G7,\u201d Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters last week. \u201cWe want to see every country come on board with a method by which we can mobilize resources for\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0at scale so that they are able to have what they need to be able to succeed in this war.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be present at the G7 gathering to once again press for more assistance on the global stage. Biden\u2019s upcoming trip to Italy will come on the heels of his multi-day visit to France, where the US\u2019 support for Ukraine\u2019s war efforts emerged as a major theme.

As he vowed that the US is \u201cnot going to walk away from you,\u201d Biden publicly apologized this week to Zelensky for Congress\u2019 months-long delay in approving additional American assistance for Ukraine. The delay, US officials have said in recent months, undoubtedly resulted in Ukraine losing valuable ground on the battlefield. \u201cI apologize for the weeks of not knowing what\u2019s going to pass, in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up, but we got it done,\u201d Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/politics/us-ukraine-loan-50-billion-frozen-russian-assets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_politics_us-military-niger-withdrawal-deadline", "text": "The US began pulling military equipment and additional personnel out of Niger on Friday after waiting months for the ruling military junta to approve US military flights into the country, the US Department of Defense and the Department of National Defense of the Republic of Niger announced Saturday. The news comes ahead of a September 15 withdrawal deadline agreed to by the two countries. The US priority was first to remove sensitive equipment from Niger, a source familiar with the matter said. Flight tracking websites showed US C-17 cargo aircraft en route to the Nigerien capital of Niamey on Friday. Much of the US military and equipment\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0in Niamey at what\u2019s known as Base 101. A source confirmed this flight was to withdraw military equipment and some personnel. Last month, the US and Niger reached an agreement for the withdrawal of American forces from the country, giving the military four months to pull approximately 1,000 US personnel and military equipment from the West African nation. Niger had been a central hub from which the US carried out surveillance of violent extremist groups in the region, including the use of MQ-9 Reaper drones. The US also trained Nigerien troops. But the coup in Niger last July brought to a halt the training mission. The relationship between the US and the military junta grew increasingly strained as Biden administration officials called for a clear path to free and fair elections. Despite efforts to maintain a military presence in Niger, the military junta called earlier this year for the withdrawal of US forces from the country, a process complicated by the need to remove sensitive US equipment. The US was also forced to wait for the Nigerien military junta to approve flight clearances to withdraw personnel and equipment, an agreement which was only reached last month. US personnel who left before the agreement had taken commercial flights out of the country, US officials said. As the US has prepared to withdraw from the country, Russian forces have moved in, operating at the same base as US forces. The arrangement, which put the two militaries in relative proximity, was a point of contention between the US and Niger, and it further underscored concern that the country\u2019s military junta was turning toward the Kremlin. Russia and Niger agreed to strengthen their military ties in January, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said at the time. Russia has worked hard to expand its influence in the region. This week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Burkina Faso and said Russia would increase the number of military instructors working in the country. In early March, the head of US Africa Command, Gen. Michael Langley, warned Congress that Russia is aggressively working to expand its footing among African countries, leaving several \u201cat the tipping point\u201d of falling under its influence. As late as last month, some US defense officials expressed a measure of confidence that future cooperation with Niger was possible, based on years of work together countering extremist groups in neighboring countries like Mali and Burkina Faso.\u00a0That hope has subsided; another official told CNN\u00a0it\u2019s unlikely the US will continue any meaningful relationship with the current Nigerien leadership, especially while Russian influence continues to expand in the region.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/politics/us-military-niger-withdrawal-deadline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_politics_kamala-harris-byron-donalds", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris, in an interview published Monday, criticized a suggestion made last week by Republican Rep. Byron Donalds that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Politico reports that the vice president called up the outlet to weigh in on former President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he will pick a running mate at next month\u2019s Republican convention. She mostly withheld comment on individual prospects, Politico said, though she did pointedly criticize Donalds, who is among those considered a potential running mate for Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s sadly yet another example of somebody out of Florida trying to erase or rewrite our true history,\u201d Harris said, referring to the state\u2019s interventions under Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis into Black history curriculums. \u201cI went to Florida last July to call out what they were trying to do to replace our history with lies. And apparently there\u2019s a never ending flow of that coming out of that state.\u201d Donalds\u2019 comments,\u00a0which come as Trump\u2019s campaign seeks to make inroads with non-White voters,\u00a0were made at\u00a0an event in Philadelphia with\u00a0Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, another Black Republican supporter of the former president. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said at the event last week, the\u00a0Philadelphia Inquirer reported. \u201cDuring Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative \u2014 because Black people have always been conservative-minded \u2014 but more Black people voted conservatively,\u201d he said. In the interview with Politico, the vice president contrasted the Biden administration\u2019s position on abortion with those of the prospective GOP vice presidential nominees. \u201cEveryone on that list has supported a Trump abortion ban in their state or has called for a national ban. \u2026 In fact, many\u00a0voted this week in the Senate\u00a0against the right to contraception. That\u2019s how far down the road they are,\u201d said Harris, who has led the White House\u2019s messaging campaign in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2022 to overturn the federal right to an abortion. As vice president, Harris has previously waded into culture war issues,\u00a0traveling to Florida last year to slam Florida Republicans\u00a0after the state Board of Education revised standards for teaching Black history. During the visit last July, Harris highlighted standards that, according to a document posted to the state\u2019s Department of Education website, require instruction for middle schoolers to include \u201chow slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\u201d \u201cWe know the history. And let us not let these politicians who are trying to divide our country win\u201d Harris said at the time. \u201cThey are creating these unnecessary debates. This is unnecessary to debate whether enslaved people benefited from slavery. Are you kidding me? Are we supposed to debate that?\u201d The vice president has often served as the administration\u2019s messenger on an array of hot-button issues. Last month she was deployed to Jacksonville, Florida,\u00a0just hours after a controversial ban\u00a0on most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy went into effect in the state, ratcheting up the Biden campaign\u2019s message\u00a0blaming Trump for strict abortion restrictions being adopted across the country in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. In April, she traveled to Tucson just days after a state Supreme Court ruling upholding a Civil War-era ban on abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/politics/kamala-harris-byron-donalds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
