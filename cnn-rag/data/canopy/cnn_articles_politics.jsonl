{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_biden-denounce-icc-warrant-israel-hamas", "text": "The Biden administration on Monday forcefully denounced efforts by the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants for top Israeli officials and Hamas leaders, saying the court\u2019s efforts put the terrorist organization and a top US ally on equivalent footing. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Monday that the international tribunal is seeking arrest warrants for officials including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their respective roles in the October 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent war that has left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead. The prosecution team is also seeking warrants for Israel\u2019s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, along with top Hamas leaders, Khan said. In a statement Monday, Biden called the ICC\u2019s efforts \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d the president said in the statement, \u201cwhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2013 none \u2013 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d Speaking at a White House reception marking Jewish American Heritage Month later Monday, Biden reiterated his stance that the ICC\u2019s pursuit of an arrest warrant is without merit. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Israel wants to do all it can to ensure civilian protection,\u201d Biden said. \u201cLet me be clear: What\u2019s happening is not genocide.\u201d Khan\u2019s pursuit of the warrants gave Biden \u2013 a longtime supporter of Israel and its right to exist \u2013 a chance to speak strongly in favor of the US\u2019 top Middle Eastern ally at a time of tense relations between the president and Israeli leadership. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett earlier this month, Biden put conditions on US aid to Israel for the first time over Israel\u2019s planned invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza. Biden has also had multiple frank phone calls with the Israeli prime minister in recent months as he tries to cajole Netanyahu into pursuing options that don\u2019t involve a military operation in a population center. The announcement marks the first time that the ICC has sought an arrest warrant for the leader of a top US ally, and places Netanyahu in the company of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the late Libyan despot Moammar Gadhafi \u2013 both of whom were subjects of arrest efforts by the ICC. Khan, the ICC prosecutor, batted down criticisms over the tribunal\u2019s efforts to secure the warrants. \u201cNobody is above the law,\u201d he told Amanpour. Neither the US nor Israel are members of the ICC. But if the court were to grant an arrest warrant for Netanyahu or Gallant, the decision would make it extremely difficult for either Israeli leader to travel to any of the 124 countries that are party to the court\u2019s laws, including top US allies such as Britain and Germany, which would compel member nations to cooperate with efforts to extradite those subjected to the warrants. News that the ICC is seeking warrants for the Israeli leaders\u00a0led to\u00a0condemnation\u00a0from the\u00a0US and some of its allies. Britain said the court\u2019s efforts were \u201cnot helpful\u201d in reaching a pause in fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States \u201cfundamentally rejects\u201d the court\u2019s announcement, saying it \u201ccould jeopardize\u201d efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal between the warring parties. Biden administration officials also questioned whether the ICC had the jurisdiction to seek those arrests. House Speaker Mike Johnson, describing the ICC\u2019s efforts as \u201cbaseless and illegitimate,\u201d said House GOP leaders would look at sanctions in response to the court\u2019s decision. National Security Council spokesperson\u00a0John Kirby said the Biden administration plans to stay in close touch with members of Congress but stopped short of committing support for any Republican effort to levy new sanctions on the ICC. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 who caucuses with Democrats even as his position on Israel is frequently at odds with Biden\u2019s \u2014 said he supported the ICC\u2019s decision. Sanders is one of the country\u2019s most prominent Jewish politicians and has been critical of Israel\u2019s war effort. \u201cThe ICC prosecutor is right to take these actions,\u201d Sanders said in a statement, adding it is \u201cimperative that the global community uphold international law.\u201d Despite strong condemnation of the ICC efforts from Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, several senior Senate Democrats pointedly refused to take a position, underscoring the growing rift within the party over Israel\u2019s handling of the war. Asked if she agreed with the ICC decision, Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju: \u201cI would say that I\u2019m not supportive of Netanyahu or Hamas, and I think we\u2019d be able to move forward a lot better if both were to go.\u201d But others aligned themselves with Biden. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who faces a tough reelection in Ohio, criticized the ICC prosecutor. \u201cI don\u2019t see any moral equivalence between the democratic government of Israel and a terrorist group like Hamas, none,\u201d he told CNN. The condemnation of the ICC\u2019s efforts puts the United States in a delicate position. The United States is supporting a separate effort by the ICC to document and investigate Russian war crimes related to its continued operations in Ukraine. Kirby said the US would continue to support those efforts. \u201cI would remind everybody that it is an actual war aim of Mr. Putin to kill innocent Ukrainian people,\u201d Kirby told reporters Monday. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure with the aim of killing innocent civilians. \u201cThat is not what the IDF is doing,\u201d Kirby added. Still, Kirby acknowledged, the United States continues to urge the Israeli government to be \u201cmore discriminative, more targeted, [and] more precise\u201d in its Gaza operations.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_republican-senators-alito-upside-down-flag", "text": "Key Republican senators sharply criticized Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito after\u00a0news reports showed an upside-down American flag\u00a0\u2013 a symbol\u00a0used by some supporters of former President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0who challenged the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory \u2013 flying outside his home in 2021. Such criticism of a conservative justice from high-ranking GOP senators is extremely rare and a sign of how unusual the controversy is. In a brief interview with CNN, Senate Republican Whip John Thune, one of the contenders vying to replace retiring Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, called the flag a \u201cbad decision.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you explain that,\u201d Thune said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for Alito\u00a0to have an American flag hanging upside down at his home. \u201cIt creates a bad image,\u201d Graham told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cIt created a situation that we\u2019re all talking about. So, yeah, I think it was a mistake.\u201d Utah Republican Sen.\u00a0Mitt\u00a0Romney echoed concerns about the flag. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate and we ought to take a look at it,\u201d he said to reporters. The upside-down flag became a symbol of the\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d\u00a0movement in the weeks and months following the election,\u00a0in which Trump\u2019s supporters falsely claimed that Biden\u2019s win was illegitimate due to\u00a0widespread fraud. The inverted flag was widely seen during the January 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol. The New York Times published a photo of the inverted flag, which it said was seen at the justice\u2019s home in Alexandria,\u00a0Virginia, on\u00a0January\u00a017, 2021. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in an emailed statement to\u00a0the\u00a0Times. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d Many Republicans who spoke to CNN, however, defended Alito or downplayed the matter. Even some who questioned his judgment over the incident still defended his role on the court. \u201cThere\u2019s always accusations made about, you know, members of this court, and the left has tried very hard to discredit them,\u201d Thune said.\u00a0\u201cThis is a court that\u2019s looking at the law in the Constitution and interpreting it as they should.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he should be recused,\u201d Graham told Raju. Many Republicans vehemently argued against calls for Alito to recuse himself from Trump- and election-related cases. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Judiciary Committee who is running to be GOP leader, said, \u201cthere are more important things to worry about.\u201d Cornyn described the focus on the upside -down flag as \u201ccontinued harassment\u201d against Alito. \u201cEver since Clarence Thomas experienced what he called the high-tech lynching, I think we\u2019ve seen repeated efforts to try to undermine the credibility of the Supreme Court. And this is just the latest episode,\u201d Cornyn added. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, also a member of the Judiciary Committee, said news of the flag is the \u201clatest attempt by the left to attack and question the Supreme Court.\u201d\u00a0He said calls by Democrats for\u00a0Alito\u00a0to recuse himself from some cases involving Trump is \u201can idiotic thing to think that has nothing to do with what\u2019s going on.\u201d GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said, \u201cThis is America and Mrs.\u00a0Alito\u00a0is entitled to her opinion, but I don\u2019t see any proof whatsoever that Justice\u00a0Alito\u00a0had anything\u00a0to do with it.\u201d Kennedy also weighed in on the role and obligations of Supreme Court spouses. \u201cShould they be discreet and judicious in the way they articulate their point of view?\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 But they don\u2019t have to be,\u201d Kennedy said. Another GOP senator seemed to downplay the issue as a dispute between neighbors. \u201cIt sounded like some kind of neighborhood thing.\u00a0I don\u2019t really have a comment on it,\u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia. CNN\u2019s John Fritze, Lauren Fox, Morgan Rimmer and Manu Raju contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_us-assesses-russia-launched-counter-space-weapon", "text": "The US has assessed that Russia likely launched a counter space weapon last week that is close to, and capable of attacking, a US government satellite orbiting nearby,\u00a0US Ambassador Robert Wood said at the UN on Monday. It is not the first time Russia has launched a counter space weapon, which is designed to incapacitate or destroy satellites. But the last time it did so was in 2022, said Wood,\u00a0who serves as the US alternative representative for Special Political Affairs at the UN. The launch comes at a time the US and its allies are increasingly concerned about Russia\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear space weapon capable of destroying commercial and government satellites. \u201cOn May 16, Russia launched a satellite into low Earth orbit that the United States assesses is likely a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit,\u201d Wood said\u00a0in remarks before a vote on a UN Security Council resolution drafted by Russia on outer space security.\u00a0\u201cRussia deployed this new counterspace weapon into the same orbit as a US government satellite.\u201d Wood added that the May 16 launch \u201cfollows prior Russian satellite launches likely of counterspace systems to low Earth orbit in 2019 and 2022.\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday that US\u00a0assessments of the Russian satellite \u201cfurther indicate characteristics resembling previously deployed counterspace payloads, from 2019 and 2022.\u201d The ambassador called the launch \u201ctroubling,\u201d and said it undermines Russia\u2019s claims that it is seeking outer space security.\u00a0A US official separately told CNN that the US had been expecting the launch for at least several weeks,\u00a0and North American Aerospace Defense Command and US Northern Command tracked it as it happened, according to a defense official. Russia issued at least 2 NOTAMs \u2014 Notices to Airmen \u2014 that became active on May 16 indicating a possible space launch. One was for the launch itself and the other was for the re-entry of a Russian space launch booster off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. \u201cThe good news is that the NOTAM is the responsible, normal way for nations to support safe air and maritime activities,\u201d the defense official said. The US and\u00a0its allies have been working to deter Russia from developing a nuclear space weapon, CNN previously reported. If deployed, such a weapon could destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated, potentially crippling a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to talk on cell phones, pay bills, and surf the internet. In April, the US and Japan jointly introduced a UN Security Council resolution that called for UN member states not to develop space-based nuclear weapons, but Russia vetoed against it \u2014 something the US saw as a sign that it is indeed pursuing a nuclear space-based weapon. \u201cAs we have noted previously, the United States assesses that Russia is developing a new satellite carrying a nuclear device,\u201d National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement on April 24. \u201cWe have heard President Putin say publicly that Russia has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. If that were the case, Russia would not have vetoed this resolution.\u201d The Russian weapon is still under development and is not yet in orbit, Biden administration officials have emphasized publicly. But if used, officials say, it would cross a dangerous Rubicon in the history of nuclear weapons. Russia introduced its own rival resolution earlier this month, calling for the prohibition \u201cfor all time\u201d on the placement of weapons in our space. But the US vetoed it on Monday because it \u201cdoes not achieve the simple task that we set out to achieve several months ago: reaffirm the basic obligations of the Outer Space Treaty and avoid a nuclear arms race in space,\u201d Wood said. The US ambassador took particular issue with the resolution\u2019s call for a\u00a0binding mechanism to ban any space-based weapons, saying such a ban \u201ccannot be verified\u201d and that the resolution was an attempt by\u00a0Russia \u201cto distract global attention from its development of a new satellite carrying a nuclear device.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/us-assesses-russia-launched-counter-space-weapon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_biden-morehouse-commencement", "text": "President Joe Biden touted his administration\u2019s efforts to place Black Americans into the highest echelons of political power during a Sunday commencement address at Morehouse College, while also acknowledging the anguish simmering among young people across the US over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The president, speaking to graduates at a preeminent college for Black men, delivered a forceful call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza paired with the release of Israeli hostages \u2013 while urging a long-term political solution to the crisis. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking: Hamas\u2019 vicious attack on Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage; innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this \u2013 men, women and children killed or displaced and in desperate need of water, food and medicine,\u201d the president said. Biden faced a delicate balancing act ahead of his speech at Morehouse, where some students and faculty members opposed the president\u2019s presence on campus because of his stalwart support for Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas. The White House worked for weeks to quell concerns, and it hoped the address would give Biden an opportunity to better connect with young Black men, a group that has been increasingly moving away from the president, according to recent polls. Biden and his campaign know the support of Black Americans will be critical for his chances of returning to the White House \u2014 especially in battlegrounds such as Georgia, where the president delivered Morehouse\u2019s commencement, and Michigan, where he cast former President Donald Trump as \u201cunhinged\u201d during remarks at an NAACP dinner later Sunday. Prior to Biden\u2019s commencement address, the school\u2019s valedictorian in his speech invoked the name of one of its most famous alumni, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to call for an end to the violence in Gaza. DeAngelo\u00a0Fletcher said it was his \u201cstance as a Morehouse Man \u2013 nay, as a human being \u2013 to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\u201d And as Biden began speaking, some graduates took part in a silent protest; one unfurled a Palestinian flag, while a handful of others turned their backs to the president. But Biden delivered his speech without any noticeable interruptions. Biden acknowledged young Americans\u2019 frustrations about the crisis in the Middle East and said the issue hits close to home. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world, and there\u2019s nothing easy about it \u2013 I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family,\u201d Biden said. CNN has previously reported\u00a0first lady Jill Biden has privately expressed concern\u00a0over the humanitarian toll in Gaza. He added: \u201cI know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates have enjoyed the support of Black Americans since the Civil Rights Movement, and Biden\u2019s history with the community runs deep. But polling has shown an erosion in support for the president from Black voters dissatisfied with his handling of the economy and his support for Israel. Spending much of his speech focused on democracy, Biden said there has been a recent national effort to obfuscate America\u2019s historical wrongs against its Black citizens. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be a president at a time when there\u2019s a national effort to ban books,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNot to write history, but to erase history. They don\u2019t see you in the future of America. But they\u2019re wrong. To me, we make history, not erase it. We know Black history is American history.\u201d Extremist forces, Biden told the group of male graduates, peddle falsehoods about what masculinity is about. \u201cTheir idea of being a man is toxic. I ran into them all the time when I was younger. \u2026 But that\u2019s not you, that\u2019s not us. You all know and demonstrate what it really means to be a man,\u201d he said. Trumpeting his support for the nation\u2019s historically Black colleges and universities, Biden said he had \u201cno doubt a Morehouse man will be president one day \u2013 just after an AKA from Howard.\u201d The remark seemed to demonstrate Biden\u2019s hopes for the political future of Vice President Kamala Harris, a member of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority who graduated from the Washington, DC, HBCU. Over the last several months, Biden has largely shied away from addressing large crowds of young people on college campuses, a change that came shortly after his January remarks on abortion rights at Virginia\u2019s George Mason University were interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters outraged at his continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza. Since then, and as the death toll in Gaza of civilians, aid workers and journalists has continued to rise, that anger has only spread. More than 1,360 student demonstrations have taken place on campuses across the country from October 7 to May 3, according to data compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. The overwhelming majority of those demonstrations \u2013 97% \u2013 have been peaceful, though isolated cases of property destruction and violence have gained widespread attention. Those instances reached a crescendo in late April and early May, when students at Columbia University overtook some university buildings, an encampment at the University of Texas in Austin was forcefully dispersed by police, and counterprotesters at UCLA launched an hourslong attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment. Those cases of campus turmoil prompted Biden, in brief remarks from the White House earlier this month, to denounce some of the actions of campus protesters. \u201cI understand people have strong feelings of deep convictions,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cIn America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express that. But it doesn\u2019t mean anything goes.\u201d While dissent is \u201cessential to democracy,\u201d Biden said in those remarks, it \u201cmust never lead to disorder, or to denying the rights of others.\u201d Biden\u2019s Morehouse commencement was the latest in a series of efforts undertaken by the president in recent days to both acknowledge the nation\u2019s historic racial shortcomings while simultaneously addressing its next generation of Black leaders. Speaking at the NAACP dinner in Detroit on Sunday evening, Biden sought to send a warning about his opponent, saying the presumptive GOP nominee \u201cposes a bigger threat\u201d in a second term than a first. \u201cIt\u2019s clear when he lost, something snapped in him,\u201d the president said of Trump, reiterating remarks he has previously made off-camera at campaign fundraisers. Noting that the former president has vowed to pardon January 6, 2021, rioters, Biden questioned how Trump would have responded if many of those storming the US Capitol were Black: \u201cLet me ask you: What do you think he would have done on January 6 if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? No, I\u2019m serious. What do you think? I can only imagine.\u201d Last week, the president met with the plaintiffs of the historic Brown v.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_michael-cohen-testimony-trump-trial", "text": "The biggest questions as Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial resumes Monday are whether his attorneys have destroyed the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen \u2014 and how much of the damage prosecutors can fix. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee is due back in court amid clear signs the hush money trial is drawing toward a close \u2014 unless he takes the risky decision to testify in his own defense, a step that would lengthen and complicate the proceedings. Defense lawyers say they expect to complete their bruising cross-examination of Cohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and enforcer, on Monday morning. Prosecutors will then use their second chance to question Cohen to try to patch up any doubts the ex-president\u2019s team may have sown in the minds of jurors about his version of events. New York state prosecutors allege Trump broke the law by falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. This, they say, was to deceive voters in 2016 in an early example of election interference. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. In dramatic testimony, Cohen last week directly implicated Trump in the alleged scheme, saying the former president directed him to hand over $130,000 to Daniels and promised him reimbursement. \u201cJust do it,\u201d Cohen said in describing his boss\u2019s alleged order to make the payment \u2014 insisting that Trump was worried the story could doom his campaign. But in a critical moment under cross-examination, Cohen appeared to trip up over an account of a call he\u2019d previously said under oath was to discuss the payment. But the call, at least to begin with, appeared to be about another matter entirely. Trump attorney Todd Blanche produced a text from before the call that Cohen sent to bodyguard Keith Schiller, who was with Trump at the time, in which Cohen said he wanted help dealing with a 14-year-old who was prank calling him. He didn\u2019t mention Daniels in the text despite later testifying that the purpose of the call was to discuss the situation surrounding her. \u201cThat was a lie!\u201d Blanche declared, leading Cohen to insist: \u201cI believe I also spoke to President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it\u2019s going to be resolved.\u201d The defense is also trying to portray Cohen as being obsessed with bringing Trump down and has brought up a stream of insults he flung the ex-president\u2019s way on social media and television, including when he called Trump a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d Cohen has long been seen as a potentially problematic witness, given his record of falsehoods and his own conviction \u2014 for events related to the hush money payment and for other offenses including lying to Congress. The prosecution, therefore, built a structure of testimony before he took the stand, including from former associates of the ex-president, to try to corroborate what he would say. But they apparently did not foresee everything, including the text exchange with Schiller. In their redirect examination, therefore, prosecutors are likely to try to mitigate Cohen\u2019s testimony about the call. But if jurors think Cohen lied about the content of the call with Schiller and about whether he spoke to Trump, they could begin to doubt other aspects of his testimony. \u201cThat is exactly what the judge will instruct the jury: \u2018If you find anything that a witness said to be untrue, to be incredible, to be a lie, feel free to disregard the entirety of that witness\u2019s testimony,\u2019\u201d Randy Zelin, a trial attorney and adjunct professor at Cornell Law School, said on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d on Friday. Trump\u2019s lawyers need to create reasonable doubt in the minds of just one juror to open the possibility of a hung jury or an acquittal. Questions mount over scope of defense case Scrutiny of Cohen\u2019s testimony was the latest twist in the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s multifront legal saga, which includes three other criminal indictments and has meant the path to the 2024 election has run more through the courts than the campaign trail. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him \u2014 in two cases related to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and one over his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. And he\u2019s rooted his bid to reclaim the White House in claims of political persecution. There is no evidence that Trump is the victim of a coordinated attempt by President Joe Biden to weaponize the justice system against his rival, despite such claims by a parade of Republican lawmakers flocking to the Manhattan court in recent days. The most prominent visitor was House Speaker Mike Johnson, who brought the symbolism of his office to bear in an extraordinary attack on the judge and the case. The Louisiana Republican also attempted to discredit Cohen, joining fellow Republicans in bolstering Trump\u2019s own attacks after the judge threatened the ex-president with jail if he continued to infringe on a limited gag order. With the end of Cohen\u2019s testimony looming, there is uncertainty over the extent of Trump\u2019s defense case. His attorneys have said they may call at least one witness \u2014 Bradley Smith, a former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission. Judge Juan Merchan indicated Thursday that he was reluctant to change limits he has already placed on the scope of any such testimony. Merchan has ruled Smith could discuss the role and function of the FEC and define certain terms related to campaign finance but cannot say whether the law was violated in this case. The greatest unknown \u2014 apart from the verdict \u2014 is whether Trump will take the stand There are many reasons why testimony from the accused is often viewed as risky for the defense in any case. But when the defendant is as difficult to control and prone to assaulting the truth as the former president, the stakes are even higher. Trump initially said he would testify \u2014 as he often threatens to do in his legal dramas \u2014 but then appeared to backtrack by falsely claiming a gag order in the case designed to protect witnesses and court staff meant he could not. Blanche referred to the possibility of Trump\u2019s testimony on Thursday, the last day the court was in session. \u201cThat\u2019s another decision that we need to think through,\u201d Blanche said. After days on the defensive, Trump\u2019s attorneys may have finally succeeded in making the credibility of Cohen an important factor in the trial last week. But an appearance by Trump could be a massive distraction from Cohen\u2019s problems. It could also open up the former president to being probed on inconsistencies in his own story. And Trump may be asked about details of the alleged liaison with Daniels in Lake Tahoe in 2006 that he denies took place. Trump has often left no doubt that he considers himself his own best advocate. Throughout his business career and political life, he has been notoriously impossible for subordinates to control. During this trial, he has used breaks in courtroom action to address reporters to shape public perceptions of the case because there are no television cameras in court. The temptation to take the most critical turn in his own trial \u2014 and to try to create even more of a political circus than he has already \u2014 may be irresistible. Trump did take the stand in a civil fraud case against him, his adult sons, and his business organization in November. The judge in that trial, Arthur Engoron, tried initially to keep Trump under control, but the testimony soon turned into a replica of the ex-president\u2019s unchained campaign trial rhetoric, much to the judge\u2019s frustration. And Trump\u2019s histrionics appear to have harmed him as Engoron wrote in a civil judgment against Trump worth nearly half a billion dollars that the ex-president and his sons showed a complete lack of contrition and remorse for massive frauds that bordered on the \u201cpathological.\u201d The critical difference in the hush money criminal case is that it will be adjudicated by a jury and not a judge. After the defense case wraps up, the prosecution has a chance to put on its own rebuttal. Next come the summations of the case from prosecutors and the defense \u2014 a process Merchan said he hopes to begin as early as Tuesday. Then, the lawyers leave the stage, and the judge instructs members of the jury on the law they must apply in their deliberations. It is at that point, when the jurors retire to consider their verdict, that the country will be in suspense, waiting for the unprecedented moment when it will learn whether, for the first time, a former president will be convicted of a crime.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-trump-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_same-sex-marriage-what-matters", "text": "It\u2019s hard to believe today, when the vast majority of Americans support it, but just 20 years ago the issue of same-sex marriage divided the country and drove voter turnout. The vast majority of Americans opposed same-sex marriage on May 17, 2004, when the first same-sex couples took their vows after a court decision in Massachusetts. The state\u2019s Republican governor at the time, Mitt Romney, planned to invoke an archaic 1913 law in an attempt to bar same-sex couples from traveling from other states to obtain marriages in Massachusetts. Then-President George W. Bush, a Republican running for reelection, gave an address from the White House that year actively pushing to amend the US Constitution to \u201cprotect\u201d marriage, which he described as \u201cthe most fundamental institution of civilization.\u201d There was verifiable backlash to marriage equality in November 2004, when voters in 11 states \u2013 ranging from reliably red Utah to reliably blue Oregon \u2013 codified in their constitutions that marriage should be between a man and a woman. The marriage amendment approved in Ohio by an overwhelming majority may have helped sway that pivotal state into Bush\u2019s column as he retained the White House. The effort to oppose same-sex marriage certainly didn\u2019t hurt him in the state. Without Ohio, Bush would have lost to then-Sen. John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who opposed same-sex marriages taking place in his own state. The 2015 Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, by which a divided 5-4 court would ultimately grant a right to same-sex marriage, sprang up as a result of this Ohio amendment. In CNN exit polls for the presidential election in 2004, just a quarter of all American voters that year said they supported marriage rights for same-sex couples. A larger proportion, 35%, supported giving same-sex couples the ability to enter into civil unions. And 37% opposed legal recognition of same-sex unions. Barack Obama notably opposed same-sex marriage when he ran for president as a Democrat in the 2008 election and, as public opinion was rapidly shifting, changed his tune in 2012 to support same-sex unions. In eight years, the US went from the winning candidate (Bush in 2004) exploiting opposition to same-sex marriage to win reelection, to the winning candidate (Obama in 2012) changing his position to support marriage equality before winning reelection. Now, it\u2019s Congress protecting same-sex marriage from the Supreme Court A decade later, in 2022, the person Obama beat in 2012, now-Sen. Romney, voted in favor of protecting same-sex unions in the event the US Supreme Court decided to strip away the national right to marry that it granted in 2015. The court today is much more conservative than it was in 2015 after two justices who supported same-sex marriage rights, Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were replaced with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, respectively. Two current conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, still publicly grouse about the Obergefell decision, but it\u2019s not clear if an opportunity to overturn the decision will present itself or if the conservative justices who weren\u2019t on the court in 2015 would support removing the right to same-sex marriage in the same way they endorsed removing a right to abortion. Romney does not now support same-sex marriages, but he made clear when he voted to protect them from the Supreme Court that he does respect people who have entered into them: \u201cWhile I believe in traditional marriage,\u201d Romney said in a statement, \u201cObergefell is and has been the law of the land upon which LGBTQ individuals have relied. This legislation provides certainty to many\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0Americans,\u00a0and it signals that Congress\u2014and I\u2014esteem and love all of our fellow Americans equally.\u201d The Respect for Marriage Act that Romney supported does not guarantee a national right to same-sex marriage if the Supreme Court changes course, but it does require every state to honor marriages conducted legally in other states. If the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell, most states still have laws and constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage, according to an analysis by Stateline. \u2018Stunning\u2019 reversal The annual American Values survey conducted by PRRI in 2023 found a strong majority of Americans \u2013 more than two-thirds \u2013 now support same-sex unions, but the support varies. In states that protect same-sex marriage regardless of Obergefell, support is over 70%. Support falls to 64% in states where same-sex marriage would end without Obergefell. I talked to Alex Lundry, a Republican pollster and longtime supporter of same-sex marriage,  about how he views this 20-year pivot in public opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning in its reversal,\u201d Lundry said, adding, \u201cin my opinion, it\u2019s the most significant and substantial shift in public opinion of the modern polling era.\u201d 20% of Gen Z identifies as LGBTQ Lundry pointed to a series of data points to explain the overwhelming shift in public opinion: \u25ba First, more people identify as LGBTQ. He pointed to data from Gallup,  which saw the portion of the population who identify as LGBTQ more than double from 3.5% in 2012, when the organization first started asking people about their sexual orientation, to 7.2% 2022, the last year for which it has data. \u25ba More importantly, maybe, is that almost 20% of Gen Z Americans, those born between 1997 and 2004, identify as LGBTQ, with most of them identifying as bisexual. \u25ba As a result, more people know and care about someone who is gay. That trend was already underway back in 2004, when Bush\u2019s vice president, Dick Cheney, one of whose daughters is gay, openly disagreed with the push for an anti-same-sex marriage constitutional amendment. Today there is far more representation of gay outlooks in the media and in government, where the organization Out for America, which tracks representation, found the number of openly LGBTQ lawmakers rose from less than 500 in 2017 to nearly 1,200 in 2023. \u25ba Underlying all of that is that the number of same-sex couples has more than doubled from less than 600,000 in 2008 to more than 1.2 million in 2021, roughly 710,000 of which are married, according to Census Bureau data. Warnings were unfounded There is also evidence that warnings about same-sex marriage somehow endangering \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d simply never materialized. A new study by researchers for the RAND Corporation to assess two decades of same-sex marriage in the US argues marriage rates actually increased among opposite-sex couples as same-sex couples were granted the ability to marry in certain states. Physical health also improved in those states for same-sex couples, according to the study. Another societal shift Abortion rights are another social issue politicians hope to use to move the coming election. A key difference between support for same-sex marriage and support for abortion rights, according to Lundry, is that support for abortion rights has remained positive for decades, in contrast to same-sex marriage, which saw a complete turnaround. The only other issue where he argued there has been such a pivot is on legalizing marijuana, support for which has gone from about a third in 2002 to 70% in 2023, according to Gallup. Not at all coincidentally, President Joe Biden has moved in this election year to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug, acknowledging there are legitimate uses for it and making the government view it as a substance with a lower risk for abuse. Meanwhile, the ever-evolving fight over LGBTQ rights continues. An issue driving state legislatures today is transgender rights, particularly regarding children and gender-affirming care.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/same-sex-marriage-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_ai-2024-election-interference-dhs-warns", "text": "Artificial intelligence tools for creating fake video, audio and other content will likely give foreign operatives and domestic extremists \u201cenhanced opportunities for interference\u201d as the 2024 US election cycle progresses, the Department of Homeland Security said in a recent bulletin distributed to state and local officials and obtained by CNN. A variety of \u201cthreat actors\u201d will likely try to use generative AI \u2014\u00a0or AI that creates fake content \u2014 to influence or \u201csow discord\u201d during the US election cycle, says the May 17 bulletin, which was produced by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis. While a \u201clarge-scale attack on the election is less likely\u201d because of the \u201chigher risk of detection and the decentralized and diverse nature of the voting system,\u201d the bulletin says, \u201cthreat actors might still attempt to conduct limited operations leading to disruptions in key election battleground areas.\u201d Foreign or domestic operatives could, for example, try to \u201cconfuse or overwhelm\u201d voters and election staff by distributing fake or altered video or audio clips claiming that a polling station is closed or that polling times have changed, according to the bulletin. CBS News first\u00a0reported\u00a0on the bulletin. Like in 2020, election officials in the 2024\u00a0elections\u00a0will be operating in a chaotic and sometimes hostile information environment, in which large portions of the electorate falsely believe there is widespread fraud in the system. Former President Donald Trump recently\u00a0declined to commit\u00a0to accepting the results of the election. But unlike in 2020, AI tools present an easy way to greatly amplify false claims of electoral fraud and election conspiracy theories, according to US officials and private experts. US officials focused on election security are concerned AI tools will exacerbate this already-fraught threat environment, pointing to an incident during the Democratic primary in New Hampshire in January as an example. An AI-made robocall imitating President Joe Biden targeted voters in the primary, urging them not to vote.\u00a0A New Orleans magician made the robocall at the behest of a political consultant working for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a long-shot Democratic challenger to Biden, the\u00a0magician told CNN. AI becoming more sophisticated AI tools, however, are effective only if they gain traction with audiences. Operatives working for the Chinese and Iranian governments prepared fake, AI-generated\u00a0content\u00a0as part of\u00a0a campaign to influence US voters in the closing weeks of the 2020 election campaign,\u00a0CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0last week. The Chinese and Iranian operatives never disseminated the deepfake\u00a0audio or video publicly,\u00a0current and former officials briefed on the intelligence said. At the time, some US officials who reviewed the intelligence were unimpressed, believing it showed China and Iran lacked the capability to deploy deepfakes in a way that would seriously impact the 2020 presidential election. AI capabilities have progressed considerably in the last four years. They are easier to use and need fewer samples to convincingly imitate someone\u2019s voice or face.\u00a0As a result, the technology is proliferating among bad actors. Foreign government-backed operatives have increasingly used generative AI in their influence operations aimed at Americans, according to the new DHS bulletin.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_louisiana-house-bill-abortion-drugs-controlled-substances", "text": "The Louisiana state House on Tuesday passed an amended\u00a0bill that would classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifeprostone as Schedule IV\u00a0controlled dangerous substances\u00a0in the state, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants. The House\u2019s final passage vote was 64-29, and the bill now heads back to the Senate for concurrence. Senate Bill 276\u00a0would make it a crime to give abortion medication to a person without their consent. The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added after it passed out of the Senate. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is\u00a0already banned\u00a0in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. In a\u00a0medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug,\u00a0misoprostol,\u00a0is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades. The amended bill would make it a felony \u2013 punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 \u2013 for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription. The legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs. In Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs\u00a0carries a penalty\u00a0of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000. \u201cAbsolutely unconscionable,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X in response to the bill\u2019s House passage Tuesday night, adding, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump did this.\u201d The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cAdding abortion drugs to the\u00a0controlled substance\u00a0list should be uncontroversial. Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons\u00a0\u2013\u00a0like miscarriage care\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\u201d Caitlin Connors, the group\u2019s southern regional director, said in a news release. CNN has previously reported that the bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification. The letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \u201cneither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\u201d The letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \u201cthe false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\u201d and that they are \u201cwidely prescribed and taken safely.\u201d Pressly rebutted the letter\u2019s claims in a response he shared with CNN last week: \u201cIf enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\u201d \u201cThe doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\u201d he continued. If the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed out of the House, it will next head to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry.\u00a0If Landry were to sign the bill into law, Louisiana would become the only state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.

{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_senate-republicans-election-control", "text": "The race for the White House hogs most of the attention in a presidential election year, relegating the race for Congress to ugly stepsister status. But in recent years, we\u2019ve all learned how important down-ballot races can be in shaping American policy. That\u2019s especially true for the Senate, which is responsible for the confirmations of government officials and Supreme Court nominees. In this year\u2019s battle for the Senate, like so many cycles before, we have the same competing forces: The election fundamentals favor Republicans, while candidate quality appears to favor Democrats, who currently hold a narrow majority in the chamber. For now, though, it appears even flawed Republican candidates likely won\u2019t be able to stop their side from winning Senate control. Democrats face two \u201cM\u201d problems: the math and the map. Let\u2019s start with the math. Republicans need a net gain of one seat to win the Senate if Donald Trump wins the presidency (with his vice president casting any tie-breaking votes). They need a net gain of two seats for a majority regardless of who wins the presidential election. Republicans have a lot of options to net those one or two seats. Senate Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) hold 23 seats up for election this year; Republicans hold 11. This brings us to the map. Eight of the 23 Democratic seats up for election this year are in states either where Trump won in 2016 or where he is up by at least 5 points in the polls now. Five of them are in states where Trump holds at least a 5-point advantage. Three are in states where Trump won by at least 8 points in 2016 and 2020 and where the incumbent senator is the only Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office. One of those three is West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring. Trump won the state by 39 points in 2020, and every respectable nonpartisan handicapping outlet views the seat as a safe Republican pickup. There are only two Republican Senate seats being targeted by Democrats \u2013 Florida and Texas, which Trump carried by single digits in 2020. But the GOP incumbents in both states currently lead their Democratic opponents by double digits. Every other Republican-held Senate seat on the ballot this year is in a state where GOP presidential candidates have dominated since 2012. It\u2019s no wonder that my colleague Simone Pathe had only one Republican seat (Texas) on her most recent list of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip this year, and that was at No. 10. Positive signs for Democrats But is the race for the Senate really over if Republicans just win West Virginia? No, we can\u2019t call it just yet, and it\u2019s not just because we\u2019re still months before the general election. It\u2019s because if President Joe Biden does win \u2013 a real possibility \u2013 it\u2019s not entirely clear which second Senate seat Republicans will pick up to gain control. Among the eight Democratic Senate seats mentioned above, there are no states beyond West Virginia where the polls (or expert judgment) show Republicans with a solid lead, despite the fundamentals favoring their party this year.\u00a0Democratic Senate candidates seem to be at least tied or ahead in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Democratic Senate candidates\u2019 margins outran Biden\u2019s in the four states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 that The New York Times and Siena College recently polled. And we\u2019re not just talking by a little bit; we\u2019re talking about them doing better than Biden by at least 5 points in those four states among likely voters. A key reason the Democratic candidates are doing so much better than Biden is because they\u2019re popular. We know from recent polls that Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin had positive net favorability ratings, while Biden\u2019s numbers were well under water in these states. Meanwhile in Arizona, Republicans appear poised to nominate Kari Lake for Senate. Lake was last seen losing a very winnable gubernatorial election in 2022 and her high unfavorable score with state voters was a big reason why Inside Elections recently shifted its rating of the race in the Democratic direction. Of course, Democratic Senate candidates outrunning the top of the ticket is nothing new. Republicans have memorably lost plenty of very winnable seats over the past decade and a half with bad candidates (see 2010 with Nevada\u2019s Sharron Angle and 2012 with Missouri\u2019s Todd Akin). Two years ago, Republicans had a net loss of one Senate seat as Democrats retained control of the chamber in a midterm election when Biden had approval ratings in the low 40s. Again, the GOP ran several unpopular candidates (e.g., Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania), while Democrats ran relatively popular ones (e.g., Mark Kelly in Arizona) Back to the math and map Still, it\u2019s hard to ignore Republicans\u2019 advantage in 2024 with the math and the map. Senate Democrats have no margin for error, and they are unlikely to win all seven of their seats currently seen as competitive. The past two presidential cycles tell the tale: Just one state (Maine in 2020) voted differently in the presidential and Senate races. Trump likely holds a comfortable polling advantage of at least 5 points over Biden right now in Arizona, Nevada, Montana and Ohio. His lead in Montana is likely in the double digits. Putting aside the polls, Montana and Ohio were not competitive on the presidential level in either 2016 or 2020 and likely won\u2019t be this fall. For Democrats to have any chance of holding the Senate, Republicans would have to lose all these Senate races. Then they\u2019d have to lose in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all states that Trump could very well win again. Republicans would also have to lose in Maryland \u2013 where Biden will almost certainly win in a blowout, but where GOP former Gov. Larry Hogan has been competitive in the polling. Republicans may be prone to blowing it when it comes to Senate races. But I\u2019m not even sure the Washington Generals of Senate races can blow this one. As a memorable \u201cSimpsons\u201d episode once put it, Republicans may finally be \u201cdue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/senate-republicans-election-control/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_rudy-giuliani-arizona-election-subversion", "text": "Rudy Giuliani and 10 others pleaded not guilty in an Arizona court Tuesday to charges of allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. The former New York mayor was also ordered to post a $10,000 bond after he ducked efforts by the state to serve him with a summons over the past week. Giuliani was served Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, at his 80th\u00a0birthday bash held by a GOP operative. Arizona prosecutors spent weeks trying to track down Giuliani and eventually found him based on some of his podcasts. A grand jury in Arizona handed up indictments last month charging over a dozen Donald Trump allies for their efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, including the fake electors and several individuals connected to his campaign. Giuliani was joined by 10 other defendants entering their not-guilty pleas Tuesday. Four of those appeared virtually and six in person. The list includes: Christina Bobb, a Trump ally who now serves as the Republican National Committee\u2019s top lawyer for \u201celection integrity\u201d; former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman; and former Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward. Ex-Trump lawyer John\u00a0Eastman\u00a0pleaded not guilty last week. Six others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn and former Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis are scheduled to appear next month. While Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \u201cUnindicted Coconspirator 1.\u201d Giuliani spars with prosecutors In asking for a $10,000 cash bond along with the requirement that Giuliani appear in Arizona within a month to be processed, prosecutor Nicholas Klingerman told the judge that Giuliani \u201chas failed to reach out or be cooperative in this process.\u201d \u201cWe actually had two agents in Florida, at the time, who were sitting outside the party waiting to see if he would leave\u201d in order to serve him, Klingerman said of Giuliani\u2019s birthday party. That evening, Giuliani posted a tweet saying that \u201cif Arizona authorities can\u2019t find me by tomorrow morning\u201d they would have to dismiss the indictment. An hour after the post, Klingerman said, agents saw him leave the party and served him. \u201cI haven\u2019t been hiding from anyone,\u201d Giuliani told the judge during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI have a fair number of threats \u2026 and I don\u2019t have security any longer since I\u2019ve been in bankruptcy. So I have very specific rules,\u201d Giuliani said, explaining why agents were unable to serve him at this New York apartment. Giuliani claimed there had been attempted hits on him in France and the Netherlands and said a cash bond \u201cwould be totally punitive.\u201d \u201cI do consider this indictment a complete embarrassment to the American legal system. But I\u2019ve shown no tendency not to comply,\u201d Giuliani said, adding that he has been sued many times \u201cby a very similar movement to this one, which is the \u2018let\u2019s see what we can do to destroy Donald Trump\u2019 movement.\u201d Giuliani told the judge he didn\u2019t have counsel, claiming that he could handle the arraignment himself \u201cexcept for the fact that I don\u2019t have a copy of the indictment,\u201d and offered to give his email address before the judge reminded him that he was appearing in open court. \u201cOh,\u201d Giuliani said.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_cohen-cross-examination-2024-election", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen goes back on the stand Thursday braced for another bruising day of cross-examination that is shaping up as the most crucial chapter in the first criminal trial of a former president. Cohen is the last prosecution witness, and his testimony is a sign that the trial \u2013 arising from a hush money payment Trump allegedly made to an adult film star and efforts to cover it up \u2013 is moving swiftly toward a climax that could rock the last five months of the election. Trump\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d endured a withering grilling Tuesday, as Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche sought to puncture his credibility, portraying him as a liar obsessed with the ex-president who was raking in a fortune with his quest to bring him down. CNN\u2019s Paula Reid reported that Blanche \u2013 whose cross-examination some outside observers said was erratic and over personalized on Tuesday \u2013 will strike directly at charges that Trump ordered the payment to cover up an alleged affair to mislead voters in an early instance of election interference in 2016. (Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case). Blanche is also expected to challenge Cohen\u2019s memory of conversations with Trump. And he will seek to sow doubt within jurors\u2019 minds that a decision of such magnitude should be made on the word of Cohen alone, Reid reported. Two significant strategic questions remain unanswered. The first centers on whether the presumptive GOP nominee will testify \u2014 after initially signaling he would like to despite the view of many legal experts that he\u2019d be courting disaster on the stand. It\u2019s also unclear how many witnesses the defense will call, or whether Trump\u2019s attorneys will make a bold argument that the state of New York has failed to meet the bar of proving Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and rest their case. However things unfold, it\u2019s obvious that following summations from both sides, the jury will retire within days to consider a verdict that will effectively decide whether, for the first time in history, a major political party will nominate a convicted felon for president. A suddenly compressed political calendar Every criminal trial is a grave process since a defendant\u2019s reputation and even liberty is on the line. But this case is especially momentous, given the identity of the accused \u2014 a former president who has about a 50-50 chance to win back the White House, according to national polls. The trial is one of several critical events weighing on the destiny of the presidential race in a suddenly compressed political calendar that means voters will be wrestling with their critical choice long before Election Day in November. For instance, long-held doubts that there\u2019d be any presidential debates were dispelled Wednesday morning as President Joe Biden threw down the gauntlet in a video, telling Trump, \u201cMake my day, pal,\u201d while his campaign suggested debates in late June and early September. Biden later said he\u2019d accepted a CNN debate on June 27. Trump quickly accepted. Later that morning, both men said they\u2019d accepted an invitation from ABC for a second debate on September 10. The sudden breakthrough means that debates will take place far earlier than usual in the campaign \u2014 even before either party has officially anointed their nominee at conventions in July for the GOP and in August for the Democrats. There\u2019s some logic to the shift because voting starts in some states as early as September. But the development also means that the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which has hosted debates since 1988 and has angered both parties in recent years, now seems to be on borrowed time and is at risk of becoming the latest tradition to be swept away in the turbulent Trump era. The 81-year-old Biden\u2019s decision to take Trump on is a risk since any flubs attributable to his age could play into the ex-president\u2019s claim that he\u2019s not fit to serve a second term. Some commentators have also argued that Biden should not offer the implied legitimacy of the debate stage to a former president who has been indicted over an attempt to destroy democracy after the 2020 election. But Trump, himself 77, might have already hurt himself by setting a low bar that will allow the president to outperform expectations. The former president frequently comments outside the Manhattan courtroom, for example, that Biden can\u2019t string two sentences together. And any repeat of Trump\u2019s over-torqued performance in the first presidential debate in 2020 could validate Biden\u2019s claim he\u2019s extreme and a danger to the Constitution. Critical Supreme Court ruling Another key development that could weigh heavily on the campaign could occur at about the same time as the first debate. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver its decision on Trump\u2019s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution. High court rulings are always difficult to predict. But the signs from oral arguments on the issue last month were that the justices could send the case back to lower courts for yet more litigation. That would almost certainly delay Trump\u2019s trial in his federal election interference case until after the election, meaning he wouldn\u2019t be brought to account for the worst attack on democracy in modern times before a subsequent election. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers have long sought to delay Trump\u2019s reckoning on this and other cases until after an election that could make him president again and furnish him with powers that could allow him to halt federal trials against him. Two other cases \u2014 a state one over election interference in Georgia and a federal one arising from his hoarding of classified documents at his Florida home \u2014 have also been bogged down in pre-trial litigation and are unlikely to take place before voters choose their next president. This raises the possibility that an election long expected to be mired in Trump\u2019s legal nightmares could suddenly be dominated by a different kind of political mood music. In that case, the hush money trial may be the only one held before the election. It\u2019s impossible to predict how a guilty verdict or an acquittal would influence undecided voters in swing states who will decide the identity of the next president. Some polling suggests some Republicans might think twice about picking Trump if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the hush money case is widely considered the least serious criminal issue facing the ex-president. And Trump and his Republican supporters \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up at the courthouse Tuesday \u2014 are stepping up attempts to portray the trial as politically motivated, possibly to hedge against a possible conviction. The pre-verdict spin is another sign that a trial that\u2019s taken the country across a historic threshold may be moving toward its conclusion \u2014 at a moment when other forces that could decide the election are gathering pace.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/cohen-cross-examination-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_13_politics_questions-trump-trial-answered-what-matters", "text": "When CNN asked for your questions about former President Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial \u2013 for his role in hush money payments made before the 2016 election to women who said they had affairs with him \u2013 we got a flood of input. Not all of it was fit to print. But there were a lot of legitimate and very thoughtful questions, which we\u2019ve updated now that the defense and prosecution have both rested and jurors may begin deliberations as soon as May 28. Keep reading for a representative sampling, which helps explain the case, along with context from CNN\u2019s reporters and coverage. Most of the questions come directly from reader submissions, but for others, I\u2019ve taken the liberty of simplifying multiple submissions into one question. Trump, by the way, denies having the affairs and has pleaded not guilty in the case. I went to CNN\u2019s chief legal analyst Laura Coates for the single, most-asked question, which was asked in many ways but boils down to: Could Trump actually go to jail? Coates: If Trump were to be found guilty of all of the counts, he could theoretically be facing more than a decade in prison.\u00a0The 34 felony counts are classified as Class E felonies in New York, the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty for each of those counts is four years; however New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years.\u00a0It is within the judge\u2019s discretion to decide whether those sentences would run concurrently or consecutively. Because the crimes involve nonviolent offenses and Trump does not have a criminal record, the judge could also consider jailing him for a period that is but a fraction of the maximum penalty. Another possibility is that the judge could forego prison entirely and place him on probation with the possibility of incarceration looming over his head if he fails to abide by the conditions set by the judge. If the judge should decide to incarcerate post-conviction, Secret Service would become the elephant in the, well, cell.\u00a0The unprecedented nature of incarcerating a former president would raise questions about how best to ensure equal treatment under the law and security for a former president. Watch Coates\u2019 show weeknights at 11 p.m. ET where she\u2019ll answer a lot more of your questions. I reached out to the Secret Service to ask if they had planned for the potential that Trump could be imprisoned. Not surprisingly, I was told by a spokesman that this is \u201csomething we can not comment on at this time.\u201d But note that as a matter of US law, former presidents and their spouses are afforded lifetime Secret Service protection, unless they decline it. This is ultimately a question of strategy. But testimony in previous proceedings has not gone well for Weisselberg, the former, longtime chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. He is currently indisposed at Rikers Island, a prison in New York, where he\u2019s serving time for admitting to perjury in the civil fraud trial that ended in a more than $400 million judgement against Trump for inflating his net worth to get friendly loan terms. Prosecutors told Judge Juan Merchan they did not attempt to compel Weisselberg\u2019s testimony in this trial even though he played a crucial role in payments to Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen. Defense lawyers said Weisselberg was not available to either side for testimony and would likely invoke his Fifth Amendment rights if called. Look for jurors to be given instructions about how to view testimony they heard about Weisselberg. There is strong evidence that the campaign was in a state of panic after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in 2016. There is strong evidence from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about the desire to help Trump\u2019s campaign by finding and neutralizing damaging stories. It\u2019s clear that Cohen organized payments for Stormy Daniels, a woman who claimed an affair with Trump, and that he took out a loan to make them happen. But Cohen is the only witness who said that Trump specifically made payments to Cohen to reimburse him for the payments to Daniels. Jurors will have to believe Cohen, an admitted liar and felon, that the payments were improper reimbursement and not simply lawyer fees. A unanimous vote is required for either conviction or acquittal. Anything short of a unanimous verdict would be a hung jury. The judge will try very hard to get the jury to reach a unanimous verdict.  A hung jury might be perceived as a net win for Trump since prosecutors would have to ponder whether to try him again on the same charges and there\u2019s little chance it would happen before Election Day. The former first lady has not attended any of her husband\u2019s criminal trial, although many of Trump\u2019s political allies \u2013 senators, House members and more \u2013 have shown their support by attending some of the arguments. Trump\u2019s son with Melania, Barron Trump, graduated from high school in Florida during the trial and the judge canceled arguments that day so that the former president could attend the ceremony. Given that the trial included testimony from Daniels about her alleged affair \u2013 which Trump has denied \u2013 it is perhaps not surprising that Melania Trump would decide not to attend the proceedings. First, Trump never signed a check to Daniels, and that is a major element of the case. Cohen engineered the hush money payment when he could not get the National Enquirer to foot the bill. Cohen took out a line of credit on his apartment to come up with the cash. Trump\u2019s payments to Cohen after Trump won the White House were, according to Cohen, to pay him back for the Daniels payments, plus a bonus, and for other things like a bogus poll Cohen engineered. Second, Trump did claim to give up control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr., when he was in the White House. But the arrangement was universally criticized by ethics experts. Trump maintained his ownership stake in the business. Some of his payments to Cohen were made from accounts associated with the trust set up to hold the Trump Organization while Trump was president. Other payments were made from a personal bank account, but all the payments were processed by the Trump Organization, according to prosecutors. Trump isn\u2019t technically accused of having an affair, which he denies and which is not illegal. The hush money itself, represented by a contract between two parties, is not necessarily illegal either. Hush money was paid by the Trump-supporting publisher of the National Enquirer to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and, separately, it was paid by Cohen to Daniels. But in this case, the payments, which were intended to hide details from voters before the 2016 election, violated campaign finance law. National Enquirer\u2019s parent company admitted wrongdoing, and Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign law and served time in prison. Federal prosecutors, as a matter of Department of Justice policy, were unable to prosecute Trump for the payments when he was president and decided not to bring charges after he left office. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg then brought this case. Trump is accused of falsifying business records (a New York state crime) in an effort to use illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 campaign (a federal crime). Yes. This is an important element of the case. Falsifying business records in New York is a misdemeanor. The felony charge here is falsifying business records to further another crime. And this is where the case against Trump gets unique. The other crime is a campaign finance violation to which Cohen has already pleaded guilty. It is a state crime made a felony by furthering a federal crime. Federal prosecutors, by the way, decided not to pursue charges against Trump with regard to the campaign finance violation. Jurors heard testimony about how nervous Trump\u2019s campaign was after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was published and they desperately wanted to tamp down on any unflattering stories. Trump\u2019s defense is that he did not want the Daniels story to be published because he wanted to keep the information from his wife. Nothing about any of this is normal. Trump\u2019s stated legal strategy is to delay legal proceedings as much as possible in the hope that they do not conclude before the presidential election. It\u2019s a strategy that so far is paying off in federal court. His federal election interference case is stalled until the US Supreme Court rules on what most people consider to be a ridiculous total immunity argument. His federal trial on classified documents is on indefinite hold in Miami. His trial in Fulton County, Georgia, on state election interference allegations has been delayed by allegations of impropriety in the personal life of the DA bringing the case. This is a great and essentially unanswerable hypothetical. First, it assumes multiple things will occur: Trump would have to be convicted, sentenced, exhaust appeals, report to prison and win the election. That\u2019s a very specific scenario thrust upon a very unpredictable set of circumstances and a short timeline. I talked to Frank Bowman, a law professor emeritus at the University of Missouri who is both an expert in criminal law and published a book on the impeachment process, for his thoughts on how to deal with a convict president. The Constitution, he said, theoretically allows a person to serve \u201ceven if he\u2019s a convicted felon or even if he\u2019s a convicted felon in the joint.\u201d Timing, however, would get in the way of this hypothetical ever occurring. \u201cThis stuff takes a long time, and the appeals would drag out,\u201d probably beyond Election Day and Inauguration Day, Bowman said. It\u2019s also possible Trump\u2019s opponents, after a conviction, could try again to either impeach him or object to his presidency based on the 14th Amendment, although those avenues have been tried and failed previously. If somehow Trump was convicted in this state case, Bowman imagined there could be some argument by which the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause \u2013 which prohibits states from interfering in the exercise of constitutional powers \u2013 could be utilized to keep Trump from state prison. But it would be a novel thing. If, on the other hand, Trump was somehow convicted in one of his two federal trials and sentenced to federal prison, as president he could theoretically try to pardon himself or order the Bureau of Prisons to do something like confine him at the White House. Again, this is uncharted territory that is unanticipated in US law and, Bowman argues, unlikely to occur.

The New York Democrat called the legislation \u201ca tough, serious-minded, and \u2013 critically, bipartisan \u2013 proposal to secure our border\u201d in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. The initial package, which included tough border provisions and foreign aid to US allies, was blocked in February by the Senate amid a torrent of attacks by top House Republicans and former President Donald Trump, who is making the border a central campaign issue in his race for the White House. The Senate\u00a0passed\u00a0a separate foreign aid package last month. \u201cBack in January, the former President urged Congressional Republicans to kill the bipartisan bill, telling the world proudly to \u2018blame it on me.\u2019 The American people do not have the luxury of playing partisan blame games. They want bipartisan action to secure our border,\u201d Schumer said in the letter, which did not specify when the bill would be taken up. Schumer acknowledged that he doesn\u2019t expect all Democrats will support the stand-alone border bill \u2014 with some caucus members saying earlier this year the legislation \u201cmisses the mark.\u201d Republican leaders have already said they oppose Schumer\u2019s move to revote on the legislation, making it unlikely the bill can secure the 60 votes it would need to advance. President Joe Biden previously endorsed the border provisions, and while Trump and other Republicans have called it too weak, the bill would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict\u00a0illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The White House and top Democrats have discussed taking more action on the border ahead of the first presidential debate next month, CNN previously reported. Those plans, intended to strengthen the party\u2019s hand on a critical campaign issue ahead of the 2024 election, also potentially include a sweeping executive order limiting migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum, sources have told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_appeals-court-hunter-biden-gun-trial", "text": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected\u00a0the latest attempt\u00a0by Hunter Biden to pause his upcoming gun trial while the president\u2019s son pursues some long-shot appeals. The trial is scheduled to begin June 3 in Delaware. The quick decision came from the same three-judge panel that\u00a0previously rejected\u00a0one of Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to throw out the indictment. The panel includes one Republican-appointed judge and two Democratic appointees, including one put on the bench by Hunter Biden\u2019s father, President Joe Biden. This is one of several bids by Hunter Biden to slow down or postpone his gun trial. So far, his efforts have fallen flat, and the trial judge\u00a0hasn\u2019t shown any openness\u00a0to delaying the case. Special counsel David Weiss has\u00a0charged\u00a0Hunter Biden with illegally purchasing and possessing a gun, in violation of federal law because he was addicted to illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to the three-count indictment and claims he\u2019s being politically targeted. To prove his case, Weiss intends to present\u00a0intensely personal testimony\u00a0from witnesses who can describe Hunter Biden\u2019s longtime crack cocaine abuse, including from three former romantic partners. They include Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife and the widow of his late brother, Beau Biden. Prosecutors also said in recent court filings that they plan to present text messages showing Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to buy crack cocaine from drug dealers, as well as messages in which he fights with his family members about his inability to get sober. Much of the case revolves around Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, which he has described as a lifelong struggle. To win a conviction, prosecutors will need to convince a jury that Hunter Biden was abusing illegal drugs while he bought and briefly owned the gun in 2018. Hunter Biden\u00a0testified at a court hearing last year that he has been sober since 2019. The spate of filings and delay-attempts in the gun case comes\u00a0as Hunter Biden is preparing for a separate tax trial in California, which was also brought by Weiss\u2019 team. That trial is scheduled for late June, a few weeks after the gun case is expected to wrap up. There is a hearing set for Wednesday in Los Angeles, where the judge overseeing the tax case will weigh whether to put the proceedings\u00a0on hold. Separately on Tuesday, Weiss\u2019\u00a0team asked a judge to force\u00a0Hallie Biden\u00a0to testify in the California-based tax case.\u00a0This spat pits the Justice Department against\u00a0\ufeffthe widow of President Biden\u2019s first-born son, Beau, and the mother of two of his grandchildren. Prosecutors said in a court filing that they need a judge to compel Hallie Biden\u2019s testimony because her lawyers have made it clear that she would \u201crefuse to answer questions\u201d by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. \u201cIn the judgment of the Special Counsel, the testimony of Hallie Biden may be necessary to the public interest,\u201d Weiss\u2019 team wrote to the judge in the tax case. In\u00a0the\u00a0filing, Weiss said a top official from the\u00a0Justice Department\u2019s tax division, Stuart Goldberg, gave him authorization to try to force Hallie Biden\u2019s testimony.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial", "text": "First the fireworks, now the smoke. Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial, which began with absorbing and vivid opening statements \u2014 both from federal prosecutors and from attorneys for the New Jersey Democrat and his co-defendants \u2014 is moving into a less spectacular phase as it enters its second week Monday. Menendez, 70,\u00a0has been charged\u00a0with playing a pivotal role in a convoluted international bribery scheme involving his wife, Nadine; the governments of Egypt and Qatar; and several Garden State businessmen \u2014 including one who has already pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the federal government. Menendez and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty. But for all the talk of graft and gold bars, prosecutors must now get down to the nitty-gritty, connecting a sprawling collection of evidence and testimony \u2014 much of it still to come \u2014 for a jury that is already repeatedly hearing from defense attorneys not only that their client is innocent, but that even if he did do much of what is alleged, it wouldn\u2019t amount to a crime. Though the trial has been overshadowed by another\u00a0sordid legal drama\u00a0playing out a short walk away in New York City\u2019s Manhattan Criminal Court, Menendez has already made some history of his own: He is the only US senator ever to be indicted in two separate criminal cases. Last time around, Menendez walked after a deadlocked jury led the judge to declare a mistrial. Now, though, prosecutors feel they have a stronger case. Menendez, who \u2014 along with co-defendants Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer \u2014 has vigorously denied the charges, faces a lengthy prison sentence if convicted. The political ramifications for Menendez, who arrived in the Senate from the House in 2006, have been dire. He is not seeking reelection in next month\u2019s Democratic primary; the party is coalescing around Rep. Andy Kim as his successor, likely ending a 50-year political career, the last three decades of which Menendez has spent on Capitol Hill. Here are four big questions facing Menendez, his lawyers and federal prosecutors as the trial intensifies. Can prosecutors connect all the many, far-flung dots? They\u2019re doing their best to keep it tight. In her opening statement, Lara Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, described Menendez as a common crook with uncommon power. \u201cThis was not politics as usual. This was politics for profit,\u201d the prosecutor said.\u00a0 \u201cHe was powerful. He was also corrupt. And what was his price? Gold bars.\u201d Not long after, Pomerantz was handing out some of the gold bars Menendez is accused of receiving as bribes for jurors to touch and pass around. Getting a grip on the narrative scope of the allegations will be more difficult. Friday\u2019s slow-burn testimony took the court back more than five years, as James Bret Tate, then a diplomat based in Cairo with a focus on US agricultural interests, gave a cloak-and-dagger account \u2014 which will continue Monday \u2014 of how he came to realize Hana\u2019s threadbare company obtained a monopoly on the halal certification process for meats headed to Egypt. According to the indictment, some of that profit ultimately made its way to Menendez in the form of bribes. Prosecutors also allege that the senator, in a call to a US Department of Agriculture official, sought to protect Hana\u2019s business amid concerns over its effect on the sprawling and lucrative American beef markets. (Menendez\u2019s lawyers are expected to counter by arguing that their client was simply providing boffo \u201cconstituent services\u201d to Hana\u2019s New Jersey-based firm.) Got that? It\u2019s up to the prosecution to make sure the jury does. This, too, is only the beginning. The trial is expected to stretch on for weeks. How hard does the defense lean on Nadine Menendez? Lawyers for the senator are so far indicating a two-pronged approach to defending their client. The first is to say that he received no bribes, did no work as a foreign agent and that, though outsiders might find some of his behavior distasteful, he did not corruptly abuse his power. The other half of their telling, in short, is that Nadine Menendez was the one pulling the strings \u2014 and hiding it from her husband. (She is also charged and slated to go on trial this summer. She has pleaded not guilty.) The senator\u2019s attorney, Avi Weitzman, told the jury in his opening statement that the couple\u00a0mostly led \u201cseparate lives\u201d and \u201chad separate finances.\u201d \u201cThey even had a separate cell phone plan,\u201d Weitzman said, a fact that was included in a PowerPoint presentation accompanying his remarks. Weitzman listed \u201cfinancial concerns that (Nadine) kept from Bob,\u201d whom he described as being smitten by a \u201cbeautiful and tall, international woman.\u201d Hana\u2019s lawyer, in his opening statement, also pointed the finger at Nadine Menendez. To further complicate the dynamic, coming into view, the senator disclosed Thursday that his wife is \u201csuffering from Grade 3 breast cancer, which will require her to have mastectomy surgery.\u201d Though it was previously known that she faced a \u201cserious medical condition,\u201d the specifics only emerged late last week \u2014 on the morning after the senator\u2019s attorney asserted that she was a driving force behind some of his client\u2019s alleged crimes. What will the Menendez team admit and what will they contest? \u201cYou might not like it, but it is not a crime.\u201d Weitzman, in those opening remarks, acknowledged that the senator\u2019s alleged behavior might not live up to one\u2019s high ideals of good government. Menendez backed his constituents, the lawyer said, and some of those constituents were friends. But playing favorites \u2014 one of the halal certification companies that got squeezed out of the market by Hana is also based in New Jersey \u2014 is not necessarily a felony offense. Nor, Weitzman suggested, is a phone call to an administrative official about a constituent\u2019s business anything unusual, much less criminal, and it certainly \u2014 he implied \u2014 doesn\u2019t rise to the level of an \u201cofficial act.\u201d More details about Menendez\u2019s conversation with a top Department of Agriculture official, in which he allegedly pushed for the agency to quit a process that could have threatened Hana\u2019s monopoly, will be discussed in the coming days. The particulars of their call remain unknown to the public, though the USDA official and perhaps others are expected to testify about the matter. What those witnesses say, and how (and whether) the prosecution argues that Menendez, in this incident, broke the law \u2014 a bar increasingly difficult to clear, per recent US Supreme Court precedent relating to corruption \u2014 could make or break a key component of the case. Will Republicans try to seize on this? At all? Republicans have been surprisingly absent from the hoopla around the Menendez trial. In fairness, there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot of it, at least in comparison with what one might expect. Or might have expected if former President Donald Trump, on trial down the block, were not such a magnet for self-promoting \u2014 and self-preserving \u2014 GOP leaders. Again, Menendez is a powerful longtime Democratic US senator accused of staggering corruption, including selling out national security information to a foreign government. New Jersey is a deep shade of blue, but its Democratic governor very nearly lost his reelection bid in 2021, and this November is likely to feature an open-seat race to succeed Menendez. (The senator has said he would consider running as an independent if exonerated.) But national Republicans have not sought to make hay out of the allegations or put a spotlight on the trial. Or tried, at the very least, to expand the battleground Senate campaign map and make Democrats play defense on what is \u2014 and yes, likely remains \u2014 their home turf. This dynamic could change later this week or next when Trump\u2019s trial is expected to reach its denouement. But for now, Menendez and this trial seem destined to remain on the national political back burner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_mar-a-lago-documents-walt-nauta-donald-trump", "text": "Months before Donald Trump was indicted for mishandling classified documents, a federal judge said that investigators had \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the former president \u201cintended\u201d to hide classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago\u00a0resort, according to newly released court documents. Judge Beryl Howell cited, among other things, the discovery of additional\u00a0classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago months after the FBI\u2019s search of the property in the summer of 2022. The records included a\u00a0\u201cmostly empty\u201d folder marked as\u00a0\u201cClassified Evening Summary\u201d that was found in the former president\u2019s bedroom, as well as four other documents with classification markings found in his post-presidential office at the resort. \u201cNotably, no excuse is provided as to how the former president could miss the classified-marked documents found in his own bedroom at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Howell\u00a0wrote in March 2023. The ruling was among hundreds of pages of previously sealed filings that were publicly docketed Tuesday in the criminal classified documents case against Trump. Included as well were new images of Walt Nauta, Trump\u2019s personal aide, moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago room before the a Trump attorney was to review the boxes for classified materials sought by a subpoena. Prosecutors say\u00a0Nauta moved boxes around as part of an alleged conspiracy to conceal classified material from federal investigators. Nauta has been charged alongside Trump and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira in the case, facing charges of mishandling sensitive or classified materials and obstruction.\u00a0 All three have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. The photos of Nauta, which appear to be screenshots of surveillance footage, are dated June 1, 2022 \u2013 shortly before the Trump attorney was slated to canvass the storage room for any documents with classified markings to be returned to the federal government. The case against Trump, brought last summer, is currently in front of Judge Aileen Cannon in Fort Pierce, Florida. Cannon is a Trump appointee. Judge said that Trump used his attorney as a \u2018front man\u2019 to obstruct probe Trump\u2019s defense team is seeking to throw out parts of the prosecutors\u2019 case \u2013 including all the evidence seized from Mar-a-Lago and obtained from his former attorney Evan Corcoran, according to the filings in federal court in South Florida. Trump\u2019s team argues that the warrant for the search wasn\u2019t valid because of the way an FBI agent described the agency\u2019s thinking to a magistrate judge. They are also contesting Howell\u2019s 2023 ruling ordering\u00a0Corcoran to provide testimony and produce documents that he had previously withheld from the grand jury investigating the matter. Howell, an appointee of Barack Obama, said at the time that prosecutors had\u00a0\u201csufficient evidence to show that the former president\u201d used Corcoran as \u201ca \u2018front m[a]n\u2019 to obstruct the government\u2019s investigation and perpetuate the former president\u2019s unlawful retention of any classified documents contained in boxes transferred from the White House.\u201d Corcoran played a pivotal role in the investigation into the classified documents, as he was the attorney who was tasked with finding and producing documents with classified markings at Trump\u2019s Florida resort. In the criminal case filed last year, prosecutors say there was conspiracy led by Trump to move boxes of government records from the storage room before Corcoran searched for it for classified materials. Corcoran is referred to as \u201cPerson 18\u201d in Howell\u2019s ruling but can be identified based on what\u2019s known about the case. Among the topics Howell ordered Corcoran to testify about was a June 24, 2022, phone call he had with Trump \u2013 the same day investigators subpoenaed surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0She also ordered the production of 88 documents that had been withheld under attorney-client privilege. Howell\u00a0recounted Trump\u2019s actions over the course of several months while the federal government sought to retrieve the sensitive documents taken from the\u00a0White House. Trump \u201cdeliberately curtailed his staff\u2019s efforts to comply\u201d with the National Archives\u2019\u00a0initial efforts to retrieve the documents, she wrote. \u201cThe former president\u2019s misdirection of NARA was apparently a dress rehearsal for his actions in response to the May 11, 2022 subpoena,\u201d Howell said. Twenty-one of the 32 national security documents Trump is accused of criminally mishandling were in the former president\u2019s possession August 8, 2022, the date of the Mar-a-Lago FBI search. That means that Trump\u2019s team in this newly available motion to suppress is seeking to cut out from the case those 21 documents\u2013and thus their related charges\u2013and the hundreds of other classified records around them, plus the part of the case accusing Trump of obstruction of justice that is built around Corcoran. Guidelines for FBI\u2019s search at Mar-a-Lago unsealed Also unsealed Tuesday was a law enforcement document outlining how the FBI was authorized to search Mar-a-Lago. The document, called a law enforcement operations order, explains what agents were permitted to bring with them when they searched Trump\u2019s estate and how they were allowed to operate as part of the search. It also includes boilerplate language from the\u00a0Justice Department manual\u00a0about use of force, including the limited circumstances in which agents are authorized to use deadly force. Though the language is standard and directly from the department\u2019s manual, Trump quickly took to social media Tuesday to decry the 2022 document as having \u201cauthorized\u201d deadly force. \u201cWOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the \u2018Icebox,\u2019 and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\u201d Trump said in a\u00a0post on Truth Social. \u201cNOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE, THAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. HE IS MENTALLY UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE \u2014 25TH AMENDMENT!\u201d \u201cThe FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. Much of the plan includes traditional practices by the FBI when executing a warrant \u2013 like how agents are required to have their standard issued weapon, ammunition and credentials while on duty. Other parts, however, show the lengths that the bureau went to to accommodate the former president, including instructions for commanding agents to wear \u201cunmarked polo or collared shirts\u201d and to keep their \u201claw enforcement equipment concealed,\u201d as well as references to their efforts to coordinate with US Secret Service to create a smooth process for entering the Florida club.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_biden-fundraising-april", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s political operation raised $51 million in April \u2013 a significant decline from its March fundraising, according to totals released by his campaign Monday. Biden\u2019s campaign and affiliated committees still ended the month with $192 million in the bank, according to his aides \u2014 a war chest they described as the highest cash-on-hand figure for any Democratic candidate in history and one they say positions the president to compete effectively with former President Donald Trump. Trump aides announced earlier this month that he had raised more than $76 million for his campaign and allied committees in April. The presumptive GOP nominee has ramped up his joint fundraising operation with the Republican National Committee and headlined high-dollar fundraisers, even as he spends parts of his week on trial in a Manhattan criminal court. Biden\u2019s political operation announced raising more than $90 million in March, bookended by a fiery State of the Union speech at the start of that month and a high-profile fundraiser in New York at the month\u2019s end that featured him with two of his predecessors, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. In a statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president\u2019s fundraising performance was \u201cespecially remarkable when you consider he has been confined to a courtroom for nearly 9 hours a day over the past four weeks.\u201d The money he\u2019s raised in April \u2013 along with polling \u2013 show \u201cthe momentum is 100% on President Trump\u2019s side,\u201d Leavitt said. Fundraising has been one of the bright spots for Biden\u2019s campaign as he battles persistently low poll numbers and faces close contests in key battleground states, and the latest figures are sure to cause consternation among Democrats. But Trump\u2019s filings also highlight potential trouble spots for his campaign: His operation continues to spend heavily on helping the former president confront his legal troubles and relatively modestly on the day-to-day business of campaigning. On Monday, Biden\u2019s aides took pains to try to cast the slower fundraising pace in a better light, pointing to what they said were signs of enduring small-dollar support and organizational strength. In a statement, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the April haul reflected \u201cstrong consistent grassroots enthusiasm for reelecting\u201d Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. She said Trump\u2019s campaign \u201ccontinues to burn through cash\u201d and has \u201cno ground game.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign said April was the strongest month for recurring donors so far, with those contributors giving more than $5.5 million. They also said the campaign added a million more supporters to its email lists last month. The Biden team said it has used its money to build a ground operation with more than 150 offices and more than 500 staffers across key battleground states. Monday was the deadline for presidential campaigns and the national political parties to file monthly reports on fundraising and spending with federal election regulators, but the joint fundraising committees that each White House candidate relies on to bring in funds don\u2019t have to file their disclosures with the Federal Election Commission until July. Trump\u2019s campaign aides have not released cash-on-hand totals for all the committees affiliated with his election effort, but his campaign report, filed Monday night, shows it ended April with $49.1 million remaining in the bank, only modestly better than the $45.1 million the campaign had in its war chest at the end of March. Biden\u2019s campaign ended April with $84.5 million remaining in its coffers, a significant advantage over Trump\u2019s war chest. Still, the gap between the two campaigns has narrowed some since March. Trump\u2019s legal troubles continue to drain his resources and time. The new filings show that Trump\u2019s leadership PAC, Save America, spent $3.3 million on legal fees in April and ended the month with about $1.1 million in outstanding legal bills. The PAC has spent about $15.6 million on legal fees this year alone, and nearly $80 million on those expenses since the start of 2021. The biggest payments in April \u2013 more than $900,000 \u2013 went to Robert & Robert, the firm that represented Trump and his family in the business fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. It was followed by more than $850,000 paid last month to the firm of Todd Blanche, the lead attorney handling Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York. The PAC ended the month still owing another $837,000 to Blanche\u2019s firm. To help pay the legal bills, Save America has taken back money it donated before Trump was a candidate to a Trump-aligned super PAC, called MAGA Inc. In April, MAGA Inc. refunded another $2.75 million to Save America, once again diverting funds that could be used to help boost Trump candidacy to underwrite lawyers\u2019 fees. MAGA Inc. raised nearly $12.8 million last month, boosted by a $10 million contribution from banking heir Timothy Mellon, who has also emerged as a major benefactor of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s independent White House bid. In all, Mellon has donated $25 million to the pro-Trump group, FEC records show. Both major presidential candidates have been hitting the money-raising circuit in recent weeks. Biden is slated to appear at a Los Angeles fundraiser next month with Obama and actors George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Monday\u2019s filings also high\ufefflighted how a handful of wealthy people has provided financial support to Kennedy\u2019s long-shot run. American Values 2024, a pro-Kennedy super PAC, took in $5\u00a0million\u00a0last month from Mellon \u2013\u00a0or\u00a0more than\u00a080%\u00a0of all the funds it raised in April. With his latest donation, Mellon has given the pro-Kennedy group a total of $25 million to date \u2013 prompting criticism from Democrats concerned about Kennedy\u2019s potential role as a spoiler in the close contest between Biden and Trump. \u201cMAGA Republicans are hellbent on propping up RFK Jr. to be a spoiler for Trump in this race,\u201d Democratic National Committee spokesman Matt Corridoni said in a statement Monday. \u201cThis is even more proof that a vote for RFK Jr. is a vote for Trump.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, raised about $10.7 million in April \u2013\u00a0most of which came in the form of an $8 million\u00a0contribution from his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley patent attorney.

With the\u00a0agreement,\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0is\u00a0forfeiting a yearslong verbal and legal battle he\u2019s waged with the\u00a0election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss. It also gives the\u00a0women\u00a0significant power to hold him accountable if Giuliani again publicly suggests they stole votes to hurt\u00a0former President Donald\u00a0Trump, which is not true.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial", "text": "Hunter Biden is once again trying to delay his fast-approaching trial on felony gun charges, which is scheduled to begin in two weeks. The president\u2019s son has already tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to postpone the proceedings, which are expected to kick off June 3 at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. His lawyers on Monday asked a federal appeals court to rehear his bid to throw out the indictment. A three-judge panel unanimously\u00a0rejected his appeal\u00a0earlier this month, but he\u2019s now asking for the full 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. Biden\u2019s legal team also asked the 3rd Circuit to pause any trial proceedings while it considers his new appeal petitions. \u201cThere is no urgency in having an immediate trial of Robert Hunter Biden, but the district court is pressing forward with a June 3, 2024 trial and imposing all the pretrial burdens that come with that,\u201d his lawyers wrote in the filing. The special counsel prosecutors who charged Biden claim he illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which allegedly violated federal law because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts. He is also challenging the constitutionality of the gun statute at the heart of the case and has alleged the charges were politically motivated. In addition to the gun case, Biden is facing a federal tax indictment in California. He is also pursuing appeals in that case and\u00a0trying to delay\u00a0that trial, which is scheduled to begin in late June after the expected conclusion of the gun trial. Special counsel David Weiss filed both cases against President Joe Biden\u2019s son \u2013 the first-ever criminal prosecutions against the child of the sitting US president. Weiss was previously the Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware but was elevated to special counsel status last year by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee. Prosecutors say 3 Hunter Biden exes to testify about his addiction at trial Weiss plans to present extremely personal testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s drug addiction from three of his former romantic partners, according to a filing Monday evening. In the filing, prosecutors described some of their key witnesses\u00a0and\u00a0what they plan to say on the stand, and they also released text messages and photos that they plan to show to the jury. These revelations about Weiss\u2019 trial strategy and witness list underscore the extremely personal nature of this case, which will shine a national spotlight on what Hunter Biden has said was his rock bottom and allow Weiss the chance to prove in court that Hunter Biden was abusing drugs when he owned the gun. The expected prosecution witnesses include Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife\u00a0Kathleen Buhle;\u00a0his late brother\u2019s widow, whom he later also dated,\u00a0Hallie Biden; and\u00a0Lunden Roberts, an Arkansas native who has a daughter with Hunter Biden.\u00a0The filings don\u2019t identify the women by name, but Weiss\u2019 description of their testimony matches other public details and court filings from related cases. Prosecutors say one witness,\u00a0who CNN has identified as Hallie Biden, will testify that Hunter Biden possessed the revolver in 2018 and that she took it from his car and threw it in a dumpster near a grocery store in Wilmington, Delaware. Prosecutors said in the filing that another witness,\u00a0who appears to be Roberts, will testify that she \u201cobserved the defendant using crack cocaine frequently \u2014 every 20 minutes except when he slept.\u201d The filing also includes scores of text messages they say are from Hunter Biden, including images of drugs,\u00a0as well as\u00a0messages about sobriety and meeting with drug dealers. Other witnesses prosecutors will call include federal agents and\u00a0the gun store\u00a0employee\u00a0who allegedly sold Hunter Biden the pistol in 2018. Hunter Biden wants judge to prohibit testimony about his \u2018alleged extravagant lifestyle\u2019 at trial Hunter Biden wants to block prosecutors from presenting testimony at his gun trial about his \u201calleged extravagant lifestyle,\u201d as they did in his\u00a0separate tax indictment\u00a0in which they described his past spending sprees on luxury cars, strippers, escorts and drugs while he struggled with addiction, his attorneys wrote in a filing earlier in the day. \u201cAny reference to this issue \u2026 would not be relevant to the issues or charges in the Delaware gun case and would be prejudicial beyond any probative value and pose a danger of confusing the issues and misleading the jury,\u201d his lawyers wrote. They proposed witnesses could be directed to stick to the bare bones of the facts and not delve into salacious details. They wrote: \u201cFor example, a witness who testifies to meeting Mr. Biden at a hotel room or having dinner with him, should not be asked such questions as whether the hotel room or meal was extravagant, or how much the hotel room or meal cost.\u201d The filing was part of the routine pretrial maneuvering by both sides in a criminal case. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ultimately gets to decide what can be presented to the jury. Biden\u2019s legal team also wants the judge to prevent prosecutors from telling jurors in the Delaware gun trial that he is facing a separate tax indictment in California. Lawyers for the president\u2019s son also want to make sure that the jury doesn\u2019t hear about his\u00a0paternity dispute\u00a0with Roberts. The attorneys said Weiss was unlikely to bring up the paternity dispute at the gun trial, but they asked the judge anyway to formally make it out of bounds. Biden initially denied paternity, but a DNA test confirmed he was the girl\u2019s father. The parents later fought over child-support payments and settled the matter last year. The saga put President Biden in an uncomfortable spot, and he publicly\u00a0acknowledged his granddaughter\u00a0for the first time last summer. Roberts, who lives in Arkansas with her daughter, and her attorney Clint Lancaster have both been subpoenaed to also potentially\u00a0testify at Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0later\u00a0tax trial in California, Lancaster told CNN. They previously cooperated with Weiss\u2019 investigation, and the indictment described payments from Biden to Roberts that were part of his alleged tax-evasion scheme. Their subpoenas were first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. What both sides want to ask potential jurors Jury selection in the Delaware gun case is scheduled to begin June 3. During the process, Biden and Weiss want to ask potential jurors about heated political topics such as the 2024 election and gun rights, according to a court filing. The opposing sides submitted a joint filing to the judge with a list of questions they agree should be posed to potential jurors. The judge gets the final say on which questions are asked. They want to know whether potential jurors think Biden \u201cis being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President\u201d and whether jurors think he is being protected from prosecution for \u201cother crimes\u201d because his father is the president. Biden\u2019s team has argued he is being unfairly targeted because of his famous political family, while some GOP critics claim he\u2019s getting soft treatment because of his father. Both sides also want to know whether potential jurors are closely following the 2024 election, whether they donate to any politicians, or whether they have participated in any campaigns. And they want to know whether members of the jury pool can still be \u201cfair and impartial\u201d despite paying attention to the election. In addition, they want to ask whether potential jurors have ever bought a gun and how they feel about various restrictions on gun possession. One of the proposed questions says: \u201cDo you have any strong views about gun ownership in this country, the gun lobby, or the Second Amendment?\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_michigan-elections-voting-changes", "text": "This year, voting will be far easier for Michigan residents \u2013 thanks to new laws that establish early voting, automatically send out absentee ballots to voters who requested them and mandate that every community has least one drop box in which to return those ballots. But the changes have made running elections in this crucial presidential battleground much harder \u2013 leading some to worry about burnout among the state\u2019s more than 1,500 local clerks, who must juggle increasingly complex election responsibilities with other duties, ranging from town record-keeping to licensing pets. \u201cWe just put a Ferrari engine inside a Model T car,\u201d Michael Siegrist, the clerk of Canton Township, said of the sweeping effort to modernize elections in a state that still conducts balloting under a decades-old, hyperlocal system. The scramble to implement Michigan\u2019s new voting rules also comes in a highly charged climate under which a simple mishap could fuel fresh \u2013 and false \u2013 conspiracy theories about election fraud. In the 2020 general election, human error in the Republican stronghold of Antrim County in northern Michigan briefly led to the unofficial results showing Joe Biden ahead when Donald Trump had won the county. Despite assurances from state and local election officials that no foul play was involved, the situation quickly spiraled, with Trump allies attempting to cast doubts about Biden\u2019s victory by making meritless claims that tabulators had switched votes from Trump to Biden. The state\u2019s highly decentralized system of administering voting means that \u201cMichigan has 1,500 elections every big election day,\u201d said Kyle Whitney, the city clerk of Marquette in the state\u2019s Upper Peninsula. That helps ensure that balloting and vote-counting is secure because it\u2019s impossible, he said, to \u201cdo one thing en masse that could influence the election on a large scale.\u201d \u201cThat said, the drawback is that we have 1,500 local clerks running elections, and we are much more likely to have \u2026 dumb mistakes because clerks are undertrained or overtired,\u201d Whitney said. The changes are also playing out at a time of higher turnover in the field \u2013 as election officials leave their jobs because they have either reached retirement age or face heavier workloads or can no longer tolerate the threats and abuse directed at them since the 2020 election. A recent national survey of election officials by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice found that 1 in 5 said they were unlikely to stay in their posts through the 2026 midterm elections. \u2018We\u2019re all beginners\u2019 The new rules in Michigan flow from a constitutional amendment that state voters approved by a wide margin in 2022 that dramatically expanded access to voting. For the first time, Michigan now requires nine days of early, in-person voting. The voter-approved amendment also allows Michiganders to sign up to automatically receive absentee ballots for all future elections. Each community must also have at least one secure ballot drop box, and larger communities must have one for every 15,000 people. Additionally, the new rules give absentee voters until 5 p.m. on the Friday after the election to fix any clerical errors on their ballots. Ballots cast by military and overseas voters, meanwhile, must now be counted if received within six days after the election, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. The 2022 voter amendment, known as Prop 2, built on a constitutional amendment approved in 2018 that allowed any Michigander to apply to vote absentee without needing an excuse. The earlier amendment also established that residents could register to vote on Election Day. The broad changes have led to a significant workload expansion for the mix of appointed and elected city and town clerks who oversee voting in the Wolverine State. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like running three separate elections now,\u201d Lori Miller, the clerk for Livonia in the Detroit suburbs, said of her new responsibilities. Miller was elected to succeed the previous, term-limited clerk and is overseeing her first presidential election. She previously served as the town\u2019s deputy clerk. Like other Michigan officials, Miller witnessed the drama that engulfed the 2020 election. At one point, Republicans on the board responsible for signing off on that year\u2019s results in Wayne County, which includes Detroit and Livonia, initially refused to certify Biden\u2019s win. They relented several hours later. But Miller said she felt she owed it to the community where she has lived all her life to take on the role, despite the challenges.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not a job you can learn in 30 days,\u201d she said. Deborah Pellow, the part-time clerk of rural Tilden Township in the Upper Peninsula, is also overseeing her first presidential election this year. Pellow has had a long public service career, serving as township treasurer and supervisor along with a decadelong stint as a county commissioner, along with other roles. But, she said, \u201cthis is the hardest and most time-consuming of all the positions I have ever held in the last 30-plus years\u201d as she balances the election demands with other responsibilities, which include bookkeeping, communications and grant-writing for this community of a little more than 1,000 people. Pellow earns $10,800 a year and said she is working double the hours she initially planned to keep up with her duties. Even longtime clerks say the learning curve has been steep. Although voters approved the new rules in November 2022, the state Legislature needed to pass legislation to make them law. That was finalized in July 2023, leaving just a few months for the state to roll out the changes \u2013 including a suite of new software \u2013 before Michigan\u2019s February 27 presidential primary. Siegrist, the clerk in Canton, said the time crunch was so intense that he learned the new electronic poll books required for early voting just two hours before he had to train poll workers how to use them. \u201cI exited 2022 feeling like an expert in election administration and process and procedure,\u201d said Siegrist, an elected Democrat who has served as township clerk since 2016. \u201cNow, I\u2019m a beginner, and what\u2019s hard is we\u2019re all beginners,\u201d he added. The February primary was like \u201cdrinking from the firehose,\u201d according to Adam Wit, the clerk of Harrison Township \u2013 a community of some 23,000 people about 25 miles northeast of Detroit. Wit, a Republican, was first elected in 2012. \u201cThere was new information, new policies, new procedures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut failure doesn\u2019t work, so clerks just spent the time, whether it was extra hours on the weekend or long days,\u201d to carry out the election. Officials with Promote the Vote \u2013 the coalition of voting and civil rights groups and individuals behind Michigan\u2019s 2018 and 2020 referenda \u2013 said state voters delivered a clear mandate that the election system now must deliver on. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that all of these pro-voter changes have created a lot of work for clerks,\u201d said Shira Roza, the group\u2019s election protection director. \u201cWe are so grateful to them.\u201d But, she added, \u201cMichiganders have a fundamental right to vote. \u2026 That isn\u2019t very meaningful if you don\u2019t have an opportunity to cast a ballot, and voting on Election Day doesn\u2019t work for everyone.\u201d Clerks \u2018will get it done\u2019 State officials say they have worked hard to train and support clerks, including with $30 million in one-time grant money to help them implement the new laws. A pilot program last fall gave some clerks the chance to experiment with the new rules and technology ahead of the primary. Angela Benander, a spokeswoman for Michigan\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, Joycelyn Benson, said the agency is also urging legislators to provide additional funding to help clerks carry out their responsibilities moving forward. Ann Arbor City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry, who is president of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks, said her group is also advocating that local governments increase salaries and staff to help clerks navigate the changes and compensate them adequately for the additional work. Benander and the clerks interviewed by CNN said February\u2019s balloting in the presidential primary went smoothly in the end. The next big test for Michigan comes in August, when voters cast primary ballots for congressional, state and local offices. \u201cWe are confident that the clerks who are always so professional and dedicated to their jobs will get it done,\u201d Benander said. Pellow, the clerk in Tilden, agreed, saying her job is to help people vote \u201canyway we can,\u201d no matter the trials. \u201cThe people of the state of Michigan voted for this,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s more work or not, we have to live with that. As I tell my workers, \u2018We\u2019re going to put a smile on our face and thank people for voting because that\u2019s what we are here to do.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/michigan-elections-voting-changes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_03_11_politics_hur-report-investigation-what-matters", "text": "Special counsel Robert Hur, who spent a year investigating the discovery of classified material at President Joe Biden\u2019s former office and Delaware home, is back in the news. The White House, citing executive privilege, has refused to hand over to House Republicans recordings of Biden talking with Hur as well as with his ghostwriter. Transcripts of Biden\u2019s deposition by Hur have already been released. Still, Republicans on Capitol Hill are moving to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas for the recordings. Hur\u2019s key recommendation \u2013 that Biden not be prosecuted for his handling of material when he was a private citizen \u2013 was overshadowed when Hur released his report in February because the special counsel described the president as a sympathetic elderly man with memory problems. Biden fired back against Hur\u2019s note that he was not charged in part because a jury could potentially see him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d \u201cI am well-meaning. And I\u2019m an elderly man. And I know what the hell I\u2019m doing,\u201d Biden said. Here\u2019s more on Hur, his report and the fallout: Who is Robert Hur? Hur was appointed by then-President Donald Trump as US attorney in Maryland in 2017. During his tenure as a federal prosecutor, which ended in 2021, he prosecuted Baltimore\u2019s then-mayor, Catherine Pugh, in a scandal involving sales of her children\u2019s book. In 2023, Hur was brought back from private practice and appointed to investigate the discovery of classified material at Biden\u2019s former office and Delaware home by Garland. The selection of a Trump-appointed former US attorney was meant to help inoculate the inquiry from allegations of political influence. What did Hur find? Hur issued a 345-page report in February, 15 months after classified material was first found in Biden\u2019s former office. Although investigators found material with classified markings and classified material within Biden\u2019s private notebooks, Hur concluded the \u201cevidence is not strong enough to establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d When did all of this happen? For context, the material was first found in Biden\u2019s office at a time when the handling of classified material was very much in the news because of Trump\u2019s refusal to return classified material to the National Archives. The timeline goes something like this: August 2022: FBI searches Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida estate, as part of its yearslong effort to reclaim classified material that had been taken from the White House by the former president. September 2022: Speaking on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Biden responds to the Trump classified documents scandal and wonders \u201chow anyone can be that irresponsible.\u201d These words will not age well. November 2022: Classified material is discovered at the president\u2019s Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement office, a Washington, DC, think tank where Biden spent time after eight years in the Obama administration. The FBI opens an investigation one week later. Later that month, Jack Smith is appointed as special counsel to oversee multiple Trump-related investigations, including the one regarding classified documents. December 2022: Biden\u2019s personal lawyers find more classified material in his Delaware garage and inform the FBI, which dispatches agents, but does not complete a comprehensive search. January 2023: Additional classified documents are discovered in Biden\u2019s Delaware home by his lawyers. CNN first reports on the discovery of material at Penn Biden Center. Hur is appointed as special counsel. He\u2019ll spend the next year conducting his investigation, which includes interviews with 147 witnesses, including Biden. How was the material first discovered? Biden\u2019s personal lawyers found it. As part of an effort to move material out of the Penn Biden Center, one of his personal attorneys looked through boxes of documents found in a closet. One box included an envelope that read \u201cEyes Only\u201d for the vice president. The word \u201cIran\u201d was written on the front. Biden\u2019s lawyers called the White House counsel\u2019s office, which called the National Archives. Within a week, the FBI had opened an investigation. What kind of classified material did Biden have? Most of what Hur describes has to do with US policy toward Afghanistan. Biden, as vice president, was opposed to a surge of US troops into Afghanistan in 2009. Former President Barack Obama decided to go forward with the surge anyway. Biden wrote a memo to Obama in 2009 arguing against the surge, and both the memo and material with classified markings related to the surge were found by the FBI in an unsecured box in Biden\u2019s Delaware garage and in his home office. Separately, investigators found notebooks with classified material in Biden\u2019s handwriting in his Delaware home office and den. Is that all the classified material? No. Additional classified material was found in November 2022 in Biden\u2019s office near the Capitol building at the Penn Biden Center. It was actually the discovery of this material that initially set off a search for classified documents in Biden\u2019s home. There is not as much detail in Hur\u2019s report on these documents, which total 44 pages sprinkled in boxes with nonclassified documents on everything from a 2011 ski trip to the Biden family genealogy. Some documents are concerned with the Obama-era agreement to limit Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Others had to do with a phone call between Biden and Ukraine\u2019s prime minister at the time, as well as US policy in Iraq. Did Biden know that he had classified material? That\u2019s a key question since it is the \u201cwillful\u201d mishandling of classified material as a former vice president for which Biden could have been prosecuted. Much of the classified material is in the form of handwritten notecards and notebooks, although Hur cites the actions of previous presidents, including Ronald Reagan, to say that Biden could \u201cargue plausibly\u201d he thought he had the ability to keep such things in his home. While Hur documents one instance in which Biden refers to finding classified material during a conversation with the ghostwriter of one of his memoirs, other times the president skips over reading aloud things he thinks might be classified. But, according to Hur, there are moments when Biden does read nearly verbatim classified material to his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer. How do we know what exactly Biden told his ghostwriter? Zwonitzer recorded and transcribed their conversations. In fact, after he learned of the appointment of Hur as special counsel, Zwonitzer deleted the recordings, although he kept the transcripts and gave them to the FBI. The FBI was ultimately able to retrieve the deleted recordings. Hur considered prosecuting Zwonitzer with obstruction for deleting the recordings but ultimately decided there would not be enough evidence to obtain a conviction. Why did Hur decide not to prosecute Biden? Hur concludes that Biden \u201cwillfully\u201d retained classified material, but also that there is not enough evidence to establish Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There are a variety of reasons for this conclusion. For starters, Hur notes that by quickly notifying the government after the documents were discovered, some jurors would be convinced the president made an innocent mistake. Plus, there are the aforementioned problems with Biden\u2019s memory, both when he was interviewed by the special counsel and during his interactions with Zwonitzer. Hur concludes that even if Department of Justice policies allowed for the prosecution of a sitting president, he would recommend against prosecuting Biden. Why is Trump being prosecuted for mishandling classified data while Biden is not? Hur explains this in his report, arguing there are important distinctions between the two cases and \u201caggravating facts\u201d in the case of Trump. From Hur\u2019s report: Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview. and in other ways cooperated with the investigation. Will that kind of explanation from a special counsel satisfy Republicans who routinely allege a double standard at the Department of Justice? It will not.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_sources-say-they-were-duped-by-egypt-changing-ceasefire-terms-for-hamas", "text": "Egyptian intelligence quietly changed the terms of a ceasefire\u00a0proposal that Israel had already signed off on earlier this month, ultimately scuttling a deal that could have released Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and set a pathway to temporarily end the fighting in Gaza, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The\u00a0ceasefire agreement\u00a0that Hamas\u00a0ended up announcing on May 6 was not what the Qataris or the Americans believed had been submitted to Hamas for\u00a0a potential final review, the sources said. The changes made by Egyptian intelligence, the details of which have not been previously reported, led to a wave of\u00a0anger and recrimination among officials from the US, Qatar and Israel, and left ceasefire talks at an impasse. \u201cWe were all duped,\u201d\u00a0one of those sources\u00a0told CNN. CIA Director Bill\u00a0Burns,\u00a0who\u00a0has spearheaded the American efforts to broker\u00a0a\u00a0ceasefire agreement, was in the region when word reached him that the Egyptians had changed the terms of the deal. Burns was angry and embarrassed,\u00a0the same person said, believing it made him look like he wasn\u2019t in the loop or hadn\u2019t informed the Israelis of the changes. The soft-spoken and mild-mannered Burns \u201calmost blew a gasket,\u201d\u00a0said the source. A CIA spokesperson declined to comment. The three sources familiar with the matter told CNN that a senior Egyptian intelligence official named Ahmed Abdel Khalek was responsible for making the changes. Abdel Khalek is a senior deputy to the Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel,\u00a0who has been Burns\u2019 counterpart in leading Egypt\u2019s mediation in the ceasefire talks. One\u00a0source\u00a0familiar with the negotiations said Abdel Khalek told the Israelis one thing and Hamas another. More of Hamas\u2019 demands were inserted into\u00a0the original framework that Israel had tacitly agreed to in order to secure Hamas\u2019 approval, the source said.\u00a0But the other mediators were not informed; nor, critically, were the Israelis. \u201cHamas was telling their people,\u00a0\u2018We will have a deal in place tomorrow,\u2019\u201d the first source said. \u201cAll sides were under the assumption the Egyptians provided the same document\u201d that Israel had signed off on and the other mediators, the US and Qatar, were aware of,\u00a0the person said. Instead, the second source said, the Egyptians sought to blur the lines between the original framework and Hamas\u2019s response. The Egyptian government did not respond to a request for comment. A deal was close at hand A Hamas document obtained by CNN outlining the version of the framework they agreed to included achieving a permanent ceasefire and a \u201csustainable calm\u201d to be reached in the second phase of the three-stage deal. Israel has been averse to agreeing to discuss an end to the war before Hamas has been defeated and the remaining hostages are released from captivity. Now,\u00a0three\u00a0weeks later, with ceasefire talks stalled, those involved are raising questions about the motives of Egypt, which\u00a0for years\u00a0has served as a key intermediary between\u00a0Israel\u00a0and Hamas, particularly Hamas members inside Gaza. Asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday if he was concerned about Egypt being involved with future ceasefire talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel was not prepared to agree to terms that would allow Hamas to attack Israel again. \u201cI hope Egypt understands that we can\u2019t agree to something like that.\u201d The changes\u00a0came\u00a0more than a week\u00a0after a team of Egyptian negotiators flew to Israel in late April to hammer out\u00a0some of\u00a0the final details of a framework to provide for the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for a pause in fighting and the return of Palestinian prisoners. Talks had been ongoing for months by then,\u00a0since the last pause in the fighting fell apart in early December. With Israel agreeing for the most part to go farther than they previously had, there was a creeping sense of optimism taking hold that a deal was close at hand.\u00a0Israel appeared willing to accept fewer hostages, release more Palestinian prisoners and allow Gazans in the southern part of the enclave to return home to the north unrestricted. US officials emphasized how \u201cextraordinarily\u00a0generous on the part of Israel\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0framework was, in the words of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. After discovering the Egyptian freelancing, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani informed Israel\u2019s intelligence service Mossad that Egypt had acted alone,\u00a0two of the\u00a0sources told CNN. Al Thani and\u00a0CIA Director\u00a0Burns got to work trying to salvage the proposal and re-balance it with elements they knew Israel would require. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d\u00a0a\u00a0senior Biden administration official said of why Egyptian intelligence would try to push something through without the essential input from the others. Changes made to appeal to Hamas After the Egyptians came back from Israel and conferred with Hamas, it became clear the group wouldn\u2019t go along with what Israel was agreeing to, one of the sources said. So the Egyptian official made significant changes to get Hamas to agree. The day before Hamas made their May 6 public announcement agreeing to the proposal, an Egyptian source told CNN that Egypt had\u00a0received Hamas\u2019 response and relayed it to the Israeli side. \u201cSeveral alternatives and scenarios were proposed to overcome the main point of contention related to ending the war,\u201d said the source. The agreement\u2019s language about ending the war has been perhaps the thorniest issue throughout the negotiations. But what Hamas sent back, Netanyahu said, \u201cwas very far from Israel\u2019s core demands.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before the discussions stalled. Negotiators, including Burns, returned to Cairo for one more round of indirect talks with Hamas. Israel agreed to send a team, as did Qatar, but neither sent senior officials, an indication that despite earlier optimism a deal would not be as imminent as hoped. Two days after Hamas\u2019 response on May 6, Burns returned to Washington and sources told CNN the talks were \u201cpaused.\u201d Mediators had hoped that a pause in the fighting would delay or even prevent a serious incursion into Rafah by Israel. Military operations by Israel in Rafah are now expanding despite protest by the Biden administration that they will threaten the hundreds of thousands of civilians who had fled there for safety. If talks resume, it\u2019s expected that the Qataris would play a bigger role in the next round, the second source familiar with the negotiations said.\u00a0A re-launch of the negotiations does not appear imminent but if it were to happen Egypt would still be expected to be central given their essential proximity to Hamas, as well as Israel\u2019s preference of Egypt to Qatar. The discussions would still be expected to center\u00a0on\u00a0a broad framework that would include an initial stage in which up to 33 Israeli hostages would be released over at least 6 weeks. Hamas has been pushing to include the bodies of dead hostages in the initial release and also have the first phase flow into a second with no break. Both are positions Israel has resisted. US officials have argued that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar doesn\u2019t actually want a deal since he may think he\u2019s winning and the greater the Palestinian suffering the more the world turns on Israel. Critics of Netanyahu, including families of Israeli hostages, have accused him of being more concerned with removing Hamas from Gaza than getting his citizens home.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_nadine-menendez-trial-mortgage-consulting-job", "text": "Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s alleged co-conspirator in a yearslong extortion and bribery scheme ordered his legal counsel to set up a mortgage loan for the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s then-girlfriend and to draft a job contract for her despite her lack of experience, a witness in the federal corruption trial testified this week. Federal prosecutors have begun to lay the foundation for their\u00a0case against Menendez and his two co-defendants\u00a0in a New York courtroom. Through Tuesday, they had called\u00a0six\u00a0witnesses \u2013 an FBI special agent; a US diplomat; a former State Department employee; the lead counsel for the halal certification company owned by Wael Hana, one of Menendez\u2019s co-defendants; and\u00a0the executive assistants to Hana and\u00a0Fred Daibes, Menendez\u2019s other co-defendant.\u00a0Both executive assistants said they were subpoenaed. Some of the witnesses have testified about a halal industry scheme in which Menendez and Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, allegedly acted as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. It\u2019s one of several accusations in the sprawling case that also involves the government of Qatar, gold bars and cash seized from the senator\u2019s home, and allegations that he and his girlfriend-turned-wife took bribes in exchange for the senator\u2019s influence. Menendez and Hana \u2013 as well as the other co-defendant, New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes \u2013 have pleaded not guilty. Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, has also pleaded not guilty and is set to go on trial in July. John Moldovan, the lead counsel for Hana\u2019s certification business IS EG Halal, testified that Hana ordered him to wire Nadine Menendez a loan to pay the outstanding debt on her home, which was at risk of foreclosure. In July 2019, Hana wired Moldovan money from IS EG\u2019s account to Moldovan\u2019s personal account and ordered him to issue checks to Nadine Menendez, the lead counsel testified. Hana also asked him to write a promissory note so that Nadine Menendez would receive about $22,000 to $23,000, with a five-year term to pay back the amount in full, Moldovan testified. Moldovan said Nadine Menendez was \u201cupset and offended\u201d that Hana had a lawyer formalize the loan with a promissory note. She never signed the agreement, he testified, but she did receive the checks. Shortly after that, Moldovan testified, Hana told him he planned to give Nadine Menendez a consulting job at IS EG Halal and ordered Moldovan to prepare the job contract, which included payroll of $10,000 a month. Moldovan testified that he rarely did anything without Hana\u2019s approval. Moldovan said he drafted a contract between IS EG Halal and Strategic International Business Consultants LLC \u2013 of which Nadine Menendez was president \u2013 despite not having heard of the company. Moldovan said he never observed Nadine Menendez work or prepare any documents, nor did he hear of anyone speaking about her job performance for the company or other companies. Nadine Menendez never signed the IS EG job agreement, according to Moldovan. While he also said he didn\u2019t know if she got paid, prosecutors have pointed to three $10,000 checks. On cross-examination, the senator\u2019s attorney, Avi Weitzman, asked Moldovan if Nadine Menendez ever mentioned she was dating the senator, to which he testified she did not. The pair later married. Trial proceedings are on pause\u00a0until after Memorial\u00a0Day, when Daibes\u2019 executive assistant\u00a0is expected to\u00a0return to the witness stand.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_takeaways-from-donald-trumps-defense-in-the-hush-money-trial", "text": "The defense rested its case in Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial on Tuesday after roughly 90 minutes of testimony \u2013 and without the former president taking the stand. Trump\u2019s attorneys called two witnesses: a paralegal who entered phone records into evidence and Robert Costello, an attorney who was in talks with Michael Cohen to represent him after the FBI raided his home and office in 2018. Publicly, Trump left open the prospect that he could testify in his own defense, but his attorneys had always seemed to discount the possibility. Ultimately, the most important witness for the defense was Cohen, who testified in the prosecution\u2019s case but was subject to cross-examination that stretched across three days for more than eight hours in all. Now the jury will get a week off thanks to the Memorial Day holiday, with closing arguments set for next Tuesday. A verdict is possible by the end of next week. Here are takeaways from the final day of testimony in the Trump hush money trial: Trump doesn\u2019t take the stand Over the last several months, Trump repeatedly teased that he would take the stand in his own defense.  \u201cWell, I would if it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Trump said in an April 25 interview on Newsmax. \u201cProbably so, I would like to, I mean I think so,\u201d Trump told a Wisconsin television station on May 7. But on Tuesday, the opportunity for Trump to testify came and went quickly, with attorney Todd Blanche telling the judge once Costello was off the stand, \u201cThe defense rests.\u201d Ultimately, there was little suspense in the decision: the lawyers and the judge have been gaming out the trial\u2019s end-game schedule for the past week as though Trump would not testify. Part of the reason Trump was never expected to take the stand was the scope of the cross-examination. Prosecutors asked the judge to allow them to question the former president about a litany of his misdeeds related to other cases in order to impeach Trump\u2019s credibility as a witness. Following a routine hearing on what would be allowed \u2013 known as a Sandoval hearing \u2013 the judge ruled that prosecutors would have been allowed to question Trump about the $464 civil fraud verdict from last fall\u2019s case brought by the New York attorney general, Trump\u2019s two violations of the judge\u2019s gag order in that case, the verdicts against Trump in the two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases and the settlement Trump reached with the New York attorney general that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump foundation. In addition, Trump would have been subjected to questions related to the case, of course, including his alleged affairs with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. It all added up to the calculation from Trump and his attorneys that he was better staying off the witness stand. The most important defense was the Cohen cross-examination The cross-examination of Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s final witness, lasted eight hours \u2013 roughly four times as long as the entire defense presentation. The difference underscored the importance of Cohen \u2013 both for the prosecution\u2019s case against Trump as well as how the defense\u2019s efforts to discredit Trump\u2019s former fixer as a witness could be key to an acquittal or hung jury. Blanche tried to undercut Cohen\u2019s credibility, accusing him of making up his conversations with Trump, stealing from his former boss and continuing to lie even after pleading guilty to perjury in 2018. The most dramatic moment in the cross-examination came when Blanche confronted Cohen about an October 24, 2016, call he had with Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, at 8:02 p.m., in which Cohen testified that Schiller put Trump on the phone and Cohen told him he was going ahead with the payment to Daniels. But Blanche showed Cohen text messages he exchanged with Schiller before and after that call, showing he was dealing with a teenager prank calling him and asking Schiller for help. \u201cThat was a lie,\u201d Blanche alleged of Cohen\u2019s testimony he spoke to Trump about moving forward with the hush money deal. \u201cYou were actually talking to Mr. Schiller about the fact that you were getting harassing phone calls from a 14-year-old; correct? \u201cPart of it was the 14-year-old, but I know that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time and there was more than potentially just this. That\u2019s what I recall based upon the documents that I reviewed,\u201d Cohen responded. Prosecutors tried to rehabilitate Cohen\u2019s testimony, introducing a screengrab from C-SPAN showing Trump leaving a Florida rally stage with Schiller five minutes before the call. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger also tried to remind jurors that it was Trump \u2013 not Cohen \u2013 who was on trial in this case. \u201cNow, I know it may feel like you are on trial here after cross-examination. Are you actually on trial here?\u201d Hoffinger asked Cohen.  \u201cNo ma\u2019am,\u201d Cohen said. After prosecutors rested, Blanche made a motion for Judge Juan Merchan to dismiss the case \u2013 a typical motion filed by defendants that rarely succeeds. Blanche argued that Cohen had lied in his testimony in this case and it should be tossed out. \u201cSo, you want me to take it out of the jury\u2019s hands and decide before it even gets to the jury that, as a matter of law, this person is so not worthy of belief that it shouldn\u2019t be considered by the jury? That\u2019s what you\u2019re asking?\u201d Merchan asked. \u201cThat his entire testimony should not be considered by the jury. Absolutely. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re asking the court to do,\u201d Blanche responded. Merchan was skeptical, later asking Blanche: \u201cYou said his lies are \u2018irrefutable,\u2019 but you think he\u2019s going to fool 12 New Yorkers into believing this lie?\u201d Costello had a bumpy ride Arguing against prosecutors\u2019 efforts to block Costello from testifying, Trump\u2019s attorneys said that Costello would rebut prosecutors\u2019 suggestion that Trump put on a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d to intimidate Cohen to keep quiet in 2018. Merchan ruled Costello could testify but said he wouldn\u2019t allow the testimony to become a mini-trial about whether there was in fact a pressure campaign on Cohen and how it affected Trump\u2019s former fixer at the time. Trump attorney Emil Bove sought to show Cohen used Costello\u2019s legal services \u2013 and as a backchannel to Trump \u2013 though he never signed a retainer agreement and ultimately went with another lawyer to handle his federal case. In their first meeting, Costello said Cohen was \u201cabsolutely manic\u201d and suicidal after the FBI raid on his properties. According to Costello, Cohen said 10-12 times during the meeting, \u201cI swear to God, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump.\u201d Costello\u2019s testimony in front of the jury Monday quickly devolved into tension between Costello and the judge. Merchan cleared the courtroom to scold Costello for eye rolls and mutterings about the judge\u2019s rulings that limited what he could say on the stand. On cross-examination, Hoffinger sought to discredit Costello, suggesting he was more aligned with Trump\u2019s interests than Cohen when he was advising him in the spring of 2018. Hoffinger suggested Costello, who was in frequent contact with his close friend Rudy Giuliani, was a part of the pressure campaign to keep Cohen in line. Costello acknowledged he offered Cohen a backchannel to Trump through Giuliani but said that was for Cohen\u2019s benefit. Closing arguments set for Tuesday Both sides are back in court Tuesday afternoon \u2013 without jurors present \u2013 in order to discuss the instructions that the judge will give to the jury before deliberations next week. Then the court will be dark for a week, a scheduling decision Merchan chose so the final stages of the trial weren\u2019t broken up by a four-day Memorial Day weekend. Merchan told jurors they will return next Tuesday for closing arguments, which are expected to take the whole day. Once the jury gets its instructions, Trump\u2019s fate will be in its hands.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/takeaways-from-donald-trumps-defense-in-the-hush-money-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The new alert from the EPA outlines basic cybersecurity measures that US water facilities need to take to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act, a federal law the agency uses to regulate water plants\u2019 safety and security practices. The EPA can fine facilities that are deemed noncompliant or, in more serious cases, can pursue criminal charges. More than 70% of water systems the EPA has inspected since September violate \u201cbasic\u201d requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act, according to the agency. A spate of cybercriminal and state-backed hacks against US water facilities in the last six months has alarmed senior US officials because of the ease with which the hackers accessed sensitive equipment at the facilities. A Russian-speaking hacking group\u00a0claimed credit\u00a0for a cyberattack in January that caused a tank at a Texas water facility to overflow. \u201cAs EPA steps up inspections [of facilities], the Agency intends to use enforcement authorities to address problems quickly that it observes in the field such as failure to prepare adequate\u201d emergency response plans, the EPA\u00a0alert\u00a0says.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_us-gaza-pier-aid-not-delivered", "text": "None of the aid that has been unloaded from the temporary pier the US constructed off the coast of Gaza has been delivered to the broader Palestinian population,\u00a0as the US\u00a0works with the UN and Israel to identify\u00a0safe\u00a0delivery routes inside the enclave, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. Several desperate Gazans intercepted trucks delivering aid from the pier over the weekend, leading the UN to suspend the delivery operations until the logistical challenges are resolved. The US\u00a0is\u00a0working\u00a0with Israel and the United Nations to establish \u201calternative routes\u201d for the safe delivery of the 569 tons of aid transported to Gaza since last week, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Tuesday. Asked\u00a0whether\u00a0any of the\u00a0aid has been delivered to the people of Gaza, Ryder said, \u201cAs of today, I do not believe so.\u201d\u00a0He added that aid had been held in an assembly area on shore, but as of Tuesday had begun getting moved to warehouses for distribution throughout Gaza as alternative routes have been established. A US official told CNN that the Defense Department and UN are still working to determine\u00a0how much aid can be held at he staging area inside Gaza at any given time. The amount of aid getting to the Gaza shoreline from its initial staging area in Cyprus has also fallen short of initial Pentagon estimates. Since Friday, more than\u00a0569 metric tons of humanitarian assistance have been delivered through the temporary pier, called JLOTS,\u00a0or Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, to the shore of Gaza to be distributed by humanitarian partners, Ryder said. But\u00a0Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper, the commander of the US Naval Forces Central Command, said last week that the US hoped to initially transport 500 tons of aid per day via the pier, and scale up as time went on. Over the weekend, as trucks began moving the aid delivered off the floating pier,\u00a0CNN reported that a group of\u00a0men in Gaza intercepted the aid,\u00a0saying\u00a0they did not trust that\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0actually meant\u00a0for the Palestinian people. \u201cI have doubts,\u201d Mounir Ayad, a\u00a0Gaza resident, told CNN near the\u00a0pier. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this floating pier or what it indicates and what its purpose is. They say it\u2019s for\u00a0aid, but people are apprehensive. Is this\u00a0aid\u00a0or something else? We know that the US has never supported the Palestinian cause, so it\u2019s implausible that it\u2019s giving us\u00a0aid\u00a0without something in return.\u201d Ryder acknowledged on Tuesday that some initial aid brought into Gaza was \u201cintercepted by some people who took that aid off those vehicles.\u201d \u201cFully appreciating the desperation, but also fully appreciating the fact that it is very important that this aid get to the people who need it most, that\u2019s going to continue to be the focus. So I understand, you know, the focus on why is this not working, or why is that not working, but what we\u2019re focused on is how we can work to ensure that the Palestinian people get the aid.\u201d The Pentagon\u00a0said in April\u00a0that the goal was to deliver roughly 500 tons of aid \u2014\u00a0amounting to 90 truckloads \u2014\u00a0per day to the starving population of Gaza, with the intent of working up to 150 trucks daily. The pier was finally\u00a0anchored to Gaza\u00a0last week as the humanitarian situation in the\u00a0enclave\u00a0has only worsened. Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of\u00a0the US Agency for International Development\u2019s\u00a0Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said last week that conditions in Gaza \u201chave not improved and in the past two weeks we have seen a vital border crossing close, and at a time when it is critical we see more aid move. Across Gaza, 2.2 million people,\u00a0the entire population, is facing acute food insecurity.\u201d The US has faced\u00a0a number of challenges\u00a0with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah which could raise security concerns; early issues with establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza, as the US has repeatedly said no US troops would have boots on the ground; and logistical challenges like sea and weather conditions that could continue to limit the ability to use it. Ryder said Tuesday that the US is continuing to push for aid to get in other ways, including through land routes. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is continuing to have conversations with his Israeli counterpart regarding the effort to get aid through land crossings, including through Rafah, he said. When White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Israeli officials as part of his trip to the Middle East over the weekend, the Israelis presented their latest thinking about a potential Rafah incursion during which the US side asked a lot of \u201chard questions,\u201d according to a senior administration official. This person noted that the two sides will continue those discussions but that the Israelis have been incorporating US feedback and concerns as they continue to work through those plans. The official added that both sides share the joint goal of destroying Hamas. As part of the discussions with the Israelis, US officials also made a series of \u201cspecific requests\u201d with regard to humanitarian aid, which they have agreed to implement, according to the official. \u201cI thought the the conversations were, were quite constructive and now we\u2019re looking to see some of what was agreed unfold here over the coming days,\u201d the official said. Just Tuesday, according to this person, over 370 pallets of aid were distributed in Gaza. The US has also made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force. It\u2019s unclear with what regularity those will continue; Ryder said Tuesday it is an \u201coption we have available to us\u201d but he declined to say\u00a0whether\u00a0that effort would continue \u201cwell into the future.\u201d The last humanitarian air drop announced by US Central Command was conducted on May 9. \u201cThis is not a sole US military effort, it\u2019s an interagency effort. It\u2019s an international effort. And we understand the desperate need of the Palestinian people right now,\u201d Ryder said of efforts to get aid into Gaza.\u00a0 \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to continue to work to get them what they need.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_trump-cohen-costello-drama-analysis", "text": "Twelve New Yorkers are on deck. As Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial races toward its climax, his attorneys are previewing how they will beseech a jury next week to spare their client the shame of being the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. On a wild day in court Monday, Judge Juan Merchan accused one disrespectful defense witness of trying to stare him down, while the ex-president\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen, sensationally admitted to stealing thousands of dollars from his old boss\u2019 firm. But beneath the uproar, there is also a clear sense that this trial \u2013 which is intertwined with the country\u2019s future, given Trump\u2019s bid to reclaim the White House \u2013 is now in its fateful endgame. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s lawyers made a long-shot bid for the dismissal of his first criminal trial before the jury has even been asked to deliberate. The gambit is a familiar one for defense teams that rarely works, but it offered a glimpse into the narrative Trump\u2019s lawyers will place before the jury, likely next Tuesday, after the Memorial Day holiday. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Todd Blanche, argued prosecutors had failed to prove their case that Trump intended to mislead voters in 2016 by falsifying financial records to disguise a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. And he implored Merchan not to hand jurors a case so reliant on testimony from Cohen, a confessed liar. With the jury out of the room, Merchan took several stabs at getting it straight. He said: \u201cYou want me to take it out of the jury\u2019s hands and decide before it even gets to the jury, that as a matter of law, this person is so not worthy of belief that it shouldn\u2019t be considered by the jury?\u201d Blanche replied: \u201cWe didn\u2019t just catch him in a lie, your honor, he came in here with a history of lying.\u201d The judge hardly seemed impressed. \u201cYou said his lies are \u2018irrefutable\u2019; that you think he\u2019s going to fool 12 New Yorkers into believing this lie?\u201d Merchan said. Blanche answered: \u201cI certainly hope he doesn\u2019t convince 12 jurors.\u201d The judge said he\u2019d consider the request, but it would be a major surprise if anything now happens to prevent the jury from getting the case. Trump cranks up his strategy to discredit the trial before a verdict Trump, meanwhile, escalated his inside-outside courtroom strategy that has turned his four criminal indictments into a rationale for his bid to win back the White House. He lashed out at Merchan in the corridor while surrounded by another posse of Republican Party supplicants. \u201cThis case should be dropped by the judge. I think the judge, if he did that, would gain the respect back,\u201d Trump said, insisting \u201cthere was no crime\u201d and again complaining about a courtroom he called a \u201cfreezing cold ice box.\u201d Trump has denied the affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case, as he has in all others against him. The prosecution rested its case Monday, after trying to rehabilitate the sometimes rocky testimony of Cohen, the self-described former Trump \u201cthug\u201d who once wrote that he knew where the ex-president\u2019s skeletons were buried because he did the burying. Barring an 11th hour change of heart, it appears that the former president himself won\u2019t testify in his own defense \u2014 in what would be a sound legal decision as he\u2019d almost certain make the case all about himself again after his lawyers spent days trying to make it about Cohen\u2019s questionable credibility. Key developments Monday\u2019s court action at times threatened to spin out of control \u2014 in a way that only a Trump trial can. But several key developments underscored the way the case is headed inexorably toward a jury deliberation that will keep the country on edge. The prosecution\u2019s main task was to try to repair damage to Cohen\u2019s credibility and to stress to the jury \u2014 and to the judge in the back-and-forth over the motion to dismiss \u2014 that the case was about far more than Trump\u2019s former fixer. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued that the foundation of evidence presented in court before Cohen\u2019s testimony corroborated what he had to say. Colangelo said that \u201cat minimum, a reasonable juror could conclude the invoices, the ledger entries, the signed checks with check stubs \u2014 all contain false information.\u201d And he argued there was an \u201coverwhelming record of concealment\u201d that supports an intent to defraud on Trump\u2019s part. Until Cohen entered a bruising cross-examination last week, the case appeared to be going well for the prosecution. But the witness who was always a big risk turned into a potentially case-derailing disaster. He was confronted with evidence that called into question his testimony under oath about speaking with Trump on October 24, 2016, to tell him the hush money payment scheme was going according to plan. The defense presented Cohen with text messages he had sent to Trump\u2019s bodyguard Keith Schiller, who was with Trump at the time,\u00a0just before the call, suggesting the conversation was about an entirely different matter. The implication was that Cohen didn\u2019t speak to Trump about the hush money payment, raising questions about his fixer\u2019s truthfulness. The defense is implying that if Cohen cannot be trusted on this detail, his entire testimony implicating Trump cannot be believed. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger on Monday tried to clean up some of Cohen\u2019s mess. \u201cI know it may feel like you\u2019re on trial here after cross-examination, but are you actually on trial?\u201d she asked Cohen. \u201cNo ma\u2019am,\u201d said the man who once said he idolized Trump. But Cohen may have further damaged his standing with jurors earlier in the day when he admitted that he stole $60,000 from the Trump Organization. His admission, about a cut he took from a payment to a tech company and a subsequent reimbursement with interest from his boss\u2019 firm, caused Blanche to ask: \u201cDid you ever have to plead guilty to larceny?\u201d which drew a smirk from Trump. Some legal commentators suggested this episode was another bombshell shattering  Cohen\u2019s credibility. But others argued that it was just another data point for jurors who would have few illusions about Cohen\u2019s character after he admitted to repeatedly lying on his own and Trump\u2019s account. \u201cWhat is portrayed in the media is not what the jurors are ever going to see if they are following the judge\u2019s instructions not to look at any stories on TV or read anything about this. It\u2019s another piece of information for them to consider,\u201d retired judge LaDoris Hazzard Cordell told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Courtroom chaos Veteran lawyers and court reporters said they\u2019d never seen anything like the scene precipitated by defense witness Robert Costello. The lawyer who had advised Cohen was called to the stand to testify for the defense, but it didn\u2019t take long for him to get on the wrong side of Merchan. When the judge sustained an objection to a defense question, Costello let out an audible \u201cjeez,\u201d prompting the judge to lean forward and say, \u201cSorry?\u201d Costello\u2019s disdain was evident again when the same thing happened shortly afterward and the judge asked the jury to leave the courtroom. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a side eye and you don\u2019t roll your eyes,\u201d the judge warned. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a witness on the stand, if you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019 you don\u2019t say strike it,\u201d Merchan said. Costello replied with a glare. \u201cAre you staring me down?\u201d Merchan asked before clearing the courtroom. Costello\u2019s behavior was a stunning show of disrespect for a judge in his own courtroom \u2014 and the first part of it was visible to jurors. \u201cI don\u2019t think this witness really helped this defense at all,\u201d Cordell told Tapper. \u201cMy guess, maybe they called this witness because their client wanted them to do that. He really didn\u2019t add anything and really created more of a problem than a help,\u201d she said. Predictably, the ultimate chaos agent enjoyed the disruption. Trump told reporters after court wrapped for the day: \u201cYou saw what happened to a highly respected lawyer today, Bob Costello. Wow. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d Former long-time trial attorney Terri Austin agreed. \u201cIn all my years of practice, over 30 plus, I\u2019ve never seen a moment like this,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. It\u2019s a superlative worn out by repetition ever since Trump descended the golden escalator in 2015 at his eponymous skyscraper not far from the Manhattan courtroom. And whatever happens in the coming days, we\u2019ll likely hear it again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-cohen-costello-drama-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump finally had a good day in court. The presumptive GOP nominee has often seemed embarrassed and infuriated by his first criminal trial, which has featured salacious expos\u00e9s of his personal life and details of his alleged attempts to cover it up. But on Thursday, he got to savor his former fixer-turned-enemy Michael Cohen wobbling on the stand under a fearsome cross-examination. Cohen appeared to be tripped up over an account of a call he\u2019d previously said under oath was to discuss Trump\u2019s hush money payment to adult film Star Stormy Daniels. It emerged under questioning on Thursday that, at least to begin with, the topic of the call was about another matter entirely. It was the kind of inconsistency that Trump\u2019s attorneys can use to try to sow reasonable doubt about Cohen\u2019s truthfulness and credibility in the mind of a single juror. That\u2019s all it would take for Trump to walk. And now, the prosecution faces a stiff challenge in repairing the damage when they get to their redirect examination of Cohen\u2019s testimony following the close of cross-examination next week. \u201cI think what happened today still is so devastating they have to do something,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cIf the case ended today and there were final statements, I think there would not be a conviction.\u201d Trump left court after a day in which he was supported by another posse of GOP lawmakers, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, well satisfied. \u201cI think it was a very interesting day, it was a fascinating day. And it shows what a scam this whole thing is,\u201d the former president said. His hyperbolic spin and unique take on proceedings rang less hollow than usual given several positive moments for the defense in what has largely been a grim month for Trump in the courtroom. Another day of testimony from Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s critical witness, came as the case hurtled toward its climax with the judge telling lawyers to be ready to deliver summations as early as Tuesday. That means it\u2019s feasible the jury will retire to consider its verdict in the first criminal trial of a former president sometime after Memorial Day and just five months before Trump hopes to reclaim the White House. A pivotal moment On Tuesday, when the court was last in session this week, Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche had what most legal experts viewed as a rough day as he embarked on the cross-examination of Cohen. But he bounced back in a big way Thursday. Blanche first spent time seeking to destroy Cohen\u2019s credibility. He highlighted the former Trump fixer\u2019s proven history of lying for his former boss and on his own behalf. And using text messages and social media posts, he established that Cohen resented Trump and wanted to see him convicted in a case in which the ex-president is accused of falsifying financial records to hide the payoff in 2016 in an early example of election interference. (He has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Daniels.) Then, in one of the most dramatic moments in the entire trial, Blanche drilled down on a call that Cohen placed to his boss\u2019 bodyguard, Keith Schiller, who was with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen had testified earlier this week that the purpose of the call was to discuss with Trump \u201cthe Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.\u201d But Blanche produced a text from Cohen to Schiller before the call in which the lawyer said he wanted to get help in dealing with a 14-year-old who was prank calling him. He didn\u2019t mention Daniels in the text ahead of the conversation, which only lasted 96 seconds. \u201cThat was a lie!\u201d Blanche said, raising his voice. \u201cYou did not talk to President Trump on that night, you talked to Keith Schiller. \u2026 You can admit it.\u201d Blanche argued that it was impossible that Cohen would have had sufficient time to discuss the prank calls and then go on to update Trump about the complicated situation with Daniels. Cohen insisted, \u201cI believe I also spoke to President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it\u2019s going to be resolved.\u201d Blanche then wielded a rhetorical dagger, telling Cohen: \u201cWe are not asking for your belief \u2013 this jury doesn\u2019t want to hear what you think happened.\u201d Judge Juan Merchan sustained an immediate objection from the prosecution to the comment, but Trump\u2019s lawyer had emphatically made his point. The exchange was so significant because \u2013 notwithstanding days of testimony and evidence put on by the prosecution to corroborate claims that Trump broke the law \u2013 the case still largely depends on Cohen, himself a convicted felon who has a proven record of lying. Since the burden to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt lies with the prosecution, the exchange could raise the chances of at least one juror questioning Cohen\u2019s version of events. And it also raises the possibility that some jurors might believe that they have been lied to by Cohen earlier in the trial. If such a feeling takes hold among jurors, who have put their lives on hold to hear the case, it could be disastrous to the prosecution. \u2018A blow on the chin\u2019 No one can say how individual members of the jury will sift the evidence and competing testimony. But experienced trial lawyers immediately spotted a potential turning point. \u201cI think it has to have raised some doubt,\u201d criminal defense attorney Nikki Lotze said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d of Blanche\u2019s clash with Cohen. \u201cThere was testimony previously that this phone call was about X and now there are texts that suggest it is about Y \u2026 and not a lot of time for there to be a conversation about both X and Y.\u201c Jim Trusty, a former Trump attorney, also believed the exchange was significant and was cause for the ex-president to feel upbeat. \u201cThe defense set the whole trial up to be a referendum on Cohen\u2019s honesty. That is exactly where you want this fight to be, so it is a good moment,\u201d he said. When Blanche eventually wraps up his cross-examination of Cohen, the prosecution will get a chance to try to repair any damage from one of the trial\u2019s most significant moments so far. Some experts pointed out that it was only one small blip compared to a mountain of evidence, much of which looks potentially problematic for Trump. Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst, said that Blanche\u2019s apparent trip-up of Cohen was good professional lawyering by the defense, but he disputed the idea that the episode was devastating to the prosecution case. \u201cIt was a blow on the chin. My experience of 30 years of doing this is it takes more than one punch to knock out a witness,\u201d Eisen told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Conservative lawyer and sworn Trump critic George Conway, who was also in court Thursday, told CNN that while there were some good moments for Blanche, much of his cross-examination was \u201cscattered\u201d and meandering and did not establish a strong narrative. But another less theatrical moment in Thursday\u2019s testimony may also offer the defense a strong opening in their final summation to the jury. Blanche asked Cohen about a time when he said he lied under oath to a judge in a different case because \u201cthe stakes affected you personally.\u201d Cohen agreed he had. Then Blanche asked Cohen: \u201cDoes the outcome of this trial affect you personally?\u201d Cohen answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The unspoken implication here is that if Cohen lied in a previous trial that affected him personally, why would he not do the same in a trial involving his now sworn foe, the former president? Again, the defense doesn\u2019t have to prove Cohen is lying. It just has to make one juror think it\u2019s possible \u2014 and therefore make impossible the unanimous verdict needed for conviction. Many prosecutions use potentially problematic witnesses with histories of lying and demonstrated antipathy toward the accused all the time \u2014 for instance, in organized crime cases where lower-ranking associates are used to incriminate kingpins despite their own legal vulnerabilities. So Cohen\u2019s struggles at a key moment on Thursday don\u2019t necessarily mean this case is in deep trouble. But everyone connected with the trial knew before it began that Cohen\u2019s pivotal role in this case represented a risk for the prosecution. The huge scale of that gamble was laid bare in court on Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-best-day-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden", "text": "Joe Biden sounded more like a professional wrestler than a president when he issued a vertical video social media debate challenge to his rival Wednesday morning. \u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020!\u201d Biden said at the outset of the 14-second video, during which he also found time to: \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Trump said, accepting the challenge on his social media platform with a nod to words that typically open boxing matches. The debates are set for June 27 on CNN and September 10 on ABC News. While Biden proposed two meetings and a vice presidential in late July, Trump\u2019s campaign suggested debates in July and August \u2013 the months when the Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are taking place \u2013 as well. \u201dI think we should go two hours,\u201d Trump said during an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, an attempt to criticize Biden\u2019s endurance. Trump added that the debaters should be required to stand at a podium rather than sit. \u201cI think a debate should be standing up,\u201d he said. Both men, well into their Social Security and Medicare years, would like to appear as forceful as possible. CNN invited the presumptive nominees to debate on the network on June 27 at CNN\u2019s studio in Atlanta. It\u2019ll be on cable, so not exactly pay-per-view, but certainly not the aired-everywhere style that has become typical of presidential debate since the Commission on Presidential Debates started sponsoring them in 1988. Those commission-sponsored debates were broadcast on every network with the same sets reused every four years and conducted usually at colleges and universities with live audiences. A town hall version allowed select voters to ask questions of both candidates. The commission said its debates are planned and it will carry forward with planning. The CNN debate, on the other hand, will be conducted in a TV studio with no audience, which means no applause or cheering. While the specific format for the ABC News debate has not been announced, a debate at ABC News studios in New York would harken back to the first televised presidential debates in 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated four times. While he has accepted both invitations, Trump was already criticizing the idea of an in-studio debate. In a social media post that included an insult for Biden, Trump said he preferred, \u201cfor excitement purposes, a very large venue, although\u00a0Biden\u00a0is supposedly afraid of crowds.\u201d Still, Biden\u2019s challenge and Trump\u2019s response were not entirely spontaneous. From CNN\u2019s report: Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates have taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.\u00a0The Washington Post was first\u00a0to report on those conversations. June is already shaping up to be an exceptionally busy month in US politics. The Supreme Court could rule then on whether Trump should enjoy any sort of absolute immunity from prosecution. Biden\u2019s son Hunter faces two separate criminal trials, one for tax evasion in Los Angeles and the other for a rarely prosecuted gun charge in Delaware. CNN\u2019s debate that month will come before either party conducts its nominating convention, presumably before Trump picks a running mate, and much earlier than the commission\u2019s planned debates, the first of which had been scheduled for September. After grumbling from both campaigns, the Commission on Presidential Debates issued a statement arguing that beginning in September would still allow for early voters to watch before making a decision. The campaigns clearly disagreed; Trump and Biden have both argued that earlier debates are warranted since many Americans are likely to vote early in the months before Election Day on November 5. Biden, for his part, may be looking for a quicker opportunity to reset the narrative of the campaign, in which his arguments about the strength of the economy or the threat Trump poses to democracy have not yet helped him gain traction in battleground states. Trump, meanwhile, could benefit from turning the conversation away from his criminal trials and work to harden perceptions of Biden as soon as possible. One person who has already indicated he is not thrilled with the debate plans: independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In order to qualify for CNN\u2019s debate, a candidate must be polling at or above 15% in four national polls of registered or likely voters between March 13 and June 20 and be on the ballot in enough states to conceivably win 270 electoral votes, according to a news release from CNN. ABC News outlined similar criteria. For now, that would exclude Kennedy. In a post on X, he accused the campaigns of \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the stage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The video details \u201cwhat happens after Donald Trump wins\u201d with a narrator reading hypothetical headlines like \u201cEconomy Booms!\u201d and \u201cBorder is closed,\u201d styled as World War I-era newspaper clippings. Under one headline that reads \u201cWhat\u2019s next for America?\u201d is a reference to the \u201ccreation of a unified Reich.\u201d Another headline in the video states \u201c15 Million Illegal Aliens Deported\u201d next to the start and end days of World War I. The term \u201creich\u201d is often associated Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, who designated Germany a \u201cThird Reich\u201d from 1933 to 1945. The video was removed from Trump\u2019s Truth Social account Tuesday morning. Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, said in a statement that the video was not created by the campaign and was \u201creposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word, while the President was in court.\u201d President Joe Biden and his allies, meanwhile, swiftly and emphatically condemned Trump over the video, with both his campaign and the White House denouncing what it said was flagrant antisemitism. \u201cThis is the same guy that uses Hitler\u2019s language, not America\u2019s,\u201d Biden\u00a0told donors\u00a0in Boston\u00a0on Tuesday, according to reporters traveling with the president. \u201cTrump says if he loses again in November there be a blood bath,\u201d he added later. \u201cIt is abhorrent, sickening, and disgraceful for anyone to promote content associated with Germany\u2019s Nazi government under Adolf Hitler,\u201d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates added in a statement. Trump is \u201cnot playing games; he is telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power: rule as a dictator over a \u2018unified reich,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said.

At a rally in December, Trump pushed\u00a0back\u00a0on criticism that his rhetoric has echoed Hitler, telling a crowd in Iowa that he\u2019s never read \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

When pressed on whether his answer suggested he supported some restrictions on contraceptives, Trump said, \u201cThings really do have a lot to do with the states and some states are going to have different policies than others. But I\u2019m coming out within a week or so with a very comprehensive policy.\u201d The Biden campaign quickly jumped on Trump\u2019s comments, posting clips of the interview on social media and releasing a statement saying Trump \u201cwants to rip away our freedom to access birth control.\u201d \u201cWomen across the country are already suffering from Donald Trump\u2019s post-Roe\u00a0nightmare, and if he wins a second term, it\u2019s clear he wants to go even further by restricting access to birth control and emergency contraceptives. It\u2019s not enough for Trump that women\u2019s lives are being put at risk, doctors are being threatened with jail time, and extreme bans are being enacted with no exceptions for rape or incest. He wants to rip away our freedom to access birth control too,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. \u201cWhile Trump works overtime to roll back the clock and rip away women\u2019s freedoms, President Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting nonstop to protect access to birth control and women\u2019s right to make their own personal health care decisions,\u201d she continued. Legal access to birth control is popular among most Americans. Ninety percent of women ages 18 to 64 have used contraception at some point in their reproductive years, and\u00a0about three-quarters\u00a0have used more than one contraceptive method throughout their lifetime, according to a study by KFF, a nonprofit health polling, research and journalism organization. A FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos poll\u00a0conducted in 2022\u00a0found 89% of Americans support mostly or completely legal access to birth control pills and 71% support access to emergency contraception like Plan B. Reproductive rights have been a dominating election issue since the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in the summer of 2022. Trump frequently touts his role in the elimination of federal abortion protections, which followed his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who voted\u00a0with the conservative majority in the decision to overturn Roe. But he has said that Republicans \u201cstill have to win elections\u201d and has pointed out that many GOP candidates who took hard-line stances on abortion post-Roe went on to lose their elections.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/trump-birth-control-comments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story this week. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this week, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Blinken\u2019s comments were an early indication of the Biden administration\u2019s openness to taking action against the Netherlands-based court for its application for arrest warrants for the senior Israeli officials. The court\u2019s chief prosecutor Karim Khan also issued warrants for senior Hamas officials, including its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has faced questions about its condemnation of the ICC\u2019s actions while saying it continues to support the court\u2019s investigation into Russian war crimes during its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cRegarding the question of whether or not we\u2019ll continue to provide support to the ICC with respect to crimes that are committed in Ukraine, yes, we continue that work,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at a news conference after a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Monday. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a news conference on Monday that the ICC has done \u201cimportant work over the years to hold people accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d that the US still supports. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the time to look at it, to digest it and perhaps issue a more complete response,\u201d Miller said about the ICC applications.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_fani-willis-scott-mcafee-georgia-elections", "text": "Two key figures in former President Donald Trump\u2019s election interference trial in Georgia will\u00a0fend off challengers in their elections Tuesday, CNN projects. Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney who is prosecuting Trump, is projected to win her Democratic primary rematch with attorney and author Christian Wise Smith. And Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the former president\u2019s case, is projected to win his nonpartisan election for Fulton County Superior Court. The 2020 election interference case in Georgia was sidetracked for months over whether Willis should be disqualified\u00a0following revelations that she\u00a0had a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade.\u00a0Willis has managed to stay\u00a0on, while\u00a0Wade\u00a0stepped down in March. An appeals court has said it will revisit the question of whether Willis should have been removed from the case. That has left the Trump case\u00a0effectively at a standstill.\u00a0A legal argument before the Supreme Court over whether\u00a0the former president\u00a0has immunity from prosecution also remains an issue in the Georgia case and may not be decided until this summer. Wise Smith, Willis\u2019 primary opponent, finished third in the 2020 Democratic primary for Fulton County district attorney. In this year\u2019s campaign, he questioned the resources that Willis\u2019 office was devoting to Trump\u2019s prosecution. Wise Smith said in a March interview with CNN\u2019s Laura Coates that it was \u201cvery unfortunate that her personal life has become so public. And you know, I feel for her in that sense.\u201d Willis will next face Republican attorney\u00a0Courtney Kramer,\u00a0who worked in\u00a0the\u00a0White House counsel\u2019s office under Trump.\u00a0Kramer, who was unopposed in the Republican primary, will be the heavy underdog against Willis in\u00a0deep-blue Fulton County, which is home to most of Atlanta.\u00a0Trump won 26% of the vote in the county in 2020, compared with Joe Biden\u2019s 73%. McAfee, meanwhile, faced criminal defense lawyer and talk radio host Robert Patillo in his nonpartisan general election Tuesday. Patillo, who describes himself as a \u201cconservative Democrat,\u201d\u00a0had criticized McAfee\u2019s handling of the decision not to remove Willis from the prosecution when details of her romantic relationship with Wade emerged. Another contender,\u00a0Tiffani Johnson, had filed to take on McAfee but was disqualified after she did not appear at a hearing challenging her eligibility. Tuesday\u2019s election was the first for McAfee, who was appointed to his job by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in December 2022 to fill a retirement vacancy. Campaigning in Atlanta on Tuesday, McAfee told CNN he had \u201creally enjoyed kind of being out there on the trail.\u201d \u201cUsually, we are in this legal bubble, where you are just talking to lawyers, and it is a healthy thing to get out there talking to some other folks,\u201d he said. McAfee also spoke of wanting to further voters\u2019 trust in institutions. \u201cIn my little corner of the world, if I can do everything I can to instill that trust, to further that trust, that is what I try to do,\u201d the judge said. McAfee had a major fundraising advantage in his race, in part due to bipartisan support from influential figures.\u00a0Kemp and former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, were the marquee guests at a recent fundraising event for McAfee. Kemp could wind up being a witness in the Trump case. And Barnes was already a witness in the Willis disqualification issue. CNN\u2019s Ryan Young and Devon M.

{"id": "2024_05_21_politics_bob-menendez-trump-circus-trial", "text": "Andrew Giuliani broke away from the press scrum across the street from former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0and, holding his phone aloft as he livestreamed the latest from Lower Manhattan,\u00a0promised\u00a0his\u00a0audience \u201cmore coverage here shortly.\u201d Asked about the other trial of note in the area \u2013 around the corner, less than 500 feet away \u2013\u00a0the son of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani\u00a0squinted into the middle distance\u00a0from Manhattan Criminal Court, where the defense had just rested its case. After a brief, confused\u00a0silence, he smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right, of course,\u201d\u00a0the onetime candidate for New York governor said.\u00a0\u201cForgot about that.\u201d He\u2019s not the only one. Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial, which began eight days ago in the nearby US District Court, has been an afterthought to just about everyone \u2013 Republican, Democrat, hot dog vendor \u2013 in this maze of government buildings, bodegas, tiny green parks and chain coffee shops. The New Jersey Democrat has been charged by federal prosecutors with accepting\u00a0bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars\u00a0\u2013\u00a0some of the payments\u00a0allegedly\u00a0delivered in the form of gold bars\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in exchange for assorted favors for a trio of\u00a0local businessmen and two foreign governments and\u00a0then\u00a0conspiring to cover it up\u00a0after being indicted. The 70-year-old has insisted on his innocence, as have his two co-defendants, who have also pleaded not guilty. In a different place and time, the trial of a sitting\u00a0member of the US Senate\u00a0\u2013 who until recently chaired the chamber\u2019s powerful Foreign Relations Committee \u2013 would dominate\u00a0the local tabloids, be the center of a national partisan melee and appear,\u00a0at\u00a0least occasionally,\u00a0on the itinerary of Republicans gathering daily about a tenth of a mile away. But this is 2024, a presidential election year, and\u00a0 Trump \u2013 with former fixer Michael Cohen and porn star Stormy Daniels captivating in supporting roles \u2013 often feels like the only show in town. So it goes for Menendez,\u00a0who is likely pleased to have his legal drama playing out in relative obscurity. It\u2019s a similar dynamic for his Democratic colleagues as they navigate the final months of his term and, as most\u00a0political\u00a0observers expect, their 51-49 Senate majority. On Tuesday, as a witness for the prosecution in the\u00a0senator\u2019s\u00a0case testified about his role in delivering what he called a loan of more than $20,000, with no interest attached, to Menendez\u2019s\u00a0now-wife from one of the co-defendants, a laundry list of Republican lawmakers and Trump pals, led by Donald Trump Jr., held court with\u00a0reporters\u00a0around the corner. Their message echoed that of the rotating cast of\u00a0loyalists\u00a0who have argued during breaks in Trump\u2019s trial that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, at the direction of vengeful Democratic partisans, is using \u201clawfare\u201d reminiscent of\u00a0what\u00a0Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson\u00a0called\u00a0\u201cevery little tin-pot dictatorship across the world\u201d against the\u00a0once\u00a0and future GOP presidential nominee. \u201cWhen (Trump-friendly witness) Bob Costello was trying to answer on cross-examination today, the prosecutors were cutting him off. They didn\u2019t want him to tell the full truth,\u201d former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said\u00a0Tuesday, her voice nearly drowned out by chanting from Trump supporters gathered in an adjacent park. Shortly afterward, similar remarks by\u00a0Missouri Sen. Eric\u00a0Schmitt were cut off by a passerby,\u00a0who stopped to vigorously declare Donald Trump Jr. \u201ca phony\u00a0m*therf**ker.\u201d Others taking\u00a0their\u00a0turns included the former president\u2019s son, former\u00a0acting US\u00a0Attorney General Matt Whitaker, former\u00a0Trump adviser\u00a0Sebastian Gorka, Texas\u00a0Lt. Gov.\u00a0Dan Patrick, Jackson, and Reps.\u00a0Mar\u00eda\u00a0Elvira\u00a0Salazar of Florida, Troy Nehls of Texas, Dale Strong of Alabama and Daniel Webster of Florida. None of the speakers made mention of Menendez, nor\u00a0of\u00a0the allegations of the Democrat\u2019s dealings with the Egyptian\u00a0government\u00a0and its functionaries.\u00a0Instead they summoned the likes of North Korea and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia to add a slap of color to the injustices, they said,\u00a0that\u00a0now confront\u00a0the former president. In the nearly nine months since Menendez was indicted \u2013 making him the first US\u00a0senator\u00a0to be charged in two separate criminal cases \u2013 his most\u00a0outspoken\u00a0critics have come from\u00a0within his own ranks. Democrats in New Jersey, including Sen. Cory Booker, have largely abandoned him. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did not call on Menendez to step down after the indictment landed, though he expressed contentment that his longtime colleague decided to cede his Foreign Relations Committee\u00a0post. More than any Republican, Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, has been the most vocal of any elected official in Washington, describing Menendez as \u201creally a senator for Egypt, not New Jersey.\u201d Late last year, he trolled\u00a0his colleague by hiring former New York Rep. George Santos, who had just been expelled from Congress over a dazzling assortment of\u00a0alleged\u00a0lies and\u00a0misdeeds, to record a video on the Cameo app calling for Menendez\u00a0to go. More recently,\u00a0Fetterman\u00a0mocked the senator\u2019s\u00a0defense, which relies in part on pointing the finger of blame on Nadine Menendez, his wife. \u201cI really can\u2019t imagine who \u2013 either it was his idea or he was convinced that blaming your wife, who is suffering from cancer, is really an effective strategy or how that\u2019s going to go over,\u201d Fetterman told on CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u00a0on\u00a0Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d (Per a press release from her husband, Nadine Menendez, who is also charged in the case and is set to be tried separately this summer, has been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and will undergo a mastectomy.) Republicans in Washington, as they\u2019ve done during these first two weeks of the Menendez trial in New York, have been consistently deferential to the New Jersey Democrat. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in September called the indictment \u201can issue for the Democrats to deal with.\u201d Other GOP officials went so far as\u00a0to encourage\u00a0Menendez, a staunch, pro-Israel foreign policy hawk, to hold on to his seat as long as he was able. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing for Republicans,\u201d North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer told Politico last year. \u201cHaving a Democrat who is so hawkish as a chairman is kind of an encouragement.\u201d Their tune, of course, could change if a Republican Senate candidate in New Jersey emerges as a serious contender. (The GOP primary hopefuls so far, however, largely appear to be toeing the Trump line \u2013 not exactly a winning strategy in the true-blue Garden State.) Menendez is not running for\u00a0reelection\u00a0in the Democratic primary and an independent bid, which he\u2019s teased, seems far-fetched. Rep. Andy Kim, a popular Democrat from South Jersey, is expected to win the nomination to\u00a0succeed Menendez. But on a steamy May morning in New York City, Menendez\u2019s fate\u00a0was, at most, a distant concern.\u00a0Andrew\u00a0Giuliani, pressed for a thought on the senator\u2019s trial or the allegations against him, shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a better explanation for the gold bars for the defense, I guess. But I just haven\u2019t been following it as much as this here,\u201d he said, asking a reporter, \u201cWhat is it,\u00a0in the second or third week?\u201d CNN\u2019s Sabrina Souza contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/politics/bob-menendez-trump-circus-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_politics_us-niger-troop-withdrawal-agreement", "text": "The US has reached an agreement with Niger to\u00a0withdraw its military forces\u00a0from the African nation by September 15, according to the US Defense Department and the Nigerien Ministry of National Defense. The newly agreed deadline gives the US four months to drawdown fewer than 1,000 troops who remain in the country, as well as their equipment, which includes MQ-9 Reaper drones and other assets. But even as the deadline looms, US officials see potential for a relationship with Niger. \u201cThey want to maintain a relationship with us,\u201d a senior defense official said, \u201cand that relationship is certainly informed by where we\u2019ve been with them.\u201d Niger\u2019s\u00a0military\u00a0government\u00a0announced in March\u00a0that it had ended an\u00a0accord\u00a0with\u00a0the US that allowed\u00a0military\u00a0personnel and civilian staff from the Department of Defense to operate in\u00a0the country. The US delegation met with Niger\u2019s ruling military junta last week to try to reach an agreement that would allow for the secure withdrawal of US forces and for clearances for military flights. The flight clearances had been a sticking point in the sensitive negotiations needed to withdraw US forces.\u00a0Until now, US troops who have left Niger took commercial flights, including as recently as last week, according to US officials. The remaining troops on the ground are tasked with drawing down US personnel and equipment still in Niger. The Defense Department has worked with the Nigerien military for more than a decade, focusing its efforts on counterterrorism in West Africa. The US previously operated out of two base \u2013 Agadez and Niamey \u2013 that allowed the Pentagon to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance missions with drones. Now, US forces are limited to the base in the capital of Niamey, where Russian forces have already begun operating. \u201cNiger has been really an anchor for our counterterrorism efforts over a decade,\u201d said the defense official, who said conversations on future cooperation are ongoing. But what that coordination looks like is an open question, especially as the US has already begun removing some of the 1,100 military personnel operating in the country. Defense officials painted an optimistic picture of a potential future relationship with Niger given the military junta\u2019s demand that the US withdraws its forces from the country. The Nigerien military \u201cdid not see this as the closing of the relationship,\u201d said a senior military official. The senior defense official and senior military official briefed reporters Sunday afternoon, following a series of meetings between US and Nigerien officials about the withdrawal. The US delegation was led by Chris Meier, the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. The Nigerien delegation was led by Col.-Maj. Mamane Sani Kiaou, the chief of staff of the Nigerian army. \u201cBoth delegations confirmed the guarantees of protection and security to the American forces during their withdrawal. The delegations also established procedures to facilitate the entry and exit of U.S. personnel, including overflight and landing clearances for military flights,\u201d the joint statement said. The US is still evaluating what military equipment will be left in Niger. \u201cObviously sensitive equipment, lethal equipment, hazardous equipment \u2013 these kinds of things will be removed,\u201d the defense official said. Much of what the US anticipates leaving behind will not be \u201cterribly mobile,\u201d the official said, describing it as housing equipment and other kinds of life support. While Russian forces have been operating at the same base from which US forces are withdrawing, the US officials said they consider it unlikely that American equipment might fall into Russian hands. \u201cWe got the strong sense in the conversations that they do not intend to share what equipment is left behind with any other party that might be here or in the future,\u201d the defense official said. \u201cAt least for the time being.\u201d The US and Niger said in their joint statement they would continue to work together on areas of \u201ccommon interest.\u201d \u201cThe United States and Niger are committed to ongoing diplomatic dialogue to define the future of their bilateral relations,\u201d the statement said.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_trump-trial-takeaways", "text": "The prosecution rested their case against Donald J. Trump on Monday in the former president\u2019s hush money trial, which is barreling toward a conclusion as soon as next week. Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony finally wrapped up Monday after four days \u2013 and 17 hours \u2013 on the witness stand as the final witness in the prosecution\u2019s case alleging that Trump falsified business records when he reimbursed Cohen for the hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign. It wasn\u2019t long after the defense began its case on Monday for things to get heated \u2013 Judge Juan Merchan admonished a witness for the defense, Robert Costello, and threatened to remove him from the stand\u00a0after he audibly complained when the judge sustained objections to the questions he was being asked. Merchan even cleared the courtroom of the press briefly after dressing down Costello. It was an unexpectedly contentious moment for a trial that is quickly nearing a close. While the defense appears likely to rest its case on Tuesday, Merchan said he\u2019s planning to have closing arguments next Tuesday, May 28, out of concern with having a four-day weekend for the jury when it could be deliberating (court is dark on Friday because of a juror\u2019s travel, and Monday is Memorial Day). Regardless of the break, the Trump hush money trial is near its end \u2013 and roughly a week away from being in the hands of the jury. Here are the takeaways from Day 19: Prosecution rests Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office rested their case Monday afternoon after calling 20 witnesses over the course of 15 days, including Cohen, Daniels, former Trump aide Hope Hicks and ex-publisher of the National Enquirer David Pecker. The trial started on April 15 with jury selection, and the prosecution\u2019s first witness, Pecker, was called a week later on April 22. Cohen was the key witness, spending more than 17 hours on the witness stand over four days before wrapping up on Monday. He testified in detail, accusing his former boss of directing him to pay Daniels\u2019 attorney in October 2016 and approving of the reimbursement plan at the heart of the criminal case. Under cross-examination, Trump attorney Todd Blanche sought to poke holes in Cohen\u2019s credibility, alleging that he made up conversations where he said Trump directed him to pay Daniels. Trump\u2019s former fixer\u2019s testimony may be the key in determining how the jury ultimately rules on the case. But over the course of roughly a month, prosecutors also introduced a host of evidence to try to corroborate his allegations that Trump directed Cohen\u2019s repayment, through both expert witnesses and documents. Defense witness infuriates the judge, who clears courtroom Trump\u2019s attorneys called Costello as a way to try to rebut Cohen\u2019s testimony about the pressure he was receiving in 2018 when the FBI searched his home and office. Costello advised Cohen in the weeks after the search, though Cohen did not sign a retainer agreement and did not pay Costello, who touted in email communications his close connections with Rudy Giuliani. The former New York mayor also joined Trump\u2019s legal team in 2018. Costello described his initial 2018 meeting with Cohen, in which he said Cohen told him, \u201cI swear to God, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump.\u201d But once on the stand, Costello quickly got on the wrong side of the judge, speaking over Merchan as the judge sustained objections in response to questions from Trump attorney Emil Bove. Then Costello began audibly protesting the sustained objections. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d he could be heard saying while the attorneys approached the judge after one objection. He later let out an audible \u201cjeez\u201d following the judge\u2019s ruling. After another sustained objection,\u202fCostello\u202flet out an audible sigh and rolled his eyes, side glancing at the judge. The judge then asked the jury to step out of the courtroom. Once jurors left, Merchan said, \u201cI want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom.\u201d \u201cWhen there\u2019s a witness on the stand, if you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019\u201d Merchan said to Costello. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me a side eye and you don\u2019t roll your eyes,\u201d Merchan said, his voice showing his anger. When\u202fCostello\u202fheld a long glare at the judge, Merchan asked, \u201cAre you staring me down?\u201d The judge then cleared the courtroom of the media, who were held in the hallways for several minutes. Inside the courtroom, Merchan threatened to remove Costello from the stand and strike his testimony. \u201cI\u2019m\u00a0putting you on notice that your conduct is contemptuous,\u201d\u00a0Merchan said to Costello, according to a transcript. \u201cIf\u00a0you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand.\u201d Costello tried to explain: \u201cCan I say something, please?\u201d \u201cNo. No,\u201d Merchan responded. \u201cThis is not a conversation.\u201d Once\u00a0the jury and the press were\u00a0let back inside, Bove\u2019s questions continued without incident, though the judge did urge Costello after several objections to just answer the question that had been asked and not elaborate further. Costello will be back on the stand when court resumes at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, under cross-examination by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger. Trial endgame comes into focus Trump\u2019s side began its defense case Monday afternoon \u2013 and the former president\u2019s lawyers appear likely to rest on Tuesday. The defense first called a paralegal to introduce call records between Cohen and Costello, before Costello took the stand. He\u2019s expected to be off the stand by mid-morning Tuesday, and Trump\u2019s attorneys said that \u2013 as of now \u2013 they don\u2019t plan to call any other witnesses after him. That would mean that Trump does not plan to testify in his own defense, although the judge noted that the plans from Trump\u2019s team could always change. Trump\u2019s team had also planned to call a campaign finance expert, but Merchan limited the expert\u2019s testimony, which apparently caused Trump\u2019s lawyers to change their mind. Merchan could have pushed to have closing arguments this week and give the case to the jury \u2013 but that left open a likely possibility that the jury would begin deliberations only to have a four-day weekend for Memorial Day (one of the jurors has a flight Friday so Merchan, has already said court will be dark that day). Instead, Merchan said he expects to have closings next Tuesday. Once the defense rests its case, he will hold a conference with the two parties to discuss the instructions the judge will give to the jury before deliberations. As a result, the trial could be dark for a week, although Merchan still has not said what will happen on Thursday. Cohen admits he stole from Trump Org. Cohen admitted in the final stretch of cross-examination Monday that he stole $60,000 from the Trump Organization by telling then-Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg he needed to be reimbursed for a payment he made on Trump\u2019s behalf to a tech company. Cohen said he had told various prosecutors about this, prompting Blanche to question why he had never been charged with larceny. Trump was engaged throughout this line of questioning, smirking when Cohen admitted to stealing. Hoffinger touched on the theft briefly during redirect examination to confirm that Cohen knew stealing was wrong. Cohen called it \u201cself-help\u201d because he was angry Trump shorted him on his bonus that year. \u201cI just felt it was almost like self-help. I wasn\u2019t going to let him have the benefit this way as well,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut you admitted on cross that it was wrong,\u201d Hoffinger asked. \u201cIt was,\u201d Cohen said. Cohen also acknowledged on cross-examination that he has a financial stake in the outcome of Trump\u2019s trial. \u201cI talk about it on my podcasts, I talk about it on TikTok, and they make money, and that\u2019s how I was viewing your question, whether Mr. Trump is ultimately determined innocent or guilty is not going to affect whether I speak about it or not,\u201d he said. Asked if he would make more money if Trump is found guilty, Cohen said: \u201cIt\u2019s better if he\u2019s not, for me, because it gives me more to talk about in the future.\u201d Hoffinger questioned Cohen for less than an hour on redirect examination midday Monday, hitting points to clarify what prosecutors felt Blanche might have muddied over three days of questioning Trump\u2019s former fixer. Cohen made clear that he had no doubt that Trump told him to work out his reimbursement with Weisselberg and that Trump gave him approval to make the payment to Daniels. \u201cWould you have paid Stormy Daniels the $130,000 had Mr. Trump not signed off?\u201d Hoffinger asked Cohen on redirect examination. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Cohen said. Hoffinger also replayed a recorded phone call between Cohen and Daniels\u2019 former lawyer Keith Davidson from 2018. Cohen can be heard saying, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t even tell you how many times he said to me, you know, \u2018I hate the fact that we did it.\u2019 And my comment to him was, \u2018But every person that you\u2019ve spoken to told you it was the right move.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe\u201d is Trump, Cohen testified, saying, \u201cI was referring to the payment to Keith Davidson that I made on behalf of Mr. Trump for the Stormy Daniels matter for the nondisclosure agreement.\u201d Cohen said that his life had been upended by the situation with Trump. \u201cI lost my law license, my businesses, my financial security,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMy family\u2019s happiness, which was probably paramount, just to name a few.\u201d Blanche, in another round of questioning, clarified with Cohen that he had also pleaded guilty to tax crimes unrelated to Trump and any felony would get a New York lawyer disbarred. Still, Cohen said he largely blames Trump. Hoffinger later tried to distance Cohen\u2019s federal guilty plea from his testimony at this trial. \u201cMy life was on the line, my liberty, and here I\u2019m just a non-party subpoenaed witness,\u201d Cohen said. Prosecutors, defense spar over Cohen call with Trump During their redirect of Cohen, prosecutors sought to push back on one of the most effective blows Blanche landed knocking his credibility, when he accused Cohen of making up a phone call with Trump ahead of the October 2016 payment to Daniels. Blanche had confronted Cohen with text messages suggesting he called Keith Schiller, Trump\u2019s former bodyguard, at 8:02 p.m. on October 24, 2016, about a harassing prank caller \u2013 and not to update Trump about the Daniels payment. Hoffinger sought to rebut that testimony with a photo pulled from C-SPAN\u2019s video of Trump\u2019s rally that same night \u2013 showing Schiller with Trump when he left the stage just five minutes before the Cohen call. That prompted a long fight between the two parties over admitting the photo into evidence \u2013 including plans to bring the C-SPAN archivist back from Louisiana \u2013 but it was ultimately admitted with a stipulation both sides agreed to. Once the photo was admitted into evidence, Cohen told Hoffinger he spoke with Trump \u201cmore than 20 times\u201d about Daniels in October 2016. Cohen testified that records \u201chelped to refresh my memory,\u201d about when he spoke to Trump\u202fabout\u00a0Daniels. The comment prompted a smile from Trump. Blanche questioned Cohen one more time about the Schiller call before Cohen left the witness stand, asking whether he really could have asked Schiller about the prank call from a teenager and updated Trump on Daniels all in the span of a 90-second call. \u201cYour testimony is still \u2026 just so I understand \u2026 in that 90 seconds you spoke with Mr. Schiller about the problem you were having with the 14-year-old, got him to agree to take care of it, told him you would send him the number, which you did, but also had time for Mr. Schiller to pass the phone to Mr. Trump and update him on everything going on?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Cohen said. In his final question, Blanche asked, \u201cYour testimony remains the same as you gave it last Tuesday, that notwithstanding everything that you said over the years, you have a specific recollection of having conversations on the phone with then-candidate Donald J. Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter?\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNo doubt in your mind?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d Cohen said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/trump-trial-takeaways/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

In a filing Monday evening, prosecutors laid out their case against Hunter Biden, which is scheduled to go to trial on June 3 in Delaware. Prosecutors described some of their key witnesses\u00a0and\u00a0what they plan to say on the stand, and they also released text messages and photos that they plan to show to the jury. The president\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to three crimes\u00a0in the gun case, all stemming from Weiss\u2019 claim that he was abusing drugs while he purchased and briefly possessed a revolver in 2018, which is against federal law. These revelations about Weiss\u2019 trial strategy and witness list underscore the extremely personal nature of this case, which will shine a national spotlight on what Hunter Biden has said was his rock bottom. Hunter Biden has been very open about\u00a0his\u00a0lifelong struggle\u00a0with alcohol and drug addiction. But to win a conviction, Weiss will need to bring that addiction to life for the jury, with compelling witnesses and photographic evidence, to prove in court that Hunter Biden was abusing drugs when he owned the gun. The expected prosecution witnesses include Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife\u00a0Kathleen Buhle;\u00a0his late brother\u2019s widow, whom he later also dated,\u00a0Hallie Biden; and\u00a0Lunden Roberts, an Arkansas native who has a daughter with Hunter Biden. The filings don\u2019t identify the women by name, but Weiss\u2019 description of their testimony matches other public details and court filings from related cases. Prosecutors say one witness,\u00a0who CNN has identified as Hallie Biden, will testify that Hunter Biden possessed the revolver in 2018 and that she took it from his car and threw it in a dumpster near a grocery store in Wilmington, Delaware. She would search \u201chis bags, backpacks, and vehicle in an effort to help him get sober, and discovered drug paraphernalia and drugs in his possessions on multiple occasions\u201d in 2018, prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors said in the filing that another witness,\u00a0who appears to be Roberts, will testify that she \u201cobserved the defendant using crack cocaine frequently \u2014 every 20 minutes except when he slept.\u201d The filing from prosecutors also includes scores of text messages they say are from Hunter Biden, including images of drugs,\u00a0as well as\u00a0messages about sobriety and meeting with drug dealers. \u201cThe government intends to show videos and photographs of the defendant smoking crack, or of crack or drug paraphernalia in videos/photographs backed up to the defendant\u2019s Apple iCloud account or laptop, or sent in the defendant\u2019s messages,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Other witnesses prosecutors will call include federal agents and\u00a0the gun store\u00a0employee\u00a0who allegedly sold Hunter Biden the pistol in 2018. One Drug Enforcement Administration agent, prosecutors say, will discuss coded terms and drug language they say Hunter Biden used in text messages with others, \u201csuch as \u2018baby powder,\u2019 \u2018Party Favor,\u2019 \u201810grams,\u2019 (and) \u2018chore boy.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/hunter-biden-exes-addiction-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "politics"}}
