{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_immigration-policy-biden-what-matters", "text": "In two weeks, the White House has swerved from taking tough action against asylum-seekers trying to enter the country illegally to taking strong action to show empathy for people who have lived for years in the US immigration shadows. It was in early June that President Joe Biden pulled from former President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook to severely limit protections for asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally, effectively trying to seal the border to them, and addressing a changing mood in the country with regard to asylum-seekers. That move angered many progressives and immigration advocates and drew a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. But those groups will now cheer Biden\u2019s move Tuesday, offering new protection to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants \u2013 specifically some spouses of US citizens and their children \u2013 who are already in the US. The move could grant legal status to about 500,000 American families, according to the White House. Biden promises empathy; Trump promises mass deportation The new executive action offers a major contrast with Trump, who is promising to deport more than 10 million people from the US if he\u2019s elected to a second term. At the White House, Biden argued Trump\u2019s deportation policy would \u201crip spouses and children from their families, homes and communities and place them in detention camps.\u201d From CNN\u2019s report by Michael Williams: Under current federal law, an undocumented person who enters the United States and marries a US citizen must first request parole before applying for legal residency. That process requires them to leave the country if they were there illegally, upending their careers and families and creating uncertainty about whether they would be authorized to reenter.  Tuesday\u2019s action allows those spouses to apply for residency without needing to leave the United States \u2013 a key change that the Biden administration argues will keep families intact. Read Williams\u2019 full report. Undocumented immigrants eligible for the program will have to apply, but they can stay in the US as the process unfolds. The must have been married by June 17, before the new action was announced, and they must have been in the US for at least 10 years. Is this necessary? One Biden critic argued the new policy is unnecessary since few long-standing undocumented immigrants who are married to a US citizen would ever be deported. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the problem that the Biden administration is trying to solve here, and I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d Chad Wolf, an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said on CNN. He did not address Trump\u2019s deportation pledge during the interview. Seeking \u2018balance\u2019 Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who is the first former undocumented immigrant elected to Congress, told CNN\u2019s Brianna \ufeffKeilar that while he does not support the asylum action announced earlier this month, the addition of protection for undocumented spouses and their children \u201cbalances that out in a real smart way.\u201d He argued the immigration debate is too large for one single fix. \u201cJust to do (border) enforcement or just to do what we\u2019re doing today alone is not an answer to the vast majority of the American people that are concerned about this,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cThe immigration debate is very broad,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and these are very specific items within that broader debate that are being addressed.\u201d Legal limbo Biden\u2019s move could also lack permanence. An important caveat to any immigration action is that since Congress continually fails to address the immigration issue, anything a president does with executive power might be reversed by the next administration or invalidated by courts. Look no further than the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program enacted by the Obama administration in June 2012, another strong executive action positioned for effect in an election year. Still proud of that policy, Biden announced his new program in conjunction with the 12th anniversary of DACA. Obama enacted DACA; Trump tried to end it The DACA policy was enacted after bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform efforts failed for the umpteenth time. It was meant to bring people brought to the US illegally as children, frequently referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d out of the shadows and allow them to build lives in the country where they grew up. Nearly 600,000 people have sought protected status under the program, which defers but does not necessarily end any immigration action against them. The Trump administration tried to end the DACA program in 2017, but the effort eventually failed at the Supreme Court in 2020. Instead, Trump hit pause on new applications, something the Biden administration then reversed. Would today\u2019s Supreme Court protect DACA? After the Biden administration tried to formalize the DACA process, a federal judge in 2021 agreed with Texas and other states that the program must be ended, again halting new DACA applications. That case is now under appeal and could land the DACA issue back at the Supreme Court. When a divided 5-4 court prevented the Trump administration from ending DACA in 2020,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal justice, was still on the court. She has been replaced by a conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In 2020, Chief Justice John Roberts infuriated conservatives by joining the liberal block of justices to rule against Trump on technical grounds. The new case and the new makeup of the court mean DACA is far from safe. Congress could, of course, fix all of this with action, but it has failed to pass comprehensive reform despite attempts that go back decades. The much more modest bipartisan effort pushed by Biden earlier this year would not have helped the undocumented spouses of citizens and their children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/immigration-policy-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

That is why we are providing assistance to print more than three million textbooks for Ukrainian elementary school students ahead of this school year.\u201d \u201cOur message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia\u2019s barbaric war of aggression,\u201d he said. The roughly $8 million in funding for the textbook printing comes as the Biden administration has adjusted its policies in an effort to fortify Ukraine\u2019s military fight against Russia. The administration has\u00a0shifted its policy to allow US weapons\u00a0to be used in strikes into Russian territory where Russian forces are engaging in cross-border attacks into Ukraine \u2013 a change that was first publicly acknowledged in late May as Ukraine worked to push back Russian advances toward the northeastern city of Kharkiv. The administration is also\u00a0prioritizing critical air defense capabilities\u00a0for Ukraine over other countries. \u201cThis all kind of fits together in terms of helping the Ukrainian military to defend its skies but also helping to ensure that Ukraine is able to educate its students and its children,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just support their military. Of course, we\u2019re doing that,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cBut we also recognize that Russia is trying to do something broader than that, which is target Ukraine\u2019s culture and history and identity and we need to respond to that as well.\u201d In late May, Ukraine\u2019s largest printing facility, Faktor Druk, was hit in a Russian missile attack on Kharkiv. The US assessed that it will take six to eight months for Ukraine to repair Faktor Druk, according to the official. The day after the attack, in a daily internal meeting on Ukraine, Sullivan directed his team to address the fallout from the strike, making it \u201can urgent priority\u201d for the US to help ensure that the educational materials make it to the Ukrainian students, the official told CNN. After coordination between the National Security Council, US Embassy in Kyiv, US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ukrainian government, it was decided that by \u201cusing existing resources and programs\u201d the US, through USAID, will provide roughly $8 million to fund the printing of the textbooks, the official said. \u201cWe really focused in on hardcover textbooks for first and second graders in Ukraine as an area where they identified the most urgent need, and working with them to identify facilities where these materials can be prepared and printed,\u201d the official said. \u201cSo we really sprang into action in that regard and also sprang into action to allocate supplemental resources to go toward this initiative.\u201d The 3.2 million textbooks will be manufactured at other Ukrainian printing houses in time for the start of the school year in September 2024, the official described. They will be distributed \u201cto approximately 12,700 schools throughout Ukraine,\u201d they added. The Ukrainian Ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, called the funding for printing the textbooks \u201cextremely timely and very much valued by the people of Ukraine.\u201d \u201cIt is especially important that funding will be provided to Ukrainian printing houses. It is another investment in our future, and our fight for justice and humanity,\u201d she said in a statement to CNN. \u201cLike so much needed support with defense and weapons, this is yet another sign of strong strategic friendship between our nations.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_biden-campaign-abortion-ad-trump", "text": "The Biden campaign is blasting former President Donald Trump over abortion rights in a new TV ad coinciding with the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade and days ahead of the first presidential debate. The ad, which was first shared with CNN, features a testimonial from Kaitlyn Joshua, a Louisiana woman who says she was turned away from two emergency rooms while experiencing a miscarriage at 11 weeks of pregnancy. She describes her experience as \u201ca direct result of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade\u201d and slams presumptive GOP presidential nominee. \u201cHe\u2019s now a convicted felon,\u201d Joshua says in the ad as an image of Trump in court flashes across the screen. \u201cTrump thinks he should not be held accountable for his own criminal actions,\u00a0but he will let women and doctors be punished.\u201d (The former president was convicted in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and faces sentencing next month.) \u201cWe want to support someone that does have our best interests at heart, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so adamant about supporting President Biden,\u201d adds Joshua, who is set to join second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Monday for a Michigan event marking the second anniversary of Roe\u2019s reversal. The 30-second spot highlights an issue the campaign sees as key to rallying voters, especially the young and female blocs that are crucial to his reelection chances. The ad, which marks the second time President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has used Trump\u2019s felony conviction in its advertising, will run on television and internet-connected TV in battleground states and on national cable as part of the campaign\u2019s $50 million ad push in June. The new advertisement is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s efforts to highlight reproductive rights around the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which it has tied to Trump\u2019s appointments of conservative justices. \u201cTwo years ago today, Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court majority ripped away the fundamental freedom for women to access the health care they need and deserve,\u201d Biden said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe consequences have been devastating: in states across the country, Trump\u2019s allies have enacted extreme and dangerous abortion bans \u2013 many with no exception for rape or incest \u2013 that are putting women\u2019s lives at risk and threatening doctors with jail time.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is the sole person responsible for this nightmare,\u201d the president added. \u201cIf given the chance, there is no question he will ban abortion nationwide, with or without the help of Congress.\u201d Trump earlier this year said abortion legislation should be left up\u00a0to the states, saying in\u00a0April,\u00a0\u201cMy view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both.\u201d Following the Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 decision that overturned the federal legal right to an abortion,\u00a0nearly two dozen states\u00a0have banned or limited access to the procedure. States where abortion is most limited\u00a0report\u00a0higher rates\u00a0of maternal and infant mortality, as well as\u00a0greater economic insecurity. The Biden campaign and White House are also bracing for a major Supreme Court decision on emergency abortion access. The administration has challenged Idaho\u2019s enforcement of its abortion ban in medical emergencies, and justices appeared deeply divided as they heard oral arguments in the case in April. Biden\u2019s advisers believe reproductive rights remain a potent political issue heading into November\u2019s election and could feature as a key contrast point in the president\u2019s debate with Trump at CNN\u2019s studios in Atlanta on Thursday. Biden is spending the days leading up to the showdown at Camp David, where he is expected to run through 90-minute mock debates as part of his preparations to face off against Trump in person for the first time since 2020. In a memo previewing the campaign\u2019s strategy ahead of the debate, communications director Michael Tyler argued Trump \u201ccontinues to pose the most extreme threat\u201d on abortion rights, democracy and the economy. While Biden prepares for the debate, his campaign is hosting more than 50 events across the country around Monday\u2019s anniversary of the\u00a0Dobbs decision. First lady Jill Biden attended two \u201cWomen for Biden-Harris\u201d events in Pennsylvania on Sunday, and Vice President Kamala Harris will mark the anniversary with events in Maryland and Arizona on Monday.

Here\u2019s how to watch the debate: When and where will the debate take place? The 90-minute debate will take place on Thursday, June 27, at 9 p.m. ET at the network\u2019s Atlanta studios. Who is moderating? CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the event. Where and how can I watch it? The CNN Presidential Debate will air\u00a0live on CNN, CNN International and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and via streaming on Max for subscribers and without a cable login\u00a0on\u00a0CNN.com. CNN will make the debate available to simulcast on additional broadcast and cable news networks. You can also follow\u00a0CNN\u2019s live debate coverage on\u00a0CNN.com, which will include analysis and fact checking. What were the qualifications? Biden and Trump will be the only presidential candidates participating in the debate. In order to qualify, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. According to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Biden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements. The pair has also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10. What are the rules of the debate? The debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. The candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_sotomayor-dobbs-obergefell-supreme-court-analysis-biskupic", "text": "Since the Supreme Court reversed constitutional abortion rights two years ago, the conservative majority has avoided referring to that decision while dissenting liberals have at times invoked it in rebuke or to warn of other rights that may fall. Ahead of the dramatic final week of the current session, liberals\u00a0on Friday\u00a0fired a startling new warning shot in what was otherwise a low-profile dispute over a Salvadoran husband\u2019s immigrant visa. Justice Sonia Sotomayor cited the\u00a05-4 decision in Dobbs\u00a0v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization as she asserted the majority was threatening marriage rights, particularly same-sex marriage as established in the 2015 case of Obergefell v. Hodges.\u00a0Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined the dissent. The Dobbs majority had asserted that its elimination of abortion rights \u201cdoes not undermine \u2026 in any way\u201d other entrenched rights, such as those involving contraception or\u00a0marriage, Sotomayor wrote. Despite\u00a0that assurance, \u201cthe Court fails at the first pass.\u201d As the dueling sides spoke past each other, there may have been a larger message of liberal frustration and despair. That could reflect what the liberal justices know is coming in cases soon to be announced. It could also reflect\u00a0foreboding for the next set of issues that relate\u00a0to same-sex marriage, including those intersecting\u00a0with Dobbs, such as in\u00a0vitro fertilization and other reproductive interests. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who wrote the 6-3 decision in the visa case Friday, deemed Sotomayor\u2019s\u00a0dissenting opinion an overreaction to a straightforward\u00a0immigration\u00a0dispute, which landed before the justices on appeal by the Biden administration. \u201cThe dissent never addresses the actual issue in this case, which is whether the Judiciary has any authority to review visa determinations made by the State Department,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cInstead, the dissent chooses the rhetorically easier path of charging the Court with endangering the fundamental right to marriage. To be clear: Today\u2019s decision does not remotely call into question any precedent of this Court, including those protecting marriage as a fundamental right.\u201d The case\u00a0may\u00a0indeed be confined to the immigration realm. Yet, the right-wing pattern of diminishing individual rights lurks in the background. And the liberals\u2019 defiant statement may foreshadow divisions\u00a0this week\u00a0as the justices try to complete their 2023-24 session. Among the cases to be announced as soon as Wednesday is a significant test of access to abortion. That dispute from Idaho centers on a federal law intended to ensure emergency room treatment for people in need. The case tests whether in states that now ban abortion, the law would cover women requiring the procedure due to serious complications. The case will mark the high court\u2019s first substantive action on abortion access since its Dobbs decision, issued on June 24, 2022. The ruling overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade milestone and allowed states to begin outlawing abortion. Other cases to be decided in the next few days\u00a0include\u00a0those arising from the actions of former President Donald Trump after the 2020\u00a0election, notably\u00a0whether he\u00a0should be immune from criminal prosecution related to his efforts to\u00a0overturn\u00a0the election results. Another pending\u00a0dispute may reverse a 40-year-old case, Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which gave US agencies considerable latitude to enforce regulations, for example, over the environment and public health. That precedent has been a target of the business community, as well as conservative justices. Turning an immigration case into a \u2018broad holding on marriage\u2019 Reversal of Roe v. Wade, a goal sought for decades by the anti-abortion movement but unachievable until the appointment of three Trump justices, immediately unsettled reproductive care and has since dominated cultural and political spheres. Dobbs has ignited new debate over reproductive issues, including in vitro fertilization, and remains a flashpoint for\u00a0the 2024 presidential election. As much as it has permeated American life, Dobbs has been rarely cited at the high court, especially by the conservative justices who made it the law. When liberals have quoted from their dissent in the case, it has mainly been to admonish the majority\u2019s approach to precedent. Last year, for example, when the conservative majority reversed another milestone that dated to the 1970s (the Bakke decision that allowed racial affirmative action in college admissions), the three liberals invoked the Dobbs dissent to condemn another \u201creckless course.\u201d What they wrote Friday, however, ratcheted up the rhetoric and could be a clarion call for what they see on the horizon for substantive rights, if not in the next few days, then in upcoming sessions. The visa case, which had come to the justices with comparatively little national attention, was brought by Sandra Munoz, who argued she had a constitutional liberty interest in a consular officer\u2019s denial of a visa for her husband. Immigration law bars anyone an officer believes would engage in \u201cunlawful activity,\u201d and Munoz and her husband thought, according to the record in the case, he was rejected because he was suspected of membership in the MS-13 criminal gang.\u00a0(He has denied affiliation with MS-13 or any other gang.) The constitutional question was whether a US citizen has a fundamental liberty interest in their noncitizen spouse being admitted to the United States. (A lower federal court, the California-based 9th\u00a0US Circuit Court of Appeals, had ruled that a constitutionally protected liberty interest existed in such situations.) As Barrett\u2019s opinion reversed the 9th\u00a0Circuit, she relied on the federal government\u2019s long-standing authority to decide the admission and exclusion of noncitizens. Then, using a 1997 case as a touchstone, she pointed to the absence of a \u201chistory and tradition\u201d of any right to bring a spouse into the country. To liberal dissenters, Barrett\u2019s approach to any possible marriage right based on the 1997 case, rather than the 2015 Obergefell\u00a0case, turned what could have been a narrow procedural decision into \u201ca broad holding on marriage.\u201d Sotomayor said the majority was making \u201cthe same fatal error it made in Dobbs\u201d as\u00a0it weighed the liberty interest at stake. Rather than adopting a legal approach \u201cthat this Court has used in discussing the fundamental rights of marriage and intimacy,\u201d Sotomayor noted, the majority employed a less protective framework from the 1997 case of Washington v. Glucksberg, which tested (and rejected) a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. \u201cAlmost 10 years ago, this Court vindicated the expansiveness of the right to marriage,\u201d Sotomayor emphasized Friday before highlighting the individual lives affected: \u201cIt upheld the right of James Obergefell and his terminally ill husband, John Arthur, to have their marriage from Maryland recognized in Ohio. Rejecting the idea that Ohio can erase Obergefell\u2019s marriage to John Arthur for all time by declining to place Obergefell as the surviving spouse on Arthur\u2019s death certificate, this Court reasoned that marriage is a right older than the Bill of Rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/sotomayor-dobbs-obergefell-supreme-court-analysis-biskupic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_arizona-election-worker-arrested-maricopa-county", "text": "A temporary election worker in Arizona was arrested Saturday after allegedly stealing a security fob and keys from the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Arizona, and Maricopa County specifically, has been a hotbed for election conspiracy theories since 2020. The Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office said in a Monday statement that the fact Maricopa officials identified this security incident showed that election safety protocols in the county are working. It came amid concerns the incident could be used to further enflame conspiracy theories in the state. Maricopa County Sheriff Russ Skinner told reporters at a Phoenix news conference Tuesday that authorities \u201cdon\u2019t have any indication at this point\u201d that the incident was politically motivated but that they were \u201cnot ruling it out.\u201d Walter Ringfield, who identified himself to police as a temporary employee of the tabulation center, faces charges of theft and criminal damage. He remains in the custody of the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office as he awaits his next court appearance due to an unrelated pending felony case against him, a local official confirmed to CNN. According to court documents, Ringfield was captured on surveillance video walking past a desk and multiple tabulators just after 5 p.m. local time on June 20. The surveillance video then shows Ringfield stopping at the desk, grabbing a lanyard with the security fob and keys attached, and placing them in his pocket, court documents say. Ringfield was confronted by his elections supervisor about taking the security fob and keys, and he allowed security to search his car. Arizona detectives ultimately executed a search warrant of Ringfield\u2019s home, where the fob was located. Bill Gates, a Maricopa County supervisor, said at the news conference Tuesday that the fob had been taken during a testing of the tabulation machines in preparation for the state\u2019s upcoming July 30 primary. The fob is part of a multi-layer security process and the fob alone would not be able to turn on a tabulation machine, Gates said. Gates said officials had briefed the county Republican and Democratic parties on the incident. He insisted that it \u201cshould not have any impact whatsoever\u201d on the primary. According to investigators, the security fobs are used in conjunction with special secure tablets during the election. Because one was removed, every fob and tablet must be reprogrammed, court documents say. A director at the elections office told investigators the estimated cost of replacing the security fobs and tablets would be more than $19,000. \u201cThe secure operation of the facility is greatly impeded until the reprogramming is completed,\u201d court documents note. Skinner said Tuesday that investigators are still combing through digital evidence and items taken via a search warrant. Skinner said investigators are also reviewing the suspect\u2019s social media and that they \u201cdon\u2019t have anything that necessarily ties into anything beyond what we have at this point.\u201d During his initial court appearance Saturday, Ringfield was informed that he would remain in custody until his next court appearance, scheduled for Thursday, because of another pending felony case against him, video from his arraignment shows. Ringfield appeared surprised when the judge notified him of the other pending case and said it was his understanding the unrelated matter had already been resolved. It was not immediately clear whether Ringfield has an attorney. In a statement to CNN, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office said the incident at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center \u201cshould reassure the public about the effectiveness of the security measures in place.\u201d \u201cOur systems are not only designed to detect anomalies but are also supported by dedicated professionals committed to upholding the democratic process. While this event is unwelcome, it speaks the effectiveness of the security protocols built into Arizona\u2019s election systems,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe swift actions of the Maricopa County elections staff, including the re-conducting of logic and accuracy tests, builds in extra layers of protection of all affected equipment. This quick response will prevent any potential impact on the upcoming elections,\u201d the office added. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl", "text": "When people ask me how good of a player Willie Mays was, I give them a perhaps odd answer. The San Francisco Giants basically gave Mays to the New York Mets for practically nothing in 1972, and a well past his prime 41-year-old Mays was the best overall hitter \u2013 as measured by his ability to get on base and hit for power \u2013 on that solid Mets squad. Of course, the more normal way to know how good Mays was is that he remains, statistically, the best player who played his entire career in the last century and is in the Hall of Fame. But if you truly want to know how great Mays was? You had to watch him play. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of my Father when I learned of Mays\u2019 passing last night on \u201cThe Source.\u201d I mentioned him almost immediately. You see, my Father watched Mays play when he came up as a rookie for the New York Giants in 1951. He considered Mays the best player he ever saw from the moment he laid eyes on him in that inaugural year. Mays supercharged that \u201851 Giants squad and helped them overcome a 13.5-game deficit in mid-August to win the NL pennant over their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, thanks to the Shot Heard \u2018Round the World. It remains, in my opinion, the greatest comeback in baseball history. Mays won Rookie of the Year that season. It was three years later, however, when Mays became a baseball legend. After serving in the military for over a season, the man nicknamed the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d \u2013 who had a great song written about him playing on that name \u2013 dominated the National League. He led the league in batting average, slugging percentage (a measure of power), triples (one of the ultimate measures of speed and power) and on-base plus slugging (OBPS), which combines all of it into one metric. And yet, I don\u2019t think most remember Mays\u2019 1954 MVP season for his offensive exploits; people like my Father remember him for a play he made during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. Let me set the scene: the game is tied 2-2 in the eighth inning. The Cleveland Indians have runners on first and second with no one out. Cleveland power hitter Vic Wertz is at the plate, and he hits a long fly ball into the truly cavernous center field at the Polo Grounds in New York. Mays, who roamed center field for over 20 seasons, went back more than 400 feet and made a difficult, over-the-shoulder catch seem easy. He then fired the ball back into the infield to ensure that no runs would score. The Giants would go on to win the game and sweep the series in four games. It was their swan song in New York, as they moved to the West Coast after the 1957 season. Mays never understood why people thought that catch was amazing. For him, it was relatively routine. What was unique about this catch, beyond being in the World Series, was that video cameras captured it in an era from which we don\u2019t have many recordings. That short splice of film is our version of getting to see Mays play. It\u2019s our rare glimpse into a man whose defensive prowess was far more than that one catch. Mays was the best defensive player at any position that entire season in the National League, according to advanced statistics. He is, by those same metrics, a top-five defensive outfielder of all time, and those statistics \u2013 given we don\u2019t have a lot of video from the era \u2013 don\u2019t even really take into account his obviously great arm. The fact that I\u2019m talking about the defense of a man who for a long period of time was third all-time in home runs \u2013 and remains sixth \u2013 tells you everything you need to know. Mays wasn\u2019t just defense, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about hitting for power, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just hitting for average, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about speed, even though he excelled at that and led the league in stolen bases four times. Mays was everything \u2013 and he was so for over 20 years. Mays was, as my friend and esteemed sports columnist Neil Paine calculated, the most complete ballplayer in history. Baseball fans talk about finding five-tool players \u2013 those who hit for power and average, have speed and defensive abilities in terms of range and arm \u2013 like a miner trying to find gold. Well, we found our gold in Mays. But again, Mays is more than just numbers. He was one of our last links to multiple eras of baseball history. Mays oversaw the expansion of baseball to the West Coast in 1958, when it had previously been played on the Major League level only east of the Mississippi River. He was the first superstar on the West Coast. Mays was also the last superstar with us who made his name playing in New York during the 1950s. It was baseball\u2019s golden era; a time when America came out of World War II with a booming economy and during which baseball continued to outrank football as America\u2019s favorite sport and pastime. And if Mays wasn\u2019t good enough, he actually added a few hits to his storied, record-book career a few weeks ago when Negro League statistics were integrated into the MLB record books. Mays was one of the last living stars who started his career in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for Birmingham Black Barons. I like to joke that Mays was so great that he was still compiling hits at the age of 93. Indeed, he remained a hit with anyone who saw him play. Long after his career was over, Mays \u2013 when he would come back to New York \u2013 lived down the street from us in the Bronx. My Father would see him on walks and knew he had to get his autograph. Mays gave my Dad that autograph, and he kept it in his office until he passed. Mays is a big reason why my Father was one of the few people who wore a New York Giants baseball cap throughout his later years. I bought at least three of them for my Dad because he had one on his head all the time and literally wore them out. It\u2019s a connection I try to carry on to this day whether it\u2019s by wearing a New York Giants baseball hat on television or by answering \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d when asked what baseball team I root for. Now, excuse me as I go try and find that Mays autograph to honor the greatest player anyone I know saw play.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_student-loan-repayment-plan-halted", "text": "Two federal court judges in Kansas and Missouri have paused parts of a student loan repayment plan that the Biden administration launched last year, which lowers borrowers\u2019 monthly payments and provides a faster route to debt forgiveness. Two lawsuits filed by Republican-led states argue that the Biden administration overstepped its authority when it implemented the SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education) repayment plan. Both judges granted partial preliminary injunctions Monday. Two parts of the SAVE plan will be on pause until the cases are fully litigated. The Biden administration cannot cancel any more federal student debt for borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan. Under the plan, borrowers qualify for debt forgiveness once they make at least 10 years of payments. To date, $5.5 billion has been canceled for 414,000 people enrolled in SAVE. The Biden administration will also be blocked from implementing further provisions of the SAVE plan. In July, millions of people were expecting to see their payments lowered \u2013 but it\u2019s now unclear whether those reductions will occur. \u201cToday\u2019s rulings won\u2019t stop our Administration from using every tool available to give students and borrowers the relief they need,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Monday night in which she criticized the rulings and said the Department of Justice would work to defend the plan. On Tuesday, Jean-Pierre said in a post on X that the Department of Justice will appeal both decisions. \u201cWhile we continue to review these rulings, the SAVE plan still means lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers - including more than 4 million borrowers who owe no payments at all, and protections for borrowers facing runaway interest when they are making their monthly payments,\u201d Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement late Monday. SAVE is one of Biden\u2019s key student loan policies After the Supreme Court knocked down President Joe Biden\u2019s signature student loan forgiveness program last summer, his administration launched the SAVE plan. Like existing income-driven repayment plans, SAVE ties monthly payments to a borrower\u2019s income and family size. But the SAVE plan offers the most generous terms, especially for low-income borrowers. More than 8 million borrowers have enrolled in SAVE so far, and 4.6 million of them have a $0 monthly payment. Borrowers enrolled in SAVE may also be eligible for student debt relief in a shorter amount of time than under other income-driven plans. Those who borrowed $12,000 or less will see their debt forgiven after paying for just 10 years under SAVE. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount would add one year of monthly payments to the required time a borrower must pay. Under other repayment plans, borrowers must make at least 20 years of payments before receiving debt forgiveness. The SAVE plan also prevents balances from ballooning due to interest when a borrower has a small monthly payment. If enrolled in SAVE, unpaid interest does not accrue if a borrower makes a fully monthly payment. For example, if $50 in interest accumulates each month and a borrower\u2019s full required payment is just $30, the remaining $20 would be waived. SAVE is separate from the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to cancel student loan debt for some public-sector workers and borrowers who were defrauded by a for-profit college. What\u2019s next for borrowers Borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE can remain in the plan while the merits of the cases are heard. Their monthly payment amounts should remain the same. But there\u2019s a provision of the SAVE plan that was expected to be phased in next month that may be paused if the litigation is ongoing. Starting in July, payments on loans borrowed for undergraduate school were set to be reduced from 10% to 5% of discretionary income for those enrolled in SAVE. And borrowers who have loans from both undergraduate and\u00a0graduate school were expecting to pay a weighted average of between 5% and 10% of their income based upon the original principal balances of their loans. Also, no more student debt will be canceled for borrowers enrolled in SAVE, for now, even if the required number of monthly payments has been made. What the lawsuits say Eleven states, led by Kansas, filed the first lawsuit in late March and another group of seven states led by Missouri filed one soon after. Some of the states are among\u00a0the plaintiffs who sued the Biden administration two years ago over its sweeping, one-time\u00a0student loan forgiveness program. In the legal challenge led by Kansas, the complaint argues that the SAVE plan \u201ctransforms many or most loans into outright grants from the federal government \u2014 without any appropriation from Congress.\u201d In 1993, Congress gave the Department of Education the power to create different repayment plans for borrowers with federal student loans. But the lawsuits say the Biden administration\u2019s SAVE plan goes too far. \u201cCongress never gave Biden the authority to saddle working Americans with half-a-trillion dollars in other people\u2019s debt. A huge win for the Constitution,\u201d Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said on X Monday. The\u00a0estimated cost of the SAVE plan varies, depending on how many borrowers end up enrolling, ranging from\u00a0$138 billion\u00a0to\u00a0$475 billion\u00a0over 10 years, according to different studies. In comparison, Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program was expected to cost about $400 billion.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_marco-rubio-trump-vp-pick-hopeful", "text": "It was 2022 and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had just finished debating\u00a0his\u00a0Democratic opponent Val Demings when former President Donald Trump was on the line. According to a source familiar with the conversation, Trump was calling to relish in Rubio\u2019s performance, telling the\u00a0Republican\u00a0senator\u00a0that\u00a0he\u2019d done well and offering to do whatever he needed in the closing days of his campaign to make sure Rubio went back to\u00a0Capitol Hill. Weeks later, Trump appeared at a massive rally in Miami, telling the audience,\u00a0\u201cYou need Marco Rubio fighting for you in the US\u00a0Senate. He is fantastic.\u201d It was a remarkable shift for two men who just six years earlier had been bitterly entrenched in a primary battle for the White House, but also reflects Rubio\u2019s\u00a0ultimate embrace of Trump, whom he learned to work with closely in\u00a0his\u00a0presidency. For Rubio, the last eight years have been an education. In failure. In humility. In navigating a Republican Party overtaken by Trump and a job he was once desperate to leave.\u00a0The story of Rubio\u2019s transformation is not entirely unique for a member of Congress or even a one time foe, but reflects the political reality that surviving in the party at odds with Trump is no longer an option for members who want a future beyond him. And now, as he finds himself\u00a0on the shortlist of candidates who could be selected as Trump\u2019s running mate, Rubio\u2019s evolution is both a liability and perhaps his greatest asset. The Florida\u00a0senator, who nearly left the body after he was defeated in the GOP\u00a0presidential\u00a0primary in 2016,\u00a0has spent the last eight years rebuilding his image in the likeness of a populist in Washington. At the same time, he has sharpened his foreign policy credentials as the leading Republican on the\u00a0Senate\u00a0Intelligence Committee, while building relationships in his party, across the aisle and around the globe. In interviews with lawmakers, aides and GOP strategists,\u00a0many see Rubio as a clear messenger and a figure who could be a reliable conduit to the White House, a key negotiating partner, and in the eyes of Republicans, maybe even a steadying force for Trump if he returns to the West Wing next year. But Rubio, 53, is hardly the same politician whom Time magazine once dubbed \u201cThe Republican Savor\u201d on its cover, nor the person who pitched himself to GOP voters in 2016 as the son of Cuban immigrants and a living demonstration that the American dream was alive and well. Rubio now defends his change, saying the 2016 campaign was an education and one that changed his outlook and approach to politics. Trump was part of it. But Rubio argues that isn\u2019t the whole story. \u201cI got to go to places I\u2019d never been and meet people I\u2019d never interacted with and realized there\u2019s millions of millions of Americans out there for whom the American dream I believed in and was so enthusiastic about, a lot of them thought it was increasingly out of reach. They\u2019d lost their jobs because they got sent to China. They lived in a town where everywhere some shuttered factory or\u00a0boarded-up\u00a0Main Street shop reminded them of a once vibrant town that was hollowed out,\u201d Rubio told CNN in an interview. \u201cYou know in time, you grow to appreciate how Trump gave voice to that sentiment that needed to be heard and that needed to transform our party,\u201d he added. Still, some former supporters who once saw great promise in Rubio as part of a new generation of Republicans now view him as an example of a GOP that has lost its way. \u201cHe\u2019s made a 180-degree transition from being a center-right Republican with certain issues he championed like immigration, to becoming a total Donald Trump follower,\u201d said Al Cardenas, a former Florida Republican Party chairman and one time mentor to Rubio. \u201cHe\u2019s not the only one who made the transition.\u201d From \u2018Republican savior\u2019 to Trump convert The Rubio of today looks very different from the freshman senator plotting his way to the White House more than a decade ago. Back then, Rubio was in his early 40s and already viewed in Florida as an ambitious climber. At age 28, he jumped at the chance to run for Florida\u2019s House of Representatives, leaving behind the West Miami City Council seat he was just sworn into the year prior. He steadily rose up the party leadership in Tallahassee, eventually becoming speaker of the House. Termed out of his seat in 2010, he decided to run for US Senate, pitting himself against his party\u2019s own governor, Charlie Crist. By capturing tea party fervor, Rubio eventually pushed Crist to run as an independent and emerged victorious in the three-way race. \u201cIf you look at his political climb, it\u2019s an impressive climb,\u201d said Cardenas, who once employed Rubio at his law firm. \u201cHe came from being a humble kid, who graduated from law school and barely eked out a victory in a small municipal race. Now he\u2019s a US senator for one of the three biggest states in the country. Anyone looking at it from the outside would say that\u2019s a very impressive rise.\u201d The establishment and GOP donors were reckoning with how to become a more inclusive, big tent party, with immigration reform seen by many \u2013 including a young Rubio\u00a0\u2013 as a way to make inroads with Latino voters who had voted in droves for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney. Rubio took the opportunity in stride, helping negotiate a massive, bipartisan immigration bill that would have invested more than $40 billion in border security and legalized millions of immigrants living in the US\u00a0unlawfully at the time. The bill passed the Senate, but then stalled out in the House. Rubio distanced himself from it. Then, as Trump emerged on the scene, the trajectory of the party and Rubio\u2019s own path began to shift. \u201cClearly he has evolved along with the rest of the party on issues like immigration and is far more populist,\u201d one former Rubio aide told CNN. \u201cBut, I think he would argue the facts on the ground have changed too.\u201d When Rubio declared his candidacy for president \u2013 even as his friend former Gov. Jeb Bush was laying the groundwork for a run of his own \u2013 the then-junior senator from Florida announced his decision first on a call with donors before a rally in MIami. \u201cMy candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad,\u201d Rubio said when he announced his candidacy. \u201cIn many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country \u2026 where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege.\u201d But in the closing days of his campaign, Rubio spared no schoolyard attack on Trump, saying he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cmake America great. He\u2019s gonna make America orange,\u201d mocking the size of Trump\u2019s hands and calling him a \u201ccon artist\u201d vying to take over the Republican Party. In his concession speech in 2016, Rubio appeared to grapple in real time with what had become apparent in the primary:\u00a0Voters weren\u2019t interested in expanding the tent of the GOP with a hopeful message, they were attracted to Trump\u2019s bluster and his populist message. \u201cPeople are angry. They are frustrated and left behind by this economy and then they are told, \u2018Look, if you are against illegal immigration, that makes you a bigot,\u2019\u201d Rubio said. \u201cQuite frankly there are millions people in this country that are tired of being looked down upon.\u201d And in the intervening years since, Rubio and Trump\u2019s relationship has not only thawed, it\u2019s flourished. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him before he ran. I got to work with him and grew to respect the way he functioned as\u00a0president, but when he first ran I didn\u2019t know anything about him other than I knew he was famous and well known, but I didn\u2019t know him as a person,\u201d Rubio said. Asked how he could go from being the butt of Trump\u2019s attacks in 2016 to being as close as he is with Trump today, Rubio fired back, \u201cthat was a campaign.\u201d \u201cThat is like asking a boxer why they punched somebody in the face in the third round. It\u2019s because they were boxing. Doesn\u2019t mean you hate the guy, but we were in a competition for the same job,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe other people are different, but if he was a Democrat and we had a tough campaign wouldn\u2019t everybody be insisting we come back and work together, right? So why not expect that and then some when it\u2019s a Republican?\u201d Mike Fasano, a former state House majority leader in Florida, said he\u2019s unsurprised by Rubio\u2019s political shift. Fasano named Rubio to his leadership team soon after he arrived in Tallahassee, hoping the \u201cshining star of the Republican Party\u201d would also help carry the banner of Ronald Reagan conservativism to a new generation of voters. Instead, Fasano said, \u201cI found out soon after that he went where the wind blew.\u201d \u201cI would have a problem with anyone who demeans me like he was during that campaign when he ran for president,\u201d Fasano said. \u201cAnd then to suck up like he is doing now? But Marco is the type of person who will do that. He\u2019s always been like that. Whatever it takes.\u201d A return to the Senate Rubio returned to DC in the spring of 2016 defeated and intent on quitting politics. His frustrations with Washington at the time had reached a tipping point after just one term in the Senate. And, as one of the upper chamber\u2019s least wealthy members, he appeared ready to cash in with a private-sector gig. None of the Florida Republicans eying his seat (which included a little-known\u00a0congressional back bencher named Ronald DeSantis) much impressed GOP donors and leadership. To try\u00a0to\u00a0change his mind, the\u00a0US\u00a0Chamber of Commerce deployed one of its board members, Frank VanderSloot, an Idaho nutritional-supplement mogul who had helped bankroll Rubio\u2019s White House bid. The two met at Rubio\u2019s office, where VanderSloot said he told Rubio: \u201cAmerica needs him to stay in the Senate.\u201d Rubio would later attribute his change of heart to the deadly mass shooting at Pulse, a popular night club for LGBTQ people in Orlando. The shooter killed 49 people, mostly gay men, and wounded 53 others. Rubio, who has spent his time in public office arguing against gun restrictions and opposing\u00a0same-sex\u00a0marriage, nevertheless told a conservative radio host at the time that he was \u201cdeeply impacted\u201d by the tragedy and that made him reconsider \u201cwhere you are most useful to your country.\u201d Twelve days after the shooting, Rubio jumped back into the race just ahead of the filing deadline. Trump and Rubio\u2019s relationship also evolved quickly. While they sparred publicly on stage, after Trump won, he had Rubio to the White House for dinner, a turning point. And throughout his presidency, Trump relied on Rubio\u2019s expertise of Latin America to help guide him on issues related to\u00a0Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia. \u201cWe used to joke that his side job was being the Western Hemisphere desk coordinator,\u201d one former aide told CNN, noting that Trump called frequently to gauge Rubio\u2019s opinion on matters in the region. When the pandemic hit, it was Rubio and Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin\u00a0of Maryland\u00a0who worked with the administration to swiftly build out the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program that gave small-business owners around the country a way to finance payroll and other expenditures during Covid. \u201cIt was a really good experience working with him,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cWe had to get a result, and we had to do it quickly so we had to forgo any of the usual shadowboxing that\u2019s done around this place and reach decisions.\u201d Rubio also played a critical role in working closely with Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and helping design the child tax credit in the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax bill, threatening to initially vote against the package unless the refundability\u00a0of the credit in the bill was expanded, which eventually it was. \u2018Don\u2019t take the good ones\u2019:\u00a0GOP colleagues see Rubio as good pick for Trump In the years between his presidential run and now, Rubio has spent less time building his public profile and more time investing in his relationships in the Senate. In conversations with nearly a dozen lawmakers, many observe Rubio has matured as a legislator and spent most of the last eight years keeping his head down, focused on his role on the Senate Intelligence Committee and being a resource to members. \u201cI think we look to him for good, solid advice,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. \u201cI think when he moved from the failed effort \u2026 to run for\u00a0president and then back into the Senate, I did see a change. He seemed more focused on some of the policy initiatives he was working on . \u2026 Was that because there was just more time in the Senate or was that because running for\u00a0president can be a bit humbling? It can put anyone down a peg or two.\u201d Members also say they appreciate Rubio\u2019s personal and stylish delivery in dry party lunches when he does speak up, which they say would be an asset if he were selected to be Trump\u2019s VP. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of like a steady horse. He\u2019s not going to speak unless he needs to speak. He\u2019s not one of those flamboyant people who\u2019s gonna try to stand out and be the face of every topic. He stays in his lane,\u201d Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said. Asked whether Rubio has the experience to be the VP, Tuberville nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s the right age. That is the perfect age. He\u2019s been hardened, he\u2019s been called names by Trump himself, so I would not have any qualms,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI would hate to lose him in the Senate, but again we\u2019ve gotta do what\u2019s best in the next four years and the eight after that.\u201d Tuberville said he has joked with Trump \u201cdon\u2019t\u00a0take the good ones\u201d from the Senate, but he argues he\u2019s resigned himself to the fact that Rubio might be needed in the Trump administration more than in the chamber. Others see Rubio\u2019s personal story as an added advantage at a time when the GOP has made some inroads with Latino voters in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona. \u201cObviously, he is Cuban American, and Hispanics are increasingly coming to vote for Republicans. He speaks Spanish. He demonstrates a broader appeal than just a traditional Republican audience,\u201d\u00a0said GOP\u00a0Sen. John Cornyn\u00a0of Texas. Trump has done little to tip his hand in the veepstakes. Rubio is seen as the preferred pick among many donors,\u00a0and two of Trump\u2019s trusted confidants \u2013 Kellyanne Conway and Sean Hannity\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see him as a strong pick for Trump. But while some have gone out of their way to flaunt their allegiance to Trump, Rubio has taken a more nuanced approach, not appearing with Trump at the courthouse in Manhattan with others such as\u00a0Sen.\u00a0J.D. Vance\u00a0of Ohio, another VP contender. Rubio did, however,\u00a0vote against a massive aid package for Ukraine in April, arguing it didn\u2019t do anything to address the US\u2019 own border. Rubio has also been more reluctant to say whether he will support the results of the election this cycle, telling NBC In an interview last month,\u00a0\u201cI think you are asking the wrong person. The Democrats are the ones that have opposed every Republican victory since 2000.\u201d Rubio\u00a0\u2013\u00a0along with other senators\u00a0\u2013\u00a0has also been helping Trump\u00a0prep for the debate on Thursday and will be a surrogate for Trump in the spin room afterward. Rubio does face a potential hurdle as Trump weighs his options. Trump and Rubio both live in Florida, and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state, the Constitution dictates that state electors must vote for a president and vice president \u201cone of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\u201d Meaning, Florida\u2019s 30 Electoral College votes couldn\u2019t go to two Floridians. In a close election, that could prevent either Trump or Rubio (presumably the latter) from reaching 270 electoral college votes to assume their office. Rubio is open to moving if Trump selects him, and his residency is not a major concern among the former president\u2019s advisers at the moment, a person with knowledge of both sides\u2019 thinking told CNN. And while Rubio\u2019s ascension to vice president could mean a vacant Senate seat, he says he\u2019s not worried it could be lost to a Democrat. \u201cI would certainly feel a lot better about Florida today as a Republican than I would have a decade ago,\u201d he quipped.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/marco-rubio-trump-vp-pick-hopeful/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_trump-mar-a-lago-search-warrant", "text": "Federal Judge Aileen Cannon said Tuesday she had \u201ca hard time seeing\u201d any problems with the warrant the FBI obtained to search former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in the summer of 2022. While she didn\u2019t rule from the bench on the third and final day of oral arguments in Fort Pierce, Florida, Cannon appeared to side with prosecutors over whether Trump\u2019s defense can suppress boxes of evidence seized by the FBI in August 2022. Trump\u2019s attorney Emil Bove had argued that the warrant was overly broad and unjustly allowed agents to search the entire Mar-a-Lago premises. Cannon, however, said the language in the warrant, which a magistrate judge signed off on, seems to have been sufficient. \u201cI have a hard time seeing what more needed to be included\u201d in the warrant\u2019s description of where agents could search in Mar-a-Lago and what physical documents they could seize, Cannon said. Trump and his co-defendants, personal aide Walt Nauta and\u00a0Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, are facing charges of mishandling sensitive or classified materials and of obstruction in the case brought by special counsel Jack Smith.\u00a0All three have pleaded\u00a0not guilty. Bove, like in other recent hearings in the classified documents case, wants the judge to hold even more hearings that could probe into the investigators\u2019 work. But Cannon has had tough questions. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the search of a single-family home in the suburbs,\u201d Bove said, explaining that the 50-plus-room property wasn\u2019t approached specifically enough by the investigators when they told a court in 2022 they wanted permission to search for and seize classified documents. \u201cThey purported to look for classified documents in a gym and a kitchen,\u201d he added. But Cannon challenged Bove\u2019s complaints by pointing out there may not be legal issues with agents searching much of the property and finding documents in some rooms but not others. \u201cYou would agree that paperwork, though, could be located anywhere,\u201d the judge said. Investigators say they found classified documents in various places at the resort, including a public ballroom, a bathroom and a bedroom. Another tense moment At the conclusion of the hearing, Cannon and prosecutor David Harbach sparred again \u2013 after terse exchanges between the two on Monday \u2013 illuminating continued frustration from the special counsel\u2019s office with the hearings and the approach of Trump\u2019s lawyers. Harbach jumped up after Bove concluded his arguments. Trump\u2019s attorney had tried to claim, without much evidence in court, that prosecutors should have to provide information about any divisions within the FBI\u00a0regarding\u00a0the case\u00a0or whether any agents involved in the case disliked Trump. Harbach called this an \u201cattempt to hijack the hearing.\u201d But Cannon, who was already trying to wrap up the almost two-hour hearing, was quick to cut off the prosecutor. She told him the hearing hadn\u2019t been hijacked. Harbach asked the judge whether he could speak more in open court about the defense strategy. \u201cIt concerns the defense\u2019s repeated attempts to impart allegations that have nothing to do with what\u2019s before the court,\u201d he said. Cannon then cut him off, ending the hearing.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_julian-assange-plea-deal-biden-administration", "text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge related to his alleged role in one of the largest US government breaches of classified material, as part of a deal with the Justice Department that will allow him to avoid imprisonment in the United States, according to\u00a0newly filed federal\u00a0court documents. Under the terms of the new agreement, Justice Department prosecutors will seek a 62-month sentence \u2013 which is equal to the amount of time Assange has served in a high-security prison in London while he fought extradition to the US.\u00a0The plea deal\u00a0would\u00a0credit that time served, allowing Assange to immediately return to Australia, his native country. The plea deal must still be approved by a federal judge, but as of Monday morning, Assange had been released from a UK prison, according to WikiLeaks. \u201cJulian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1901 days there. He was granted bail by the High Court in London and was released at Stansted airport during the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK,\u201d WikiLeaks said a Tuesday\u00a0statement. A video uploaded by the group showed a black van traveling on a motorway followed by footage of Assange boarding a plane. A federal judge in the Northern Mariana Islands set a plea hearing and sentencing for Wednesday morning, according to the US District Court there. Justice Department prosecutors had asked the court for the proceedings to take place on the same day because Assange was resistant to setting foot in the continental US for his guilty plea, according to a letter from prosecutors. The court on the islands is near Australia, where Assange is a citizen and is expected to return to after the court hearing, prosecutors said. Prosecutors told the judge they \u201canticipate that the defendant will plead guilty to the charge \u2026 and be sentenced by the Court for that offense.\u201d Assange\u00a0was being pursued by US authorities for publishing confidential military records supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and 2011. He faced 18 counts from a 2019 indictment for his alleged role in the breach that carried a max of up to 175 years in prison, though he was unlikely to be sentenced to that time in full. US officials alleged that Assange goaded Manning into obtaining thousands of pages of\u202funfiltered US diplomatic cables\u202fthat potentially endangered confidential sources, Iraq war-related significant activity reports and information related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. President Joe Biden in recent months has alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials to return Assange to Australia, though a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN Tuesday that the White House was not involved in the plea deal. \u201cThis was an independent decision made by the Department of Justice and there was no White House involvement,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. FBI and Justice Department officials have opposed any deal that didn\u2019t include a felony guilty plea by Assange, people briefed on the matter told CNN. Last month, a UK court ruled that Assange had the right to appeal his final challenge against extradition to the US, dealing a win to him in his years-long fight to avoid prosecution in the States for his alleged crimes.

Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-elections-what-matters", "text": "With Democrats divided over the Israel-Hamas war, uninspired by their presidential nominee in Joe Biden and planning a convention in Chicago, there have been multiple comparisons to 1968, when Democrat Hubert Humphrey lost the White House to Republican Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War divided Democrats that year. Humphrey was uninspiring to younger voters opposed to the war. There was violence outside their convention in Chicago. Democrats today should hope that a better comparison is to 1948, when then-President Harry Truman, an unpopular incumbent, pulled off a surprise reelection versus Thomas Dewey, then the Republican governor of New York. That year, 1948, was also a much better year for Humphrey, then the young and inspiring Minneapolis mayor who helped push Democrats on the road to embracing civil rights legislation that would ultimately remake both political parties over the coming decades. I talked to Samuel Freedman, a Columbia Journalism School professor, about his recent book about Humphrey and the 1948 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. The book\u2019s title, \u201cInto the Bright Sunshine,\u201d is taken from a line in Humphrey\u2019s rousing speech on civil rights. The crackling audio does not hide the competing jeers and applause when Humphrey says: My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on states\u2019 rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states\u2019 rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. It is a particularly important time to remember right now, when there is an effort on the American political right to reinterpret the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Here\u2019s my conversation with Freedman, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity: Lessons for 2024 Biden from 1948 Truman WOLF: The fulcrum of the book is this 1948 Democratic convention and Humphrey\u2019s civil rights speech there. Until 2016, 1948 was probably the biggest presidential election upset in US history. What could 2024 Joe Biden, who trails Donald Trump in much of the polling, learn from 1948 Harry Truman, who trailed Thomas Dewey right to the end? FREEDMAN: They are very comparable experiences, even with the fact that Truman had not one third party, but two third parties also to worry about \u2013 Henry Wallace to his left and Strom Thurmond to his right. We don\u2019t know about the effect in the tight election of RFK Jr., and even for that matter, of (the Green Party\u2019s) Jill Stein. So Biden has a complicated course to run. Truman went back and forth on civil rights \u2013 he was very bold, amazingly so in 1946 and \u201947, then he backed away out of fear it would cost him the election in \u201848. Really what Humphrey\u2019s triumph with the civil rights plank at the \u201848 convention did is it forced Truman to run as a civil rights candidate, which ended up being the reason he won the race. He really starts it in July, Truman, by desegregating the military and the federal workforce, and he culminates it the last weekend before Election Day, having a rally and giving a campaign speech in Harlem, which no major party presidential candidate had ever done. So I think part of the lesson of what Truman did, for Biden, is to try to be bold, to be assertive, to take some of the risks that need to be taken. Humphrey went from heroic to ridiculed WOLF: Today, we look at Hubert Humphrey as an also-ran of American politics. What were you trying to accomplish writing a book that leads up to this single speech at the \u201948 convention? FREEDMAN: I wanted to fill two gaps. I wanted to, first of all, fill a biographical gap about Humphrey, because if people know him at all today, it\u2019s from a largely disparaged and ridiculed latter part of his career supporting the Vietnam War as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s vice president, getting the presidential nomination in 1968 amid the police riot in Chicago, and then really fecklessly, almost pathetically, running as the establishment candidate against George McGovern for the Democratic nomination in 1972. And yet, there was this amazing chapter in his earlier life when he had been out there in a way few White Americans of the time were, really putting his entire career at risk to fight the fight for civil rights. People who felt betrayed by Humphrey in the \u201960s because he was no longer being a liberal hero forgot why they thought he was a liberal hero in the first place. And what he did in the 1948 convention is the epitome of it, to get the Democratic Party to endorse the civil rights agenda for the first time ever, and to accomplish something that FDR hadn\u2019t been willing to do, which was to defy and ultimately oust the Southern segregationist wing of the party. The other gap I wanted to fill was a historical gap, because a lot of the great writing that\u2019s been done about the Civil Rights Movement tends to position its origins in the 1950s with the Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Ed decision, and so forth. And yet, there was all this activity in the \u201940s, very much catalyzed by Black GIs and the Double V movement (victory in the war and victory over oppression at home). You know, very much affected by the global war against fascism, and that activity really anticipates and makes possible everything that happens in the \u201950s and \u201860s, and yet has gotten much less attention, comparatively speaking. So those were the two gaps I was aiming to address. 2024 vs. 1968 WOLF: Humphrey is certainly more associated with that \u201968 convention. This year, there\u2019s obviously a fractured Democratic Party, as there was in 1968, and the convention is again in Chicago. What are the similarities you see between this year and \u201868? FREEDMAN:  There are a couple of takeaways from Humphrey\u2019s campaign in \u201968. One is you\u2019ve got to really hit the right tone. The speech that he made in April of 1968 to announce his campaign was so tone-deaf. It talked about the politics of happiness, the politics of joy, and it was completely out of tune with the tenor of the times. This is like three and a half weeks after Martin Luther King had been killed. It\u2019s just about as long as after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There was a massive anti-war movement. It just felt like Humphrey, who usually had such a keen sense of retail politics, totally misread the mood of the country. He struggled, really for the rest of the campaign, to come back to finding a way to stick to things he wanted to stick to about hope and unity and possibility, while trying to find the words, and I think never really quite succeeding, to acknowledge the hurt, the anxiety, the division within the country. It\u2019s also a lesson about the importance of optics, and this is even before the 24-hour news cycle. Humphrey is giving his speech at the \u201968 convention, where in the middle of his speech, the live TV coverage cuts away to show the Chicago police beating demonstrators and journalists on the streets of Chicago. It\u2019s the most catastrophic optic you could imagine. Another similarity is that although Joe Biden has run essentially unopposed in primaries, it\u2019s almost as if he didn\u2019t really have to face the Democratic voting public this year, the way he definitely did in 2020, and comes in as feeling more coordinated and less chosen. In 1968, the Democratic Party was operating under old rules in which primary voters actually had relatively little direct effect on delegates. Humphrey enters late, after Bobby Kennedy had been in, after Eugene McCarthy had been in, and won most of his delegates by going through the party apparatus. So it looked like he had this nomination kind of handed to him by the machine, over and against the passions of the voters, who had turned out in large numbers for Bobby Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. That also presents a problem of how do you build up the requisite passion? At the end of the day, he did something in late September that almost saved his campaign, which was finally to break away from Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and to stake out a much bolder peace plank on Vietnam. In fact, it was a peace plank that was defeated at the convention where Humphrey\u2019s forces opposed it. Had Humphrey done that sooner would he have won? Good question. The other important thing Humphrey said, that I think Biden really has to find a way to express, came from the speech accepting the nomination. I\u2019m going to read you this paragraph, because I think it\u2019s so prescient. He says: I say to those who\u2019ve differed with their neighbor or with those who\u2019ve differed with their fellow Democrat, may I say to you that all of your goals, all of your high hopes, all of your dreams, all them will come to naught if we lose this election, and many of them can be realized with the victory that can come to us. That is so exactly right, and it\u2019s something that Joe Biden has to communicate. Just like for people, particularly young liberals, who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humphrey in \u201968, what they got was Nixon. What they got was, instead of peace talks and a bombing halt, and an internationally supervised ceasefire, which was Humphrey\u2019s stance by the end of the campaign, they got the war going on for seven more years, with tens of thousands more American deaths and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Vietnamese deaths. They got Watergate. They got the race-baiting that Nixon engaged in. They got the proto-Trump pseudo populism of Spiro Agnew as vice president. So there\u2019s a real price to pay there for hanging on to your purity of not being able to vote for Hubert Humphrey and forgive him even the egregious mistake on Vietnam because of everything else he brought to the table that was absolutely consistent with the liberal agenda. Correcting the counterfactual about Republicans and civil rights WOLF: As I was reading the climax of this book, there was an interview on CNN with Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican from Florida, who was arguing this counterfactual \u2013 and you can find many other instances of it \u2013 that a lot of present-day Republicans are pushing that they deserve credit for the Civil Rights Movement, because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, because there were Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act. This comes up in your descriptions of the \u201948 convention, particularly with Strom Thurmond (the South Carolina Democrat turned Republican). I was hoping to get your historical analysis of that idea. FREEDMAN: It\u2019s preposterous for the Republicans to make that argument in 2024 or at any time in the last 60 years, to be honest. When Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948, that\u2019s the beginning of the vast majority of the White South becoming Republicans, stepping away from the Democratic Party. Even though (Adlai) Stevenson in \u201952 and \u201856 and JFK in 1960 tried to lure them back in, it was still the beginning of a process by which \u2013 with Barry Goldwater in \u201964, who opposed civil rights legislation; Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in \u201868 and \u201872; (Ronald) Reagan\u2019s appeals to racial resentment in \u201880 and \u201884; the Willie Horton ad in \u201888; and then to Trump in all of his races \u2013 that all began in \u201848. Those people who walked out with Strom Thurmond and the voters who voted for them never really went back to the Democratic Party again. While the party labels have remained the same \u2013 there is still the Democratic Party and there is still the Republican Party \u2013 the people who are voting have totally exchanged places, because the parties exchanged places on the issue of civil rights. It\u2019s true that, going back to Lincoln, the Republicans were seen as the party of emancipation and the amendments that created, at least on paper, racial equality. On that basis, until 1948 really with Truman, and then in even larger numbers in 1964 with LBJ and consistently since then, the White Southern vote that used to go to the Democrats, because the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow, has become the solid White vote for the Republican Party. Show me a major Republican politician in the MAGA movement who is a fervent supporter of civil rights legislation. In any kind of iteration, you don\u2019t have (Republicans) now like Mitt Romney\u2019s father, (former Michigan Gov.) George Romney, or (former Pennsylvania Gov.) William Scranton, or Edward Brooke, a Black senator from Massachusetts \u2026 You don\u2019t even have people like Nixon, before he went bad on civil rights, who was a really active member of the NAACP. That doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican Party anymore, and it\u2019s just absurd to say that because 80 years ago to 100, 120 years ago, the Democrats were indeed the party of segregation, that that\u2019s somehow still the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-elections-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The order was issued by Chief Judge Anna Elizabeth Blackburne-Rigsby of the DC Court of Appeals, which is the highest appellate court in DC and oversees the DC Bar.\u00a0Her order said the felony convictions appear to be the types of \u201cserious crimes\u201d under the DC Bar rules that govern such immediate orders of suspension. The judge also instructed the DC Bar\u2019s Board of Professional Responsibility to hold additional proceedings, as laid out in the bar\u2019s rules. It is typical for bars in other states to reciprocate law license suspension or disbarment orders, meaning Biden\u2019s license is also likely to soon be suspended in any other state where he is licensed. A jury in Wilmington, Delaware, found the president\u2019s son guilty earlier this month of unlawfully possessing a gun in 2018 while using drugs and of making false statements related to his drug use when purchasing the firearm. The case, which was brought by special counsel David Weiss, was the first of two trials Biden is facing. Later this year, a tax case that Weiss brought against Biden will go to trial in Los Angeles. Biden has asked for a new trial in the gun case. His lawyers have also made challenges to the prosecution, including arguing that the case violated the Second Amendment. Those appeals have been unsuccessful. Biden has not worked as an attorney in recent years and instead has tried to earn income by\u00a0releasing a memoir\u00a0in 2021 and through his fledgling\u00a0art career. He worked at the high-profile law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner from 2009 to 2017, according to court filings in his criminal case. He also represented Hong Kong-based businessman\u00a0Patrick Ho\u00a0while he was the target of a Justice Department foreign corruption probe. (Ho was later charged and convicted of bribery and money laundering.) Biden was indirectly paid $1 million to represent Ho, according to his\u00a0tax indictment\u00a0and a\u00a0Senate GOP report. During\u00a0closing arguments\u00a0in Biden\u2019s gun trial, one of the prosecutors described him as a \u201cYale-educated defendant,\u201d referring to the school where he earned his law degree. They brought this up to argue that, as a lawyer, Biden should have understood the legalese on the federal firearm forms he filled out when he purchased a revolver in 2018.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/hunter-biden-law-license-suspended/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_28_politics_state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg", "text": "This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion \u2013 and a few aimed at restricting it. Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years. Abortion measures on the ballot in November Five states \u2014\u00a0Colorado, Florida, Maryland, New York and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state\u2019s 15-week ban on May 1. After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June. States with potential abortion ballot measures Organizers in other states across the country are working to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline this summer, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which are fundraising to secure the money to support the campaigns. Arizona, Nevada and Montana have all seen proposed measures protecting abortion access up to the point of viability, which doctors say is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. A potential measure in Arkansas would allow abortion up to 20 weeks into pregnancy or in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. A potential measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0could still make the ballot in November.\u00a0An opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion,\u00a0however,\u00a0never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session. A number of potential measures, like those in Nevada and Montana, allow for abortion past the point of viability when deemed necessary by a doctor to protect a pregnant person\u2019s life or health \u2014 though doctors and lawmakers have struggled to define exactly what type of medical emergencies would be allowed under the exception. A proposed measure to restrict abortion access in Pennsylvania seeks to establish that public funding can\u2019t be used for the procedure, though it is unlikely to pass the state legislature. States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed. While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The pardon proclamation is expected to be announced on Wednesday and one official said it is set to affect roughly 2,000 people. The granting of pardons won\u2019t automatically change convicted veterans\u2019 records but allows those impacted to apply for a certificate of pardon that will help them receive withheld benefits. The pardon, which CNN is first to report on, specifically grants clemency to service members who were convicted under former Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 125 \u2014\u202fwhich criminalized sodomy, including between consenting adults\u00a0\u2014\u202fbetween\u00a01951 and 2013 when it was rewritten by Congress. It also applies to those who were convicted of attempting to commit those offenses. Anyone who was convicted of a non-consensual act such as rape will not be pardoned. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Separately, the law known as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was repealed by Congress in 2011, but not before thousands of service members had been discharged from the military. A service member\u2019s discharge status can determine what kind of Veterans Affairs benefits they are eligible for. A bad-conduct discharge, for example, given under general court-martial, can make someone\u202fineligible\u202ffor services including a VA home loan military pension,\u00a0and education benefits. The pardon is separate from the Pentagon\u2019s ongoing review of military records for those who were discharged based on their sexual orientation, which one of the officials said did not apply to convictions under the UCMJ. The Pentagon launched a new outreach campaign last September to reach more veterans who believe they \u201csuffered an error or injustice\u201d to have their military records reviewed. \u201cFor decades, our LGBTQ+ service members were forced to hide or were prevented from serving altogether,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the time. \u201cEven still, they selflessly put themselves in harm\u2019s way for the good of our country and the American people.\u201d In order to get their records changed under the pardon, individuals will need to complete an online application, which will go to their military service department. The services will then review the individual\u2019s court-martial and service record and determine if they are eligible for the pardon; that determination will then be sent to the attorney general,\u00a0acting through the Department of Justice\u2019s pardon attorney, a US official explained. The certificate of pardon does not automatically change someone\u2019s discharge status. If a certificate of pardon is issued, the service member will then have to apply to their respective military department\u2019s board of corrections to have their military records corrected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-expected-pardon-veterans-convicted-gay-sex-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The\u00a0lawsuit,\u00a0filed Monday in federal\u00a0court, contends that the legislation\u00a0violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. House Bill 71, signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry last week, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \u201clarge, easily readable font\u201d be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools. It is currently the only state with the requirement. In the complaint, the plaintiffs argue that mandating the Ten Commandments be posted in every classroom renders them \u201cunavoidable\u201d and \u201cunconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state\u2019s favored religious scripture.\u201d \u201cIt also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments\u2014or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display\u2014do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state\u2019s religious preferences,\u201d the complaint continues. The lawsuit is being brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation,\u00a0on behalf of nine \u201cmulti-faith families\u201d with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools. The families involved in the lawsuit include parents who are \u201cJewish, Christian, Unitarian Universalist, and non-religious,\u201d according to the joint news release\u00a0announcing the lawsuit. \u201cThis law strikes at the core of religious freedom,\u201d Alanah Odoms, executive director of ACLU Louisiana, said in an online news conference Monday, calling HB 71 the \u201ccanary in the coal mine.\u201d The lawsuit names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards. In a statement provided to CNN on Monday evening, Brumley said he looked forward to implementing the law. \u201cThe Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana\u2019s state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana\u2019s sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America\u2019s foundation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Landry for comment. Several of the parents being represented spoke at the news conference about why they chose to sue over the new law. Josh Herlands, a Jewish father participating in the lawsuit, called the legislation \u201cunconstitutional, divisive, intolerant, and frankly un-American.\u201d Rev. Darcy Roake, a Unitarian Universalist minister, said that she and her Jewish husband are teaching their children the \u201cvalues of religious inclusion and diversity,\u201d and that the law \u201cwill create an unwelcoming and oppressive school environment for children like ours.\u201d Presbyterian Rev. Jeff Sims said he believes it is a \u201cgross intrusion of civil authority into matters of faith.\u201d Louisiana state Rep. Dodie Horton, the Republican author of the legislation, has previously dismissed concerns from opponents of the measure, saying the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \u201cmoral code\u201d in the classroom. The organizations told journalists on Monday they\u00a0plan\u00a0to work toward obtaining a preliminary injunction hearing this summer, \u201cso this law can never be implemented for the children in Louisiana.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/louisiana-parents-sue-ten-commandments-schools/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Merchan was not removed from the case, but has another case that conflicts with Bannon\u2019s trial, according to the office of court administration. The administrative judge\u00a0for the\u00a0New York County Supreme Court Criminal Term notified the parties in an email Friday saying the reassignment\u00a0will \u201cbest serve the needs of the Court.\u201d \u201cThe Honorable Juan M.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_takeaways-trump-classified-documents-special-counsel-gag-order", "text": "During a long day of hearings in Fort Pierce, Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon challenged prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team to show how former President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated comments about the FBI translated into a threat against law enforcement officers. The special counsel\u2019s office says that a gag order is needed because Trump has repeatedly, and misleadingly, alleged that the agents who searched his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 were authorized to murder him. Cannon did not seem inclined to approve the limitations on Trump\u2019s speech but did not immediately issue a ruling. The judge also heard arguments on Trump\u2019s long-shot motion alleging that the special counsel\u2019s office is being improperly funded. She did not rule on that motion either. Here\u2019s what to know from Monday\u2019s hearings: Cannon is skeptical of a gag order Cannon showed some skepticism toward prosecutors\u2019 arguments, asking where they saw a call to violence in Trump\u2019s comments and saying that they had needed to show some connecting facts between what the former president has said and the threats they are warning about. Cannon said that the statute prosecutors are citing for the gag order \u201cstill requires a finding\u201d related to the potential risks to others, noting that prosecutors don\u2019t need a direct cause. \u201cThere still needs to be a factual connection between A and B,\u201d Cannon said of the bridge between Trump\u2019s comments and potential threats. Prosecutor David Harbach responded that other posts and comments by Trump \u201cultimately result in all types of terrible things,\u201d including threats or harassment of law enforcement. He said that while Trump is welcome to campaign, there should be certain limits when it comes to the safety of FBI agents on the case. Judge dresses down prosecutor Cannon repeatedly sparred with Harbach, who she said was being snippy during his arguments. First, Cannon dressed down the prosecutor for his lack of \u201cdecorum\u201d while addressing her. Harbach had seemingly become irritated at Cannon\u2019s detailed questions. Cannon quickly stopped Harbach, telling him, \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate your tone.\u201d She added that she would \u201cappreciate decorum at all times\u201d and said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t able to do that, I\u2019m sure one of your colleagues can take up arguing this motion.\u201d \u201cYes, your honor,\u201d Harbach replied. The judge also slammed Harbach for not providing evidence\u00a0of other\u00a0court\u00a0rulings on gag orders against Trump, despite referring to those orders in their arguments. Harbach later apologized to Cannon, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be unprofessional. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d Trump accuses Smith of trying to punish him for others\u2019 actions Trump\u2019s defense attorney Todd Blanche said Monday that there were no threats to FBI agents in Trump\u2019s email or social media posts cited by the government, and argued the Justice Department was trying to punish Trump for other people\u2019s comments. \u201cThe attacks, very clearly, are against President Biden,\u201d Blanche said of Trump\u2019s communications at issue. Blanche acknowledged that the DOJ\u2019s \u201cdeadly force\u201d policy in place for the Mar-a-Lago search was standard for the execution of such search warrants but said that \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that it was right\u201d for agents to have been armed during the search (as they normally are). The defense attorney also said that prosecutors were trying to set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d by changing the former president\u2019s conditions of release. He said that prosecutors are too vaguely defining what a threat is, making any potential new rules difficult to follow and potentially making him liable for other peoples\u2019 comments. \u201cSteve Bannon making a comment is potentially the kind of thing that could send President Trump to jail,\u201d Blanche said. Cannon has tough questions on how special counsel\u2019s office is funded In the morning session, though the judge was careful to say her questions shouldn\u2019t imply she was leaning one way, Cannon pushed Justice Department attorney James Pearce to explain how much money the department has used for its work in the Trump criminal cases. The judge noted that even if the office discloses its spending publicly every six months, a financial disclosure\u00a0that would encompass last fall through this March was overdue. She also sought from prosecutors guidance on explaining the\u00a0laws and regulations that governed past special prosecutors, at one point bringing up Watergate and the era of Janet Reno as attorney general. Cannon\u2019s questions were so pointed toward Pearce that at one point the prosecutor mentioned how other courts have been overturned if they invalidated a government function in the way Cannon was probing, and said he hoped the Justice Department could provide additional written argument to the court if invalidating Smith was a serious possibility. Should Congress be more involved? Trump is also aiming to bring Congress into the conversation. Trump attorney Emil Bove advocated at Monday\u2019s hearing that Cannon should insist on more congressional oversight of the special counsel\u2019s office\u2019s work, or decide that the way the office is funded is unlawful because, he says, the money is being used in a way Congress hadn\u2019t authorized. The argument is in line with other arguments the Trump team has made to the judge in recent days alleging Smith is too independent from Justice Department leadership. Bove also told the judge more congressional oversight would curb what he called \u201cextraordinary things\u201d that were happening in the documents case.\u200b Justice Department attorneys have responded in court that the special counsel operates in line with established policies, in place over several decades and administrations, and that the DOJ is committed to continuing to fund this prosecution of Trump under the attorney general\u2019s authorization. Republicans on Capitol Hill have also tried to buckle down on the DOJ\u2019s use of the special counsel\u2019s office and its funding.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/takeaways-trump-classified-documents-special-counsel-gag-order/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_bob-good-virginia-primary-trump-gop", "text": "It\u2019s a primary election that took an MRI of the modern Republican Party \u2014 revealing toxic backstabbing, desperate lunges for Donald Trump\u2019s favor and the former president\u2019s always festering sense of betrayal. And no one knows how it will end. Rep. Bob Good \u2013 an arch conservative whom Trump is trying to bump out of Congress for disloyalty \u2013 trails his GOP challenger, state Sen. John McGuire, by just over 340 votes after Tuesday\u2019s election in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District, with about 96% of votes in. The fate of Trump\u2019s quest for revenge could ironically partly hang on mail-in ballots \u2013 a category of votes the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has often decried with his false claims of 2020 election fraud. Trump is angry at Good, the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, because he initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP presidential race. Kevin McCarthy also showed that Virginia is for vengeance by seeking his own bounty on Good, who helped to oust the California Republican as speaker last year. Good could become the first Republican incumbent to lose a House primary to a nonincumbent this year despite his frantic efforts to win back Trump\u2019s support, which included a trip to support the former president at his hush money trial in New York. McGuire told supporters Tuesday night, \u201cI\u2019m your Republican nominee,\u201d and thanked Trump for his help, even though the race could be heading for a recount if the margin between the two candidates remains so tight and the losing candidate requests one. Good said on social media that he\u2019d held off the \u201cWashington swamp\u201d and declared the race \u201ctoo close to call.\u201d CNN has not made a projection. Defeat for Good would strangle a fast-rising congressional career born when he won a drive-thru GOP convention in a Lynchburg church parking lot during the pandemic. The staunch conservative was elected to chair the powerful Freedom Caucus in only his second term. But he authored his own demise by getting crosswise with two key forces in the riotous Republican House majority \u2014 the ex-president and McCarthy, whose still potent financial machine is on a revenge tour. But the significance of the drama in this district \u2013 an area that produced presidents James Madison and James Monroe \u2013 goes far beyond a single, thwarted political arc. It shows that the real dividing line in the GOP is no longer a question of ideology. In more normal times, it would have been hard to imagine a conservative challenger getting to the right of Good. But in the modern GOP, the true acid test of political viability is total fealty to the presumptive nominee. And this race, which was the most expensive House GOP primary of the 2024 cycle so far, will also serve as the perfect emblem of a chaotic House majority that will be remembered far more for vicious internal fights and members trampling over one another to prove their devotion to Trump than for its legislative record. Trump\u2019s intervention The ex-president has plenty of weightier worries amid a staggering confluence of legal crises following his first criminal conviction and three other indictments and with a potential second presidency to plan. But he also has a sensitive political radar that picks out even the merest hint of disloyalty. It was therefore not surprising that Trump conducted a tele-rally for McGuire on primary eve and left his supporters with no doubt about who he favored and why. \u201cIf he\u2019s reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. He was against things that everybody would have wanted and always made it difficult,\u201d Trump told supporters on the call. \u201cHe just let us down, he let us down very big. \u2026 As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years and then after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that\u2019s not good enough, because those are the people that \u2013 they tend to leave you very quickly.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to drive Good out of Congress sprung from the same reflex to exert power that he showed last week. In his first visit to Capitol Hill since his mob beat up police officers and smashed their way into the House and Senate on January 6, 2021, the ex-president gathered Republican lawmakers around him in a show of homage. The image of the day was a handshake offered by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hasn\u2019t hidden his disdain for the former president but who has never shirked from what needs to be done for the GOP to win and retain power. While he was estranged from Trump, Good campaigned as though he and the former president were on the same side. He used signs that said: \u201cTrump, Bob Good: Keeping America Great\u201d \u2013 as he appeared alongside the former president\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, himself a former Freedom Caucus chairman. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju in March, Good dismissed questions about his backing of DeSantis, whose primary bid ended in January after a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.\u00a0\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get with the present? This is a time to rally behind President Trump,\u201d Good said. \u201cMy opponent wants to continue to divide people based on the past. We\u2019re all behind President Trump. He must win. The country can\u2019t handle four more years of Joe Biden.\u201d The passport to power in Trump\u2019s GOP McGuire displayed the behavior required of anyone who wants a future in the Trump-era GOP in an interview with \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday just before polls opened in Virginia. He attacked Good for not being loyal to the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. \u201cObviously, he bagged Trump for an endorsement in 2022. And less than a year later, when the chips were down \u2026 he endorsed a different candidate.\u201d The retired Navy SEAL also upheld the former president\u2019s claims of election fraud in 2020 by arguing that Trump was doomed by changes to voting arrangements that were introduced during the Covid-19 emergency. \u201cI would say changing the rules in the middle of the game is cheating. And I think that that Trump was robbed,\u201d McGuire said. A new law allowing no-excuse absentee voting was passed by Virginia\u2019s legislature and approved by the governor in April 2020, seven months before the election. McGuire also voiced Trump\u2019s claims that the former president is a victim of a weaponized justice system following his conviction for falsifying business records to hide a payment to a former adult film star in 2016. Trump has made similar claims about his indictments over his attempt to overturn the election in 2020 and for alleged mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but I think all Americans, we go back to trust. You know, if we don\u2019t have trust in our institutions, our country is going to fall apart. And there is evidence everywhere of a two-tiered justice system. Rules for thee, not for me,\u201d McGuire said. The candidate\u2019s willingness to submit to the modern GOP\u2019s trifecta \u2014 unflinching loyalty to Trump and acceptance of his election fraud conspiracies and legal persecution narrative could yet see him emerge as the district\u2019s GOP nominee. Good could only manage two of the three \u2014 and it could cost him his career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/bob-good-virginia-primary-trump-gop/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_presidential-debate-history-what-matters", "text": "CNN\u2019s presidential debate will feel like something new for most Americans, but it is actually a return to the roots of presidential debates. Rather than a forum sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which had organized all general election presidential debates since 1988, the meeting Thursday between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be hosted by CNN but simulcast on some other networks. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the meeting at CNN\u2019s Atlanta studio and, unlike commission debates, there will be no live audience. That TV studio format is not unlike the first televised presidential debates in 1960 between then-Sen. John F. Kennedy and then-Vice President Richard Nixon. There was a series of four televised debates in September and October of 1960, all of which occurred in TV studios, although one featured Nixon in a Los Angeles studio and Kennedy in New York, according to a history maintained by the commission. Those first debates were the brain child of network TV executives, according to Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University and author of \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail.\u201d Kennedy is generally viewed as the winner of the 1960 debates, in part because of his comfort on camera. Nixon, meanwhile, did not wear makeup, did not practice the debate format and did not look like himself after a stay in the hospital due to a knee injury, Schroeder told me in a phone conversation. Nixon learned his lesson, and there were no debates for his subsequent White House runs in 1968 and 1972. The next presidential debates did not take place until 1976, when Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, was in a similar position to Biden today. According to Schroeder, \u201che was looking for something dramatic to break the logjam\u201d of poor polling for the Republican after taking over the presidency following Nixon\u2019s Watergate-related resignation. During his speech to the Republican National Convention that year, Ford issued a challenge to Jimmy Carter to debate. But the gamble backfired when Ford flubbed an answer related to the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe. Carter was able to appear qualified and capable in front of a massive audience. That\u2019s a very different dynamic from today, when Americans have already experienced both a Biden and a Trump presidency. Four years later, Carter was less excited to debate. He skipped a forum featuring the Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, and an independent candidate, John Anderson, and took part in only one debate with Reagan. Ultimately, the commission was formed to create a nonpartisan framework for presidential debates \u2013 something that has been exported to other countries. Schroeder said that while he preferred the old system of debates organized by the commission, it would make sense for campaigns to want to have more control over the process. The TV studio format will allow Biden to sidestep \u201cthe distraction of boisterous Trump supporters interrupting, carrying on with loud applause or laughing, all those things that that happen when you have a live audience, and particularly a very politicized live audience,\u201d Schroeder said. Another model for debates, from the pre-Civil War era, relied on massive live audiences and featured Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. But the so-called Lincoln-Douglas debates did not take place during the 1860 presidential election, when the two were both candidates and when Lincoln won the White House. Instead, the debates occurred in 1858, and focused on the issue of slavery when the two men were running for Senate in Illinois. Douglas kept the Illinois Senate seat, but the debates gave Lincoln a national profile and helped him on the way to the White House. Don\u2019t expect a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate on TV. While more than 10,000 people attended most of the debates, held in locations across Illinois, they would seem extremely long-winded for someone with a 21st century attention span. The first speaker would get a 60-minute opening statement. The second got a 90-minute response. And the first speaker got a final 30-minute rebuttal. CNN\u2019s entire debate will last 90 minutes and include two commercial breaks. It will not feature opening statements, although each candidate will get a closing statement. After a coin toss, Biden is set to give the first closing statement and Trump will go last. Read more about the debate setup. The debate will be watched live by millions on CNN and other TV networks, but unlike the Kennedy-Nixon debates, it will continue to be digested by potential voters in video clips on social media after it airs. For the large portion of Americans who already know how they\u2019ll vote, it\u2019s unlikely a debate performance will change their minds, but Schroeder argued there are people who haven\u2019t expressed a preference. \u201cThey\u2019re still up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis debate and the one (hosted by ABC News) in September are likely to be events that would attract the people who don\u2019t normally pay a lot of attention to politics.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/presidential-debate-history-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_julian-assange-decadelong-pursuit-inside-plea-deal", "text": "The United States\u2019 pursuit of Julian Assange for leaking state secrets has played out for more than a decade in courtrooms and government offices across the world, from Washington, DC, to London to Stockholm and Quito, Ecuador. But on Wednesday it came to a sudden, somewhat uneasy end, when the Wikileaks founder pleaded guilty in a US federal court to a single felony charge related to his alleged role in orchestrating one of the largest-ever breaches of US classified military and diplomatic documents. The plea deal allows Assange to avoid prison in the US and return to his native Australia. Discussions between Assange\u2019s legal team and US prosecutors ebbed and flowed across three US presidencies during his yearslong battle to avoid extradition to the US where he faced a trial on 18 felony counts. Australian diplomats brought up the plight of Assange every chance they got during the past three years of the Biden administration, a stark contrast to their behavior during the Trump years, when they largely avoided the matter due to concerns it could harm the broader bilateral relationship between the two countries, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. \u201cThat never came up in our conversations,\u201d said David Stilwell, the State Department assistant secretary for the Pacific region during the Trump administration. \u201cNot a word.\u201d But in recent months, talks heated up, in part thanks to the efforts of a left-leaning Australian government that came to power two years ago, giving Assange a powerful ally as he waged a protracted legal battle from a London prison. Recent rulings in UK courts favoring Assange in his extradition fight also provided key gains in the saga. At a meeting in the Oval Office as part of an official state visit at the end of October, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese raised the issue of Assange with President Joe Biden, suggesting that enough time had passed and that the case needed to be resolved. Biden and his team responded positively but made clear they would not interfere with the Justice Department, according to people familiar with the matter. As recently as April, Assange\u2019s attorneys and DOJ prosecutors held discussions about a potential deal. Assange insisted that he would agree to plead guilty only to misdemeanor charges related to his dissemination of US classified documents, people briefed on the talks told CNN. That same month, Australian officials also wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland suggesting the outlines of a potential deal, including having Assange plead guilty and being allowed to return to Australia, but also leaving open the potential of a felony plea, according to a person briefed on the matter. Biden told reporters at the time that he was considering a request made by the Australia parliament in February for the Justice Department to drop the 18 felony charges brought against him in 2019. Inside the Biden administration, there was opposition from the FBI and some DOJ officials to any deal that didn\u2019t include felony charges, people briefed on the matter said. Some officials also pushed for Assange to be brought to federal court in northern Virginia and face at least some US prison time. Assange spent the last five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison fighting off extradition. He left the facility on Monday to travel to the Northern Mariana Islands for his plea hearing and sentencing before a federal judge there. US prosecutors had asked the court for the proceedings to take place on the same day because Assange was resistant to setting foot in the continental US for his guilty plea, according to a letter from prosecutors. A May ruling by London\u2019s High Court that Assange could continue appealing his extradition appeared to change the trajectory of the negotiations, prompting the US Justice Department and Assange\u2019s lawyers to renew their discussions over a plea deal. For US prosecutors, the fact that Assange had already served five years at Belmarsh fighting extradition, and the likelihood that a guilty plea for similar crimes would result in a comparable sentence within the US, added to efforts to try to seal an agreement. The White House said on Tuesday that it wasn\u2019t involved in the decision. But Biden\u2019s comments in April suggest they weren\u2019t putting up any resistance. Assange and Wikileaks rose to international prominence after the site released massive troves of classified materials from the Pentagon and State Department that were supplied to Assange by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange allegedly goaded Manning into obtaining thousands of pages of\u00a0unfiltered US diplomatic cables\u00a0that potentially endangered confidential sources, Iraq war-related significant activity reports and information related to Guantanamo Bay detainees. Manning served about seven years in prison for her role in the massive leak. Before leaving office, then-President Barack Obama commuted her sentence. A yearslong legal battle Assange\u2019s hearing on Wednesday concludes what has been a yearslong legal battle that stretched across the past three US presidential administrations. The Obama administration believed that criminal charges against Assange posed potential First Amendment concerns because of the role major news organizations played in publishing some documents obtained by Wikileaks. But the Trump administration pursued the criminal case after taking a second look at the federal government\u2019s investigation, eventually charging Assange with 18 counts that carried a max of up to 175 years in prison, though he was unlikely to be sentenced to that time in full. When the charges\u00a0were made public in May 2019 the Australians felt that they were in a sweet spot in terms of relations with the Trump administration, according to a source familiar with the relations at the time. They were planning a state visit for September 2019 and highly cognizant of the fact that Trump often let issues bleed into one another instead of keeping them separate. As a result \u2013 despite some internal frustration \u2013 they were not willing to risk the working relationship over Assange. Justice Department prosecutors may have brought the case against Assange under Trump but not under Obama because Trump\u2019s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, prioritized investigating leaks of classified information, according to Adam Hickey, who served as a national security-focused official at the Justice Department under the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. Sessions\u2019 focus on national security-related leaks was \u201cprobably one of the reasons why the [Assange] case had more traction,\u201d Hickey told CNN. Hickey said he was not involved in the Assange case when he was a senior official at DOJ\u2019s National Security Division from 2016 to 2023. But the Assange case was always going to present challenges for prosecutors. His background was unusual compared to others the Justice Department has charged under the Espionage Act or other counterintelligence and national security laws. \u201cAssange is neither your traditional journalist nor is he a spy or a card-carrying foreign intelligence officer,\u201d said Hickey, who\u2019s now a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown. \u201cSo how that plays out in court would be interesting. [It] could be unpredictable.\u201d Most well-known groups supporting press freedoms, and some major news outlets, opposed the Assange indictment. Some have argued that the case imperiled journalists, even if Assange didn\u2019t operate under the same rules or ethics that guide newsrooms. The Committee to Protect Journalists, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations that advocate for the First Amendment recently raised these concerns while urging the Justice Department to drop the case altogether. \u201cThe prosecution of Assange in the United States would create legal pathways under the Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act that would allow for the prosecution of journalists who are simply doing their jobs and covering matters of public interest,\u201d the coalition wrote in a letter to Garland last month. Andrew McCabe, former FBI deputy director and a CNN contributor, called the indictment against Assange, \u201ctotally valid.\u201d But he also echoed Hickey\u2019s concern about the uncertainty of a potential trial, telling CNN that court proceedings could be \u201cdivisive\u201d and have a \u201cnegative impact on journalistic activities.\u201d \u201cThe guy deserved to be charged how he was charged but it\u2019s also the right thing to come to this resolution. Both decisions are legitimate,\u201d McCabe said. Stilwell, the former State Department official under the Trump administration, pushed back on the Assange plea deal. \u201cHe knew what he was doing when he did it, and instead of going through regular channels like the inspector general he did it is own way, he did it for himself,\u201d Stilwell said. \u201cThe number of sources and methods we lost because of Assange is unfathomable. Releasing him sets a precedent and is wrong. He should rot in prison or worse.\u201d Others have more nuanced views. Bradley Moss, a seasoned national security attorney based in Washington, DC, told CNN the Assange plea deal \u201cavoids the significant constitutional implications\u201d that would\u2019ve emerged at Assange\u2019s trial, which would\u2019ve happened at the federal court in northern Virginia, where the jury pool includes people in the defense and intelligence sectors. \u201cThere is no longer a concern that the presiding judge would have to determine the extent to which the First Amendment protects members of the media, who themselves do not hold security clearances, from criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act,\u201d Moss said, adding that past US administrations have \u201cavoided touching\u201d this third rail. He also said that after Assange\u2019s dozen years in de facto detention \u2013 seven years at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and then five years in British jails \u2013 in the eyes of federal prosecutors, \u201cthere is no more blood to be squeezed from this proverbial rock.\u201d CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen, Marshall Cohen and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/julian-assange-decadelong-pursuit-inside-plea-deal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_trump-gag-order", "text": "The judge in Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial has lifted portions of the gag order restricting what the former president can say about witnesses in the trial, such as Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, two days before Trump will square off against President Joe Biden at the CNN Presidential Debate. Trump, however, cannot discuss any prosecutor, court staffer or their family members,\u00a0according to a court order on Tuesday from Judge Juan Merchan that rolls back parts of the gag order imposed before the trial began.\u00a0That aspect of the gag order remains in effect at least until his sentencing, which is set for July 11. The new order Tuesday also lifts the bar on public statements about jurors but notes disclosure of any personally identifying information of any juror is still prohibited. Merchan wrote in his decision lifting parts of the gag order Tuesday that the \u201ccircumstances have now changed\u201d following Trump\u2019s conviction last month on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The judge\u2019s decision comes two days before Trump\u2019s debate with Biden, where Trump\u2019s conviction is sure to be raised. The former president will now be able to discuss the witnesses who testified against him as well as the makeup of the Democratic-leaning jury pool in Manhattan. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that Merchan\u2019s order \u201cleaves in place portions of the unconstitutional gag order\u201d and that Trump plans to appeal the ruling. \u201cThis is another unlawful decision by a highly conflicted judge, which is blatantly un-American as it gags President Trump, the leading candidate in the 2024 presidential election during the upcoming presidential debate on Thursday,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cPresident Trump and his legal team will immediately challenge today\u2019s unconstitutional order.\u201d Last week, New York\u2019s highest court declined to hear Trump\u2019s appeal on the gag order \u201cupon the ground that no substantial constitutional question is directly involved.\u201d Trump was held in contempt 10 times during the trial for violating Merchan\u2019s gag order after he made statements about Cohen and Daniels and complained about the jury pool. The judge fined Trump $10,000 \u2013 $1,000 for each violation \u2013 and threatened him with imprisonment if additional violations occurred. Trump repeatedly complained about the gag order throughout the seven-week trial, arguing that witnesses, including Cohen, were taking advantage of the gag order to attack him when he couldn\u2019t respond. During the trial, Merchan said he could not legally restrict Cohen\u2019s public statements but he expressed consternation over what the former Trump fixer and lawyer was saying about the case. At one point, Merchan told prosecutors to urge Cohen not to make public statements about the trial. In a statement to CNN, Cohen said Tuesday: \u201cFor the past six years, Donald and acolytes have been making constant negative statements about me. Donald\u2019s failed strategy of discrediting me so that he can avoid accountability didn\u2019t work then and won\u2019t work now.\u201d The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. In his order, Merchan wrote that his gag order provisions \u201cwere narrowly tailored to address the significant concerns regarding the Defendant\u2019s extrajudicial speech,\u201d while noting that appeals courts have upheld the restrictions he placed on Trump during the trial. The judge acknowledged that he was reluctant to lift the gag order pertaining to the jurors, writing, \u201cthere is ample evidence to justify continued concern for the jurors.\u201d Merchan wrote it was his \u201cstrong preference to extend those protections\u201d to jurors, but he said he could not legally do so. As for the remaining protections for prosecutors, court staffers and their families, Merchan says they must feel safe to do their jobs ahead of sentencing. \u201cUntil sentence is imposed,\u201d Merchan wrote, those covered by that part of his gag order \u201cmust continue to perform their lawful duties free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm.\u201d Last week, Manhattan prosecutors urged Merchan to keep in place the gag order preventing Trump from making statements about jurors, prosecutors and their family members, arguing threats against prosecutors have increased since the start of the trial. In the filing, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said it did not oppose lifting the portion of the gag order that blocked Trump from making statements about witnesses.

{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_bannon-trump-election-what-matters", "text": "Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist in the White House, used the language of war to fire up a conservative gathering over the weekend, promising to remake the US government and completely deconstruct the FBI. Comparing the presidential campaign to the D-Day invasion, Bannon encouraged a cheering crowd at the Turning Point Action convention in Detroit to see themselves as filling the positions of fallen soldiers in an assault. \u2018War to the knife\u2019 \u201cAre we at war?\u201d he asked the crowd. \u201cIs this a political war to the knife?\u201d I was not familiar with that term \u2013 \u201cwar to the knife\u201d \u2013 but Bannon also recently used it in an interview with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. A Google search yielded a 1998 book by that name about the Bleeding Kansas skirmishes in the years before the Civil War when pro- and anti-slavery settlers flooded into Kansas and feuded over whether Kansas should enter the union as a free or slave state. The book, according to its description, attributes the term to the Atchison Squatter Sovereign, which the Library of Congress describes as a pro-slavery newspaper of the era. It\u2019s not clear where Bannon got the term. \u201cAre you prepared to leave it all on the battlefield in 2024?\u201d he asked of Turning Point activists. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple: victory or death!\u201d he later added. The Trump campaign, which has spent large portions of fundraising on the former president\u2019s legal bills, has indicated it will rely on organizations like Turning Point Action to mobilize young activists, get out the vote in November and also to challenge votes of their opponents. Read more about the campaign\u2019s strategy from CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes and Alayna Treene. Previously pardoned, now facing prison The use of such violent imagery is important when considering it came from Bannon, a Trump true-believer who worked for a time in Trump\u2019s White House and has continued to try to influence Trump ever since. The stakes of the election must be extremely high from Bannon\u2019s perspective. Already pardoned by Trump for his role in a scheme to allegedly defraud donors of contributions intended to help build a border wall, Bannon was subsequently convicted by a jury in 2022 of the rarely prosecuted crime of contempt of Congress. Bannon refused to cooperate with subpoenas from the committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection when Democrats controlled Congress. After delays, Bannon must begin serving a four-month prison sentence starting next month. While Bannon was not part of Trump\u2019s official world for most of his presidential term, he is influential on the far right. Appearing later at the Turning Point Action event, Trump described Bannon as a \u201csmart cookie\u201d and told the crowd he tries to watch Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d broadcast whenever he can. Ousted from White House role in 2017 Bannon\u2019s tenure in Trump\u2019s White House was relatively short; he was fired in August 2017, part of a major reorganization under then-chief of staff John Kelly, who was brought in to control a chaotic atmosphere. In the years since, Bannon has continued to advocate for Trump \u2013 and Kelly, a retired general, has sounded the alarm about Trump\u2019s possible reelection. Bannon, meanwhile, now sounds like a more militant version of Trump, such as when he emphatically accuses Trump\u2019s opponents of trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election. There\u2019s no evidence for any kind of mass voter fraud, but that will not end this conspiracy theory. \u201cIf they steal this election \u2013 and they fully intend to steal it \u2013 this republic ends,\u201d Bannon said, before going on a riff about how top Department of Justice officials in President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, like Attorney General Merrick Garland, should be prosecuted; the FBI should be completely deconstructed; and anyone convicted in connection to the storming of the Capitol building would be set free. \u2018Purge\u2019 the DOJ, end the FBI \u201cWe are going to purge DOJ. We are going to take apart the FBI. The FBI, the American Gestapo \u2026 there\u2019s not going to be an FBI,\u201d he said. While Trump has only said he would be justified in going after political opponents, Bannon is committed to targeting anyone he views as having opposed Trump. \u201cWe are going to get every single receipt, and to the fullest extension of the law, you are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d he said. Preparing for a second term It is clear Bannon is looking well past Election Day as he rattled off a list of priorities for the MAGA movement. These included cutting off funding to Ukraine, massive cuts to government spending, beginning the process of ending the Federal Reserve, sealing the southern border, deporting 10 million to 15 million people and taking apart the administrative state. As chief strategist at the White House, Bannon was known for large whiteboards full of lists of priorities \u2013 things that still ring true in the priorities he outlined over the weekend. Courts, Congress and mismanagement kept Bannon and Trump from achieving many of these goals in Trump\u2019s first term. Clearly, Bannon is hoping for more success in a round two, particularly since the moderating forces of people like Kelly are unlikely to be involved in the administration. Bannon is not alone in planning for drastic changes if Trump wins in November. Anticipating the potential for a second Trump term, there are any number of supporters who are mapping out how to make the most of it. The conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, for instance, has written up its Project 2025 road map to remaking the civil service by firing large numbers of career servants and replacing them with more political voices. For a good, in-depth look at what Project 2025 would and would not do, listen this recent \u201cIn the Room\u201d podcast from Peter Bergen, CNN\u2019s national security analyst. Bergen talks to one of the authors of the State Department portion of Project 2025. Those plans from groups like Heritage, while plenty scary to an entire class of civil servants, sound relatively anodyne compared with Bannon\u2019s language. \u201cAre you prepared to fight? Are you prepared to give it all?\u201d he asked of young activists, telling them they would have to follow in the footsteps of \u201cthe team around President Trump\u201d \u2013 who he views as Roger Stone, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Alex Jones, people whose fidelity to conspiracy theories has gotten them into legal and financial trouble, but who in Bannon\u2019s mind are political freedom fighters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/bannon-trump-election-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis", "text": "Presidential debates crystalize a quadrennial dilemma for a country contemplating a new political direction. But they\u2019re usually defined more by trivial personality quirks, zeitgeist moments and gaffes than high-level ideological argument. Al Gore\u2019s melodramatic sighs, George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch, a day\u2019s growth on Richard Nixon\u2019s chin and Donald Trump\u2019s bulk looming over Hillary Clinton remain iconic years after the policy clashes in those debates have been forgotten. And while Thursday night\u2019s debate hosted by CNN between President Joe Biden and ex-President Trump could also turn on a theatrical flurry between two men who openly despise one another, the policy meat of a presidential debate has rarely been so important as in this neck-and-neck White House race. The country is confronting a perilous moment, internally estranged over politics and culture and as multiple foreign policy crises deepen. America faces a choice in November that will lead, like in Robert Frost\u2019s poem, down one of two divergent roads from which there may be no coming back. A charged political backdrop to a vital debate Trump\u2019s attempt to regain the White House, less than four years after he attempted to steal the last election, poses a potentially existential question for the democratic system. The former president\u2019s conservative backers are, meanwhile, proposing an evisceration of the bureaucracy and the politicization of judicial and intelligence leadership posts to reconcile the goals of a GOP candidate sporting one criminal conviction, three other indictments and a thirst for revenge. At the same time, and despite a roaring jobs market, millions of Americans are worn down by high prices and the cost of borrowing. The legacy of a once-in-a-generation pandemic robbed the country of a sense of economic security that Biden promised to restore four years ago but that remains elusive for many. The Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion two years ago has opened an ideological and religious schism over reproductive rights that Biden plans to exploit to hurt Trump. But the president is equally vulnerable over an immigration crisis on the southern border that has swamped asylum laws unfit to handle a new generation of migrants fleeing gangs, economic blight and climate disasters. Overseas, there\u2019s a frightening sense of fracturing. The global system that has enshrined American power for 80 years is under extreme pressure from US foes seeking to destroy it, including Russia and the new superpower China. Biden has dedicated his term to expanding NATO to counter the Kremlin\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine and threat to wider Europe. In one rare area of continuity with Trump, he\u2019s intensified a military and diplomatic pivot to counter China, although the ex-president\u2019s plan for a tariff war with Beijing would go far beyond Biden\u2019s efforts to stop a new Cold War turning hot. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which incessantly threatens to boil over, is a painful vulnerability for a sitting president, as his rival warns that World War III may be about to spark. Trump\u2019s main critique is that Biden is weak \u2013 a caricature that could resonate with some voters. But his own plans are as nebulous as his unlikely plan to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours and his unprovable claim that conflicts in Europe and the Middle East would \u201cnever have happened\u201d if he\u2019d been in office. And Trump seems more at home with authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who dream of crushing US power, than democratic allies America liberated in the last cataclysmic global conflict. Some of the ex-president\u2019s former White House officials warn he might try to pull the United States out of NATO, the cornerstone of Western security, if he returns to the White House. Voters must therefore pick between Biden\u2019s traditional internationalist foreign policies and a doubling down by Trump of the populist isolationism that turned the United States from the bulwark of global stability into one of its most volatile sources of instability. Two legacies on display For the first time in American history, two presidents will stand side-by-side on a debate stage with their legacies exposed for everyone to judge. (The only other time a former and current president competed for a second term was in 1892, when candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, let alone debate one another.) The meeting of incumbents is one most voters would have preferred to avoid. And so far, their fears seem to be realized. The tied race means two candidates either side of 80 are struggling to show they\u2019ve got the policies to fix the nation\u2019s problems. And neither so far has shown the vision to conjure a road map to the future that millions of Americans will inhabit long after both are gone. Trump\u2019s first term and sparse legislative record showed that he sees the presidency more as a channel for his wild personal whims rather than a policy laboratory. But his campaign, as well as allied conservative groups, have drawn up plans that, if implemented, would transform American governance. And a second-term administration stripped of restraining influences that frustrated the 45th president means he\u2019d have far more latitude to do what he wants. One irony of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and second term proposals \u2014 is that while he\u2019s shifted the Republican Party away from its corporate heritage toward a more working-class orientation, he pursues policies that disproportionately help richer Americans like himself. In his first term, he enacted tax cuts that favored the better off and he wants to extend them if he gets back the White House. Still, earlier this month, in an apparent bid to court support from hospitality workers in the key state of Nevada, he pledged to eliminate federal taxes on tips. And while he\u2019s proposing a draconian immigration policy, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants, Trump also says he wants more green cards for foreign graduates of US colleges \u2014 a step that may win favor among increasingly influential South Asian voters. The former president has also signaled he\u2019d dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in a move that would raise concerns of political interference in the central bank but that could please Americans who want interest rate cuts. And the former president is working hard to enhance nostalgia for the Trump economy that was thriving before the pandemic-induced economic crisis. If he concentrates on economic messaging rather than histrionics on Thursday night, the former president may be able to renew a connection with viewers alienated by his extreme behavior but who pine for easier economic times. Still, Biden is likely to argue that some of Trump\u2019s plans would be economically ruinous, including a proposed 10% tariff on foreign goods that some economists warn could reignite the inflation crisis and raise the cost of goods for US consumers. Biden has a humming policy machine. Several times a week, the president or Vice President Kamala Harris highlights a new aspect of the administration\u2019s attempt to honor its vows to reshape the economy, to lift up working Americans, to cut health care costs, cap drugs prices, create jobs, fight climate change, preserve abortion rights, reduce student debt and lower energy costs. But it is the curse of Biden\u2019s term that his efforts rarely get much credit despite a legislative legacy that is as impressive as any Democrat since President Lyndon Johnson. Part of this may lie in the fact that measures like Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure plan may take years to fully come into force. The president is still yet to figure out a way to claim credit for an economy that rebounded more strongly from the Covid-19 emergency than those of other developed countries while also acknowledging the pain many voters still feel. High grocery prices represent a literal and psychological barrier \u2014 even if the worst inflation crisis in 40 years has now moderated. It\u2019s still hard for many Americans to afford a new car or a mortgage because of high interest rates introduced to lower the cost of living. This leaves Biden badly needing to use Thursday night\u2019s debate to convince voters that he can make their lives better \u2014 and soon. He\u2019s tried it once already. During his State of the Union address in March, Biden praised citizens for authoring \u201cthe greatest comeback story.\u201d But it didn\u2019t do him any good politically. \u00a0In an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late April, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden on the economy and inflation, their top two issues, by margins of 46% to 32% and 44% to 30%. Post-game coverage of Thursday\u2019s debate is certain to zero in on the best verbal jabs, soundbites and the stamina and energy of the rival candidates. But the most meaningful impact of the clash between Trump and Biden will only begin to unfold after noon on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_us-hopes-netanyahu-adviser-can-give-clarity-on-gaza-war-plans-as-rift-with-israeli-leader-widens", "text": "American officials are hoping to gain a better understanding of Israel\u2019s war plans in meetings this week with the country\u2019s defense minister, who arrived in Washington as the rift widened between the Biden administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yoav Gallant has emerged as a top interlocutor for Biden advisers as the war in Gaza grinds on, and administration officials were hopeful the talks could yield greater clarity on Israel\u2019s plans after ambiguous statements from Netanyahu over the weekend about the end of the war. On Sunday, Netanyahu said during an interview on a conservative television station in Israel he was prepared to agree to a temporary pause in fighting in exchange for the release of some hostages in Gaza, while reiterating his position that the war will still continue after a ceasefire \u201cto achieve the goal of eliminating\u201d Hamas. That appeared at odds with the US-backed Israeli proposal on the release of hostages that would ultimately result in a permanent ceasefire. A day later, Netanyahu repeated his assertion the war wouldn\u2019t end until all the hostages are returned, but insisted he wasn\u2019t walking away from the Biden-endorsed ceasefire proposal. \u201cWe will not end the war until we return all of our hostages \u2013 120 hostages, the living and the deceased. We are committed to the Israeli proposal, which President Biden has welcomed. Our position has not changed,\u201d he said, speaking at the Knesset plenum on Monday. The two separate answers \u2014 delivered to two separate audiences \u2014 reflected the type of ambiguity from Netanyahu that has frustrated some Biden officials as they work to bring the fighting in Gaza to an end. His remarks threatened to further strain relations with the United States, which has actively rallied international support behind the proposal and worked to mediate an agreement. Netanyahu said that once the \u201cintense phase\u201d of the Gaza conflict is over Israel will continue \u201cmowing the grass\u201d in Gaza, which US officials oppose. \u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t know what he means exactly by that, but I think it probably means continued military engagement in Gaza. And for us, that\u2019s just a recipe for continued conflict, continued instability and continued insecurity for Israel,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said on Monday, adding that continued military engagement would \u201cbe extremely harmful to the people of Gaza and make \u201cIsrael weaker.\u201d In the interview, Netanyahu\u00a0also\u00a0said Israel would be transitioning to a new phase of fighting, which could be a precursor for Israel to send more troops to its northern border with Lebanon as it confronts Hezbollah militants. In the meetings this week, US officials will look to Gallant for a better understanding of how Israel is transitioning into a new phase of the conflict and for its plans in the north. Gallant spoke with CIA Director Bill Burns and US envoy Amos Hochstein about a \u201cPhase C\u201d of Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza, which an Israeli official described as a less intensive, more precise stage of the war. The official said Phase C was not a discussion about a \u201cday after\u201d plan for Gaza, a point on which Netanyahu has refused to engage. Last month, Gallant said that he has repeatedly brought up the topic of post-war plans for Gaza and the need for an alternative to Hamas in cabinet meetings, but \u201cthe issue was not raised for debate.\u201d Gallant had called on Netanyahu to declare that Israel would not establish civilian or military control over Gaza. But Netanyahu ignored the demand from his defense minister, refusing to make such a public statement. And former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who resigned from a unity government with Netanyahu two weeks ago, accused Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader of putting political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy. US officials have been similarly frustrated, waiting for Israel to lay out plans for post-war governance in Gaza and the rebuilding of the devastated enclave. The rising tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border have only complicated the situation. US officials have not explicitly told Israel that they oppose any attack against Hezbollah, but they are warning them that their actions could lead to a greater war that the two sides don\u2019t actually want, a US official said. Gallant\u2019s meetings this week with top officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, also come after Netanyahu has alleged the US is withholding weapons shipments to Israel. Gallant was mum as he left the State Department after a lengthy meeting with Blinken Monday afternoon. Miller said Monday that the US would \u201clook to make progress\u201d on a raft of issues, including day after plans for Gaza and stemming further escalation of the conflict, during that meeting. White House officials have brushed off some of Netanyahu\u2019s comments as motivated by politics as he works to maintain a fragile grip on power. But they nonetheless caused deep frustration inside the White House. After saying last week they had no idea what Netanyahu was talking about, and describing his claims as \u201cvexing, disappointing and incorrect,\u201d the White House said over the weekend it would not engage in an extended back and forth with Netanyahu. \u201cWe have made our position clear on this repeatedly and we are not going to keep responding to the Prime Minister\u2019s political statements,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cWe look forward to constructive consultations with the Defense Minister in Washington this week.\u201d Still, on Monday during the daily State Department briefing, Miller responded to Netanyahu\u2019s comments over the weekend, saying, \u201cThose of us who speak publicly sometime misspeak and when it happens we have an obligation to clarify and we are glad that he did.\u201d Leaving for Washington, Gallant reiterated the importance of Israel\u2019s relations with Washington. \u201cThe United States is our most important and central ally. Our ties are crucial and perhaps more important than ever, at this time,\u201d\u00a0Gallant\u00a0told reporters prior to departure from Israel, according to a statement from the Israeli defense ministry on Sunday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/us-hopes-netanyahu-adviser-can-give-clarity-on-gaza-war-plans-as-rift-with-israeli-leader-widens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history", "text": "Former President Donald Trump made\u00a0more than two dozen false claims\u00a0at his Tuesday campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin, including two significant attempts to rewrite Wisconsin history. The\u00a0first\u00a0was a slightly vaguer than usual version of his\u00a0familiar\u00a0lie that he won Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. He lost the state\u00a0by\u00a020,682\u00a0votes. The second was a version of a false claim Trump\u00a0delivered\u00a0in 2020 and again in 2022: his\u00a0assertion\u00a0that he had saved the Wisconsin city of Kenosha from destruction in 2020 when Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, refused to take action to deal with the civil unrest that followed the police shooting of a Black man. \u201cBy the way, you know, Kenosha: I saved Kenosha, do you know that? When I was president. Right? Right? I saved it,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cKenosha was \u2014 Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes and the governor wouldn\u2019t move, he just wouldn\u2019t move, and I moved. You know, I\u2019m not supposed to; it\u2019s supposed to be the governor, is supposed to do it, the mayor and the governor.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that Evers \u201cwouldn\u2019t move\u201d and that Trump was the person who \u201csaved Kenosha\u201d are false, as numerous fact-checkers\u00a0pointed out\u00a0when he made similar claims\u00a0in\u00a02020. Evers, not Trump, deployed the Wisconsin National Guard during the rioting in Kenosha \u2014 and Evers first deployed the\u00a0Guard the day before Trump publicly demanded that Evers do so. In other words, Trump insisted that Evers do something that he was already doing. Trump has repeatedly made a near-identical false claim about another state, Minnesota, that had a Democratic governor and civil unrest in 2020. Though Trump has asserted that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis over the objection of Gov. Tim Walz,\u00a0it was Walz who deployed the\u00a0Guard to Minneapolis hours before Trump demanded that he do so. The 2020\u00a0unrest in Kenosha, which involved both peaceful protests and acts of violence and vandalism, followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake by a White police officer who was\u00a0responding to a domestic disturbance call on August 23, 2020. (State and federal law enforcement later\u00a0decided\u00a0not to file charges against the officer.) On Tuesday, after Trump repeated his false claim, the governor\u2019s office provided CNN with the same\u00a0timeline it had sent to reporters when Trump had made the claim in 2020. The timeline, which is corroborated by public evidence, conclusively debunks Trump\u2019s narrative. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on the night of August 25, 2020, that the\u00a0\u201cgovernor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin.\u201d But the governor had already done so by then.\u00a0Evers authorized the deployment of 125 Wisconsin National Guard troops\u00a0just after 3 a.m.\u00a0the\u00a0day prior to the tweet, then\u00a0doubled\u00a0the deployment to 250 troops on the afternoon of the tweet \u2013 more than four hours before Trump weighed in. Evers continued to deploy more Wisconsin National Guard troops in the coming days, and he also\u00a0accepted\u00a0National Guard troops from three other states; they were never federalized. Evers did accept limited federal assistance from the\u00a0US Marshals Service\u00a0and the FBI, his office said, but that\u2019s no basis for Trump\u2019s claims that he saved the city when Evers wouldn\u2019t. The idea that the city\u2019s very existence was ever threatened is also\u00a0questionable, but we\u2019ll leave that aside here.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_trump-biden-debate-expectations-analysis", "text": "After months lampooning President Joe Biden as a cognitively impaired \u201cbrain-dead zombie\u201d who can\u2019t finish a sentence or navigate off a stage, former President Donald Trump and his campaign are changing their tune days ahead of the critical debate of the election. The commander in chief has suddenly morphed into a \u201cworthy debater,\u201d someone of considerable ability and a veteran political performer who is not to be underestimated, according to Trump and his lieutenants. The game of pre-debate expectation-setting is often absurd \u2013 one aide to former President George W. Bush once claimed that John Kerry, his Democratic opponent in 2004, was a better debater than Roman rhetorician Cicero. But the Trump team\u2019s shift is remarkable given their relentless assault on Biden\u2019s faculties. And it hints at their possible concerns that they\u2019ve set an unnecessarily low bar for the president\u2019s performance ahead of Thursday\u2019s clash hosted by CNN in Atlanta. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a possible Trump vice presidential pick, tried to reset the balance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe guy\u2019s run for office more than a dozen times. He\u2019s run for president four times. He\u2019s been campaigning since President Nixon was in office,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy has got the ability.\u201d Trump is also hedging against a stronger-than-expected Biden showing by suggesting his opponent will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs to ensure a strong performance. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is intensifying its new attempt to portray Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d criminal who is morally reprobate, out to benefit his rich friends and unfit for a return to the Oval Office. The president\u2019s campaign, which is marking the second anniversary of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal this week and making abortion a key election issue, promised in a memo Sunday that the head-to-head would finally show voters the contrast Biden believes will disqualify Trump. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments of this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people, and Donald Trump, who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. A moment that could define the campaign \u2013 and America\u2019s future The outlandish claims and pregame spin reflect the vital importance of the debate, with the rematch between Biden and Trump neck-and-neck just over four months from Election Day. The showdown comes amid bitterness between the rivals, especially in the wake of Trump falsely claiming that he won the 2020 election. The shadow of Trump\u2019s criminal conviction \u2013 and his sentencing in New York next month \u2013 is adding an extra level of tension at a time when the ex-president is threatening to use a second term to exact revenge against his enemies and as Biden warns Trump will destroy democracy. Trump\u2019s use of his weekend events as warm-ups contrasts with Biden\u2019s measured approach. The president is sequestered at Camp David in Maryland with a large team of aides and debate experts preparing for a meeting with Trump that could define his reelection bid. Millions of voters on Thursday will have a chance to assess the energy, endurance and mental sharpness of an 81-year-old president who has visibly aged and slowed in office as polls show most Americans think he\u2019s too old to serve another term. Fewer voters worry about the cognitive health of Trump, who is only three years younger at 78. But the ex-president\u2019s brash behavior, attacks on the judicial system and facts, and admiration for foreign dictators, which delight his supporters, often alienate swing-state suburban voters who are likely to decide the next president. But the debate cuts deeper than personalities. Voters hurting from years of high prices and craving the return to the full pre-pandemic normality that Biden promised four years ago will be waiting to hear how the candidates can ease the economic pressure bearing down on their families. Biden\u2019s campaign is signaling he will present himself as a force of stability addressing the needs of families that contrasts with Trump\u2019s \u201cdark vision\u201d and the GOP\u2019s threats to abortion rights. The ex-president is, meanwhile, lambasting Biden as blind to a southern border crisis and what he claims are cities scarred by crime, while trying to conjure nostalgia for the Trump economy before the Covid-19 crash. Trump\u2019s change of tone Trump appeared in Washington, DC, at a conference of Christian conservatives on Saturday before heading to Philadelphia, seeking to seize back a state Biden won in 2020 and without which either man may struggle to get to 270 electoral votes. He mocked Biden for going to a \u201clog cabin to study, prepare\u201d and claimed the president was sleeping at Camp David \u201cbecause they want to get him good and strong, so a little before debate time he gets a shot in the a**.\u201d Trump added:\u00a0\u201cI say he\u2019ll come out all jacked up, right?\u201d The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s suggestions of chemical intervention mirrored his response to Biden\u2019s barnstorming State of the Union address earlier this year when a fired-up president make a mockery of conservative media expectations that he\u2019d stumble during the speech and instead countered their narrative of mental decline. Trump tempered earlier assessments of Biden\u2019s likely performance in an interview with the \u201cAll-In Podcast\u201d released Thursday. \u201cHe beat Paul Ryan,\u201d Trump said, referring to the vice presidential debate in 2012 when Biden dispatched Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. \u201cI\u2019m not underestimating him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI assume he\u2019s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater.\u201d Burgum also sought to manage expectations on \u201cState of the Union\u201d in a way that appeared to undercut the Trump campaign\u2019s long-held position that Biden is no longer fit to serve as president. \u201cWhen he needs to, he can step up,\u201d he told Kaitlan Collins. \u201cThis guy has got the ability \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve seen him in debate four years ago. We\u2019ve seen him in the State of the Union this year \u2013 that when he needs to, he can step up.\u201d Burgum\u2019s assessment is inconsistent with the ex-president\u2019s portrayal of his rival in even some of his most recent appearances. In the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week, for instance, Trump said of Biden: \u201cHe can\u2019t find his way off a stage ever.\u201d After conservative media highlighted deceptively edited video of Biden at the G7 summit in Italy this month, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt accused the president of \u201cwandering around like a brain-dead zombie\u201d and of putting \u201ccognitive decline on full display.\u201d CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Trump campaign\u2019s reversal had been \u201cfun to watch.\u201d He noted Trump spent the last five years \u201cdescribing Biden as utterly incompetent, to the point where, if Biden arrives and leaves under his own power, that would be a triumph. \u2026 I think they have recognized in the last couple of weeks, \u2018Whoa, this guy is going to exceed those expectations and we\u2019d better start creating a rationale for him having a decent night.\u2019\u201d \u2018A magnifying glass on the choice\u2019 The former president has insisted he won\u2019t be participating in mock debates, though he has held what were described as policy forums with Republicans, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another potential vice presidential contender. There is growing speculation about Trump\u2019s approach after his hyper-aggressive and angry performance in the first debate against Biden in 2020 backfired. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem had some advice for the ex-president on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has to get personal in this debate at all because he\u2019s going to have so many good things to talk about, in contrast with Joe Biden\u2019s policies,\u201d she said. Unlike Trump, who spent the weekend creating headlines, Biden hunkered down at the presidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park north of Washington. At his side were former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation, and other long-term loyalists including Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed, Anita Dunn and Steve Ricchetti. Former Obama White House counsel and Biden\u2019s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, who sources said was likely to reprise his role playing Trump in debate prep, was also on hand. In its memo, the Biden campaign said that Team Biden-Harris is putting a \u201cmagnifying glass on the choice this week as Democrats in Atlanta and across the country organize around this moment.\u201d The comparison on show even before the debate epitomizes the rivals\u2019 opposite approaches to the presidency. Trump is public, abrasive, profane and as ever flouting the expectations of traditional statesmanship. Biden is conventional, cautious and seeking to restore the norms that Trump once trashed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/trump-biden-debate-expectations-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_trump-vice-president-auditions-analysis", "text": "Being Donald Trump\u2019s vice president didn\u2019t end well for Mike Pence \u2014 but there\u2019s no sign his painful split from the ex-president over his anti-constitutional demands is scaring off any of the hopefuls keen to slip into his shoes. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s search for a new number two is expected to culminate with a dramatic unveiling at the Republican National Convention in a month, likely choreographed to engineer a TV ratings bump. At various points, the list of possible contenders has included Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Trump shattered all conventions about the business of running for president and serving in the Oval Office. And putting potential running mates through a televised audition process is no exception. The old school playbook in which possible nominees feign a lack of interest in the post to maximize their chances of getting it is antithetical to Trump\u2019s way of operating. Possible picks trying to catch Trump\u2019s eye go on television, knowing he\u2019s probably watching, and sprinkle compliments, talk up his chances of winning, amplify his voter fraud conspiracy theories and slam his criminal conviction. Some have made clear that they wouldn\u2019t have done what Pence did on January 6, 2021, when he concluded that he did not have power to change the outcome of the 2020 election in Congress. The almost total adoption of Trump\u2019s mantras suggests that the experience of the last Republican vice president \u2014 who was hunted with calls of \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d by members of the Trump mob that attacked the Capitol \u2014 is not giving them much pause. This despite history suggesting that, at some point in their potential mandate, a possible President Trump might ask them to so something that tests their consciences, the law or the Constitution. The attractiveness of the vice presidential nomination may reflect Trump\u2019s magnetism and the heady euphoria of being a key player in the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. For people who are wired with ambition, whether up-and-coming politicians or those who have always dreamed of the presidency but have fallen short, the vice presidency can be an attractive proposition. The job has many indignities, which include always being overshadowed by the boss, taking foreign trips he doesn\u2019t want to do, and having no real formal duties apart from being a constitutional safety net if the president dies. But the increasing belief among Republicans that the presidency is there for the taking this year \u2014 evident from their bullish public statements \u2014 means a spot on Trump\u2019s ticket is a hot ticket. And morbidly, there\u2019s a chance to be a heartbeat away from the presidency alongside a commander in chief who would be 82 by the end of his term. In many ways, Pence created a template right up until the moment in the last two weeks of his tenure that fractured his relationship with his president and ruined his post-West Wing political career. He could hardly have been more loyal to Trump, even through the ex-president\u2019s botched handling of a once-in-a-century pandemic, and at times that loyalty manifested as misty-eyed veneration. A Trump heir? Trump may not think about what will happen to his MAGA movement when he\u2019s no longer active in politics. But a second-term vice president might also be positioned to become his political heir \u2014 a proposition especially appealing to someone like Vance, a 39-year-old who has transformed himself from a harsh Trump critic to MAGA prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The first-term senator has not been afraid to advance his own credentials. In strikingly frank comments on Fox News on Monday, he said, \u201cIf Trump picks up the phone and calls you, the first sort of thought you have to have with yourself is not just, could I be vice president, but could I stand ultimately in the big chair? And look, if he asked me, I\u2019ll think about it, but I think the answer is yes,\u201d he said. The Ohio Republican said that he\u2019d not been asked about the job by Trump but made clear in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in May that he wasn\u2019t put off by what happened to Pence on January 6, 2021, after Trump publicly called on him to use his power as vice president to oversee the counting of Electoral College votes to cancel out President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger,\u201d Vance said. He has also made clear to Trump that he wouldn\u2019t have adopted Pence\u2019s interpretation of the constitutional limits on vice presidential powers. \u201cIf I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there,\u201d Vance told ABC News in February. \u201cThat is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that\u2019s what we should have done.\u201d There is no constitutional justification for such a course of action. Vance\u2019s potential rivals for a spot on Trump\u2019s ticket Vance is one of several potential vice presidential nominees, along with Rubio and Burgum, who have been sent vetting materials by the Trump campaign, CNN reported earlier this month. Burgum has taken a classic route of parlaying an unsuccessful presidential campaign into a spot in the vice presidential derby. In some ways, he\u2019s similar to Pence, who was a deeply conservative Indiana governor. The North Dakota governor has also shown the kind of unquestioning loyalty that Trump prizes. He\u2019s rich, a self-made businessman and is the kind of person with whom the ex-president has spent his life in boardrooms and golf clubs. And he\u2019s not flamboyant enough to steal the once and possibly future president\u2019s headlines. Burgum has said that he believes that Biden won the 2020 election, but has also raised concerns about its fairness, playing into Trump\u2019s false claims that changes in electoral practices to account for the Covid-19 emergency amount to fraud. And he\u2019s also endeared himself to the ex-president by downplaying his criminal conviction in New York for falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to a former adult film star as a mere trifle over accounting. Rubio has taken a lower-key approach compared to some of his rivals. But the Florida senator, who many people in Washington think still nurtures presidential ambitions after losing in humiliating fashion to Trump in the 2016 primary, appears to have been trying to make himself more palatable as a vice presidential pick. He has fervently criticized Trump\u2019s conviction in New York and in May said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he\u2019d only accept the result of the 2024 election if it was fair \u2014 despite the lack of any indication that it wouldn\u2019t be. On the same show, he signaled that despite his past ridicule of Trump on the 2016 campaign trail, and many of his original positions on issues like foreign policy and immigration that seem to clash with the ex-president, he\u2019d be ready to serve alongside him. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s offered that job to serve this country in the second highest office \u2014 assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment \u2014 if you\u2019re interested in serving the country, it\u2019s an incredible place to serve,\u201d he said. More recently, Rubio has been conjuring speculation about a possible inside track to the VP job by joining Trump for policy discussions ahead of the first presidential debate on CNN next Thursday. While most of the focus has been on Rubio, Burgum and Vance, Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach and love of keeping people off balance means that a surprise pick can\u2019t be ruled out. One potential candidate whose star seems to have dimmed is South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who rolled out a book earlier this year in an apparent bid to boost her chances but became mired in a controversy over her tale of shooting the family dog. In an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on June 9, Noem looked like she was trying to revive her candidacy, as she urged Trump to pick a female running mate. \u201cAll the polls tell him in these swing states that a woman on the ticket helps him win. The polls just say that,\u201d she said. Referring to a campaign trip to Wisconsin, a critical swing state, the South Dakota governor said independent voters and those leaning toward Trump \u201calso want to know that their perspective is going to be at the table when decisions are made.\u201d Less than a month before Trump is expected to make his choice, there\u2019s no real clarity on who it will be. And that\u2019s how the ex-president likes it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/trump-vice-president-auditions-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_joe-biden-donald-trump-strategy", "text": "Several top Democrats have issued stark warnings to President Joe Biden\u2019s camp, urging them to spend more time going directly after former President Donald Trump and less time \u2013 if any \u2013 pointing to the president\u2019s policy record. The reason is simple: Talking about Biden\u2019s policy achievements is not resonating with voters. \u201cHe wants the credit, but it\u2019s not working,\u201d one top Democrat, who recently shared these concerns with the campaign, said of Biden. \u201cHe needs to stop.\u201d Speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations with the campaign, four sources\u00a0close to the White House\u00a0said they\u2019ve\u00a0urged the Biden camp to go on offense\u00a0on the economy, using the time on the debate stage to challenge Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with corporate America and the inflationary nature of his proposed policies.\u00a0Biden and Trump square off in the first presidential debate at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday live on CNN. The behind-the-scenes warnings echo concerns raised by Biden\u2019s longtime aide, Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s first chief of staff who is also prepping the president for Thursday\u2019s debate in lasagna-fueled sessions at Camp David. Earlier this year, Klain reportedly remarked to a private crowd that Biden was spending too much\u00a0time\u00a0praising bridges that were being built instead of connecting with voters. The White House at the time denied that Klain\u2019s views were a departure from their strategy.  \u201cKlain gets it,\u201d one of the sources said of the former chief of staff, who is taking vacation from his job as Airbnb\u2019s chief legal officer to return to a role as debate coach. That\u2019s a departure for Biden,\u00a0a lifelong politician who\u00a0has grown accustomed to seeking credit\u00a0when he feels\u00a0credit is due, especially as the list of accomplishments has grown longer.\u00a0His\u00a0frustration\u00a0when he feels that credit is withheld can be apparent. During a May interview in Racine, Wisconsin \u2013 where Biden had just announced a multi-billion-dollar investment at a site where a similar pledge under Trump had not materialized \u2013 Biden visibly bristled when asked why voters still preferred his predecessor\u2019s economic policies, and whether he could turn that sentiment around. \u201cWe\u2019ve already turned it around \u2026 the polling data has been wrong all along,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, challenging the suggestion that economic output had been lower than expected and pointing to job creation as proof the US has \u201cthe best economy in the world.\u201d This\u00a0election, the sources who spoke to CNN argued,\u00a0is different than any other reelection race Biden has run. While the US economy has defied\u00a0predictions of\u00a0a recession, instead producing blockbuster job growth and output, that strength has driven up prices for consumers and businesses. To stanch that, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates,\u00a0making borrowing to buy a car or house much more expensive, too. As a result, the economy has become both the biggest priority for voters and their biggest frustration with the incumbent president. An ABC News/Ipsos poll in May found more than 80% of respondents said the economy and inflation were important in determining their vote - and on both issues, Trump notched a 14-point lead over Biden. In a CNN poll out in late April,\u00a0Biden\u2019s approval ratings for the economy (34%) and inflation (29%) remained starkly negative, as voters said economic concerns were more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential contests. In early June, the Biden reelection campaign rolled out a new ad in battleground states in both English and Spanish, highlighting Biden\u2019s working-class roots and his\u00a0familiarity with\u00a0the working-class struggle. And in recent months, he has backed away from boasting about \u201cBidenomics\u201d and begun to embrace messaging that there is more work to do, acknowledging that his policies haven\u2019t fully solved the economic woes\u00a0of the post-pandemic era. And on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s reelection campaign seized on the final countdown to Thursday night\u2019s highly anticipated CNN presidential debate by arguing that a second Trump presidency would do nothing to help the middle class. \u201cDonald Trump loves to attack Joe Biden because he\u2019s focused on revenge and he has no plan to help the middle class,\u201d the narrator says in a newly released ad that is part of what the Biden campaign says is a $50 million paid media campaign targeting battleground voters in June. The ad goes on to say that Biden worked to cap the cost of insulin, lower health care costs and \u201cmade big corporations pay their fair share\u201d \u2013 a list that the Biden White House and campaign has frequently touted in recent months as having helped lower- and middle-class Americans. Biden, too, has targeted shrinkflation - the moniker for paying the same price for a good that\u2019s gotten smaller -\u00a0joking to an audience\u00a0of hospitality leaders in February that the size of Snickers had gone down 10%, but the price is still the same. But\u00a0his natural proclivity has been to try to convince people\u00a0they\u00a0should feel better about the economy,\u00a0by\u00a0using the data that supports that view. \u201cImagine spending 50 years of your life in politics, and now becoming\u00a0the\u00a0guy. You want people to know you\u2019re doing a really good job,\u201d one major donor told CNN. \u201cI think Biden can\u2019t help but talk about what a good job he\u2019s done.\u201d CNN\u2019s MJ Lee contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump-strategy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The justices\u2019 refusal to get involved will potentially make it much harder for challenges to such at-large systems of voting \u2013 that challengers call a \u201crelic of Jim Crow\u201d \u2013 to move forward in three states in the South. The five members of Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission are each elected in staggered, statewide votes \u2013 a system that a federal judge said violated the Voting Rights Act. That ruling was then reversed by the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, prompting the Black voters\u2019 appeal to the Supreme Court. In declining to take up the case Monday, the Supreme Court did not say anything on the merits of the arguments. However, the move leaves standing an 11th Circuit precedent that could affect other Voting Rights Act lawsuits brought in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, the three states the circuit covers. The 11th Circuit concluded that the Black voters\u2019 challenge failed because they did not put forward a remedy to cure the alleged vote dilution that would maintain the at-large system the state had chosen for the commission. In their request, the voters noted that, if allowed to stand, the 11th Circuit precedent would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for other Voting Rights Act challenges to be brought against at-large election schemes, including challenges to local entities \u2013 like school boards \u2013 that use that method of election. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in court briefs that the Supreme Court should not take up the case and stressed the \u201cunique\u201d nature of the commission, which is Georgia\u2019s regulator for investor-owned utilities like power plants and telecommunications. His brief suggested that the appeals court did not foreclose challenges to other government entities that use at-large methods of election. \u201cIn other cases, with other government bodies, the outcome may be different, and there is no reason to intervene here, specifically,\u201d the Georgia brief said. In an earlier phase of the case, the Supreme Court sided with the Black voters by restoring a trial court order that delayed the 2022 elections of two of the commission seats so that the legislature could create a new system of electing the commissioners.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/supreme-court-georgia-minority-vote-dilution/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_supreme-court-to-decide-whether-states-can-restrict-gender-affirming-care-for-minors", "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear the Biden administration\u2019s challenge to a transgender care ban in Tennessee, delving into the complicated and politically fraught issue of gender-affirming care in a substantive way for the first time. The state law, enacted last year, bans hormone therapy and puberty blockers for minors and imposes civil penalties for doctors who violate the prohibitions. It is among a growing number of state laws enacted in recent years targeting transgender care. Nearly half of US states have enacted bans on transgender care for minors, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The case will be heard this fall. \u201cThe Supreme Court was always going to have to resolve how state bans on gender-affirming medical care can be reconciled with its approach to sex-based discrimination,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cToday\u2019s grant sets up this issue as one of the early blockbusters for the Court\u2019s upcoming term.\u201d Laws in Kentucky and Tennessee were challenged by the Biden administration and families of transgender minors. The Supreme Court only agreed to hear the challenge filed by the Biden administration in Tennessee. In September, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati reversed a district court ruling that blocked the gender-affirming care ban from being enforced. In other words, the appeals court allowed the ban to take effect. Republican lawmakers who support the ban say decisions about care should be made after an individual becomes an adult. Opponents argue that in addition to violating the civil rights of trans youth, the laws also run afoul of parents\u2019 rights to make decisions about their child\u2019s medical care. Tennessee\u2019s law says that medical providers cannot perform procedures that \u201cenable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201ctreat purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d The legal fights over similar bans have been moving through federal courts for more than a year. In April, the Supreme Court allowed Idaho officials to temporarily enforce a strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, although it did so on a temporary basis without resolving the underlying questions posed by the case. Several groups that advocate for transgender youth called on the Supreme Court to strike down Tennessee\u2019s law. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: Everyone deserves access to the medical care that they need, and transgender and non-binary young people are no exception,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cNo politician should be able to interfere in decisions that are best made between families and doctors, particularly when that care is necessary and best practice.\u201d Lucas Cameron-Vaughn, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, criticized state lawmakers for using the bans to \u201cfuel divisions for their own political gain.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to recognize that for trans youth and their families, this isn\u2019t about politics,\u201d Cameron-Vaughn said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the fundamental freedom to access vital, life-saving healthcare.\u201d Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, said his office looks forward to defending the law. \u201cThis case will bring much-needed clarity to whether the Constitution contains special protections for gender identity,\u201d he said.

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_special-counsel-mar-a-lago-documents-trump", "text": "Prosecutors with special counsel Jack Smith\u00a0in a filing late Monday night\u00a0pushed back on former President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to toss\u00a0the classified documents case against him\u00a0over how\u00a0materials found in boxes during the\u00a0FBI\u2019s\u00a02022 Mar-a-Lago\u00a0search\u00a0were handled by investigators. Prosecutors, with several never-before-seen images and a 30-page filing, detailed the search process and ridiculed Trump\u2019s legal arguments. \u201cTrump personally chose to keep documents containing some of the nation\u2019s most highly guarded secrets in cardboard boxes,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201calong with a collection of other personally chosen keepsakes of various sizes and shapes from his presidency\u2014newspapers, thank you notes, Christmas ornaments, magazines, clothing, and photographs of himself and others.\u201d The latest Trump bid to toss the case came after prosecutors acknowledged that some of the documents fell out of order within their individual boxes after they were seized by the government. \u00a0\u00a0Trump\u2019s attorneys have previously argued that because the order of contents in boxes was changed, it impacts their ability to build a defense around when certain classified material was placed in each box, given where it was inside Mar-a-Lago and what documents \u2013 including news articles \u2013 were beside it. The new filing from Smith\u2019s team goes into granular detail about how the search was conducted, the protocols FBI agents followed, and how certain documents were taken out of the boxes and by whom. The prosecutors highlighted how investigators found boxes with their contents spilled on the floor, which they also illustrated with photos taken by investigators and by one of Trump\u2019s co-defendants. \u201cAgainst this backdrop of the haphazard manner in which Trump chose to maintain his boxes\u201d Trump argues that the precise order of the contents \u201cwas critical to his defense,\u201d prosecutors said, ridiculing the argument. To bolster their arguments, the prosecutors attached several new photos of the boxes, some of which were taken during the search.\u00a0Two\u00a0photos\u00a0were\u00a0taken by Trump co-defendant and valet Walt Nauta in December 2021, when he was moving boxes into Trump\u2019s residence for review\u00a0and found that some of the boxes had fallen. Other photos were taken during the search and prosecutors included some photos to show the news clippings, personal effects, and mementos that were found mixed in with sensitive government materials. Prosecutors also say that the \u201cintegrity of each container in which the evidence was found, that is, box-to-box integrity\u201d has been maintained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNothing has been lost, much less destroyed, and there has been no bad faith,\u201d they added. To push back on defense attorneys\u2019 claim that internal FBI emails suggested that the agents long knew there was an issue with how the boxes were seized, the prosecutors revealed what the emails actually concerned: that a witness discovered additional classified material at Mar-a-Lago the day after the August 2022 search. Prosecutors argued that Trump\u2019s previous remarks about the documents \u2013 including that he designated them his personal documents and declassified them \u2013 contradict the defense that the order of the documents would help prove that he was ignorant of the boxes\u2019 contents. \u201cThe Court should see Trump\u2019s newly invented explanations and his motion for what they are\u2014his latest unfounded accusations against law enforcement professionals doing their jobs,\u201d they wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/special-counsel-mar-a-lago-documents-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_biden-trump-character-attacks", "text": "Joe Biden is throwing everything at Donald Trump. The president and his campaign are blasting the presumptive Republican nominee as a criminal and a racist who was found liable for sexual assault and who is now being driven so \u201ccrazy\u201d by his loss in 2020 that he\u2019s been left \u201cunhinged.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most\u00a0searing portrayals in the modern age by an incumbent president of his challenger and is designed to define the 45th president as flagrantly unfit for a return to the office he left in disgrace in 2021. With his two impeachments, a criminal conviction and an attempt to overturn the last election, Trump gave Biden plenty to work with. But Biden\u2019s strategy may also tell the story of a reelection campaign that is going nowhere near as well as the president must have hoped, as he battles diminished standing across swathes of the electorate and faces a dauntingly narrow path to the 270 electoral voters needed to win in November. New fundraising figures announced by Biden and the Democratic Party on Thursday reveal that Trump and his team outraised the president for the second month in a row, largely erasing what was a financial advantage held by Biden for much of the campaign cycle. For months, Biden\u2019s team has argued that when the choice between the president and his predecessor became clear to voters, the stakes of the election would shift the political equation in his favor. The theory was that voters were slow to tune into the race and that they may need reminding about the chaos and the discord of Trump\u2019s first term that ended in the worst assault on democracy in generations. But it\u2019s now midsummer, and the election is less than five months away. There\u2019s every sign the race is still shaping up as much as a referendum on Biden \u2013 and a weary populace\u2019s lost sense of economic security \u2013 as it is on the threat to the rule of law that Trump is making clear a second term would entail. The president\u2019s campaign is therefore intensifying an effort to highlight the perceived consequences of a new White House mandate for Trump, who has pledged to use presidential power to exact personal retribution, while conservative groups polish blueprints for an overhaul of the bureaucracy, energy, and economic policy. Biden\u2019s best chance to reset the choice comes in his first debate with Trump on CNN in six days \u2014 a confrontation that the Biden campaign is trying to shape with daily attacks on Trump, looking to appeal to demographic groups the president hopes will return him to the White House. Some small shifts toward the president have emerged in some polling since Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in his hush money in New York last month. But the race has been mostly stable with no clear leader for months, which should be troubling to a president who is asking voters to reward him with a new term. Biden\u2019s best chance for a reset Thursday\u2019s debate will also represent the president\u2019s opportunity before tens of millions of television viewers to counter the bleak character sketch Trump is conjuring of him. The ex-president portrays his rival as a doddering incompetent who can\u2019t make it to the end of a sentence. This picture is exaggerated. But polls show that most Americans worry about the age and capacity of a president who has noticeably slowed physically in recent years and who would be 86 by the end of a second term. Trump isn\u2019t much younger, and if he wins, he\u2019d be the oldest president, at 78, to begin a second term. Biden has been road testing his character attacks on Trump for weeks in fundraising events and they\u2019re now increasingly being parroted by campaign officials. At a fundraiser attended by former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in northern Virginia on Tuesday, Biden laid out a stark scenario that included a warning that his rival was waging an all-out assault on the legal system. \u201cThe threat Trump poses would be greater in a second term than it was in his first term.\u00a0You know \u2026 I think he\u00a0snapped\u00a0when he lost in 2020.\u00a0He can\u2019t accept he lost.\u00a0(It\u2019s) literally driving him crazy. \u2026 He\u2019s not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he\u2019s clearly a little bit unhinged right now.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has been seizing the initiative all week as it lays the groundwork for the message it clearly hopes Americans will take away from the debate. On Monday, it debuted a hard-hitting new ad. \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself,\u201d the narrator says as the former president\u2019s mug shot splashes across the screen. \u201cAnd a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The gambit erased any doubt over how Biden will seek to exploit a guilty verdict against Trump and his three other criminal indictments to which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty. The ex-president\u2019s campaign will respond by claiming Biden\u2019s strategy is proof of an attempt to weaponize the justice system against him. But since Trump\u2019s campaign is already spinning that narrative anyway, Biden may have little to lose. The ad, part of a $50 million ad buy in June online, on battleground state TV channels and on national cable, references the hush money trial and Trump\u2019s losses in a defamation suit to the writer E. Jean Carroll and a civil fraud trial. Captions laid over dark, monochrome photos of Trump at court read \u201cConvicted \u2014 34 Felonies\u201d; \u201cLiable for Sexual Assault\u201d; \u201cCommitted Financial Fraud.\u201d Then, the video flips into full color with a shot of a beaming Biden surrounded by workers while it touts his efforts to cut health care costs and take on corporations. The contrast could not be more striking, and the Biden campaign must hope that it at last begins to take root in voters\u2019 minds. \u201cThe people of America are going to very soon have a choice between Donald Trump, who wakes up every day thinking about himself, thinking about his billionaire friends and then thinks about how he\u2019s going to hurt people that he thinks have hurt him,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d on Thursday. \u201cJoe Biden wakes up every day fighting for the American people, making sure that we\u2019re going to protect people\u2019s freedoms, protect democracy and lower costs,\u201d Landrieu told Manu Raju. Biden seeks to move the goalposts with ads during soccer tournament The Biden campaign is now making daily pitches to a significant corner of his coalition showing signs of stress. Wednesday, the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the US, saw a stinging attack on Trump, designed to thwart his attempt to make inroads with Black voters \u2013 a vital Democratic voting block. \u201cAfter a lifetime of racism and in honor of the holiday, the least Trump could do is give Black America a day off from his campaign\u2019s racist, empty pandering,\u201d Jasmine Harris, the campaign\u2019s director of Black media, said in a statement. \u201cBlack voters have had enough \u2013 and they\u2019re ready to put an end to Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d The campaign also sent around a list of the many race controversies precipitated by Trump during his lifetime, including his call for the execution of five Black youths over the sexual assault of a woman in Central Park, New York, who were later found to be wrongly convicted, and his long-running racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. During the 2020 election, CNN exit polls showed that Trump got around 12% of the votes of Black Americans. But some recent opinion polls suggest he\u2019s currently getting around 20%. That kind of performance in 2024 could squeeze Biden\u2019s margins in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where he needs strong Black turnout in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee to counter Trump\u2019s strong advantage in more rural areas. On Thursday, the Biden campaign turned to Hispanic voters \u2014 another key voting bloc where polls suggest he is underperforming. His campaign laid a seven-figure bet on the Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2014 the international soccer tournament featuring Western hemisphere men\u2019s teams that Lionel Messi and his World Cup-winning Argentina team kicked off in Atlanta on Thursday night. A new ad featuring the president and slamming Trump will air during games over the next few weeks as Biden\u2019s campaign seeks to remind Latino voters about Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cFour years ago, we were shut down. Stadiums were empty. Trump failed us,\u201d a narrator says over images of empty stadiums, arguing that Biden reopened the country and created 15.6 million jobs. The ad then cuts to a shot of Biden in what looks like a sports bar as the soundtrack plays the \u201cGoalllllllllllllll!\u201d cry that South American commentators use when the ball hits the back of the net. According to an NBC News poll in February, Biden and Trump are tied among Latinos, a constituency that has traditionally voted for Democrats. But Biden won the critical demographic 65% to 32% in 2020, according to exit polls. Unless he can get somewhere near that percentage again, key swing states in the West like Arizona and Nevada could be out of his reach and even competitive states further east that he also won four years ago, like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where there are smaller Hispanic populations, could be at risk. Biden\u2019s character attacks on Trump represent his best attempt to remind Americans of the fateful nature of the choice they will face in November. Those hits would be remarkable enough if the presumptive GOP nominee were a neophyte candidate who could be easily defined by negative advertising. But most voters already know exactly who Trump is. So, the finely balanced contest poses a question with which Democrats might prefer not to wrestle: What if enough persuadable voters are fully familiar with Trump\u2019s past and remember the mayhem and division of his White House term \u2013 but still aren\u2019t ready to support Biden?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/biden-trump-character-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_supreme-court-what-to-watch-trump-immunity-abortion-guns", "text": "The Supreme Court is turning toward the final, frenzied days of its term, readying potential blockbuster decisions on abortion, guns and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity. The court will hand down opinions on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week as the justices aim to finish their work by the last day in June. The decisions will land rapidly at a tense time for the 6-3 conservative-liberal court \u2013 just before a historic presidential election that has been heavily influenced by its decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade. Public opinion of the court remains at record lows. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, has faced sharp blowback over two controversial flags raised at his homes in Virginia and New Jersey. Here are some of the remaining cases to be decided this week. Trump claims \u2018absolute\u2019 immunity Trump\u2019s appeal for immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges landed at the Supreme Court late in the term and instantly overshadowed most of the docket. Trump argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April, though it didn\u2019t appear Trump would be able to get Smith\u2019s case tossed entirely. The immunity case, appears likely to come down to whether Trump\u2019s post-election actions were \u201cofficial\u201d \u2013 that is, steps he was taking as president \u2013 or whether they were \u201cprivate,\u201d which would not likely receive immunity. An appeals court in Washington sided against Trump. Abortion for health in emergencies The Supreme Court will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion. An Idaho law bars doctors from performing abortions unless the mother\u2019s life is at risk, but it makes no exception if that she would suffer long-term health consequences. The Biden administration argues a federal law requires hospitals to perform abortions if the health of a mother is at stake, and an appeals court agreed. The decision in Moyle v. US will place abortion access on the forefront again this summer just as Americans begin tuning into the presidential election. January 6 rioters seek to shorten sentences A former Pennsylvania police officer who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, challenged federal obstruction charges filed against him in a case that could also affect Trump. The former president was charged with violating the same obstruction law for different reasons. The case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump\u2019s rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer\u2019s attorney told the justices that prosecutors went too far by charging his client with \u201cobstructing\u201d an official proceeding, a crime he said Congress intended to be used to prohibit the destruction of evidence. Some 350 rioters were charged with the crime, which can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence. Some of those charges have since been dropped as part of plea agreements. Prosecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words \u201cobstruct\u201d and \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d covers the attack that interrupted Congress\u2019 counting of ballots to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win. Critics say the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation. Government regulation of Facebook The Supreme Court is confronting a series of cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. Perhaps the most notable are two suits challenging laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views. The state laws ban online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives. Two trade associations representing the social media companies sued, claiming they violated the First Amendment. One federal appeals court in Atlanta sided with the companies and against Florida. Another, in New Orleans, allowed the Texas law to take effect. The Supreme Court paused implementation of the Texas law in 2022. The cases are Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton. Cleaning up online \u2018disinformation\u2019 The justices must decide if the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, or whether those efforts violate the First Amendment. Biden officials have for years tried to persuade social media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things. Republican officials in two states \u2013 Missouri and Louisiana \u2013 and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing the administration did far more than \u201cpersuade\u201d the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. The case is Murthy v. Missouri.  Government regulations threatened A series of cases this term challenge the power of federal agencies to approve regulations \u2013 or enforce them. Among the most significant are two appeals filed by Atlantic herring fishermen. The captains are challenging a Department of Commerce regulation that requires them to pay the salary of federal observers they bring on board to monitor the catch and ensure the crew follows other fishing regulations. The court is being asked to overturn a 1984 precedent \u2013 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2013 that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing Washington has too much control over industry. The justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gives the court an opportunity to take a much broader stroke. Critics fear a ruling for the fishermen would threaten a vast swath of other federal regulations aimed at protecting the environment, public health and workplace safety. The cases are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce. Lower courts sided with the government in both cases. Domestic violence gun law upheld In a significant Second Amendment case, the justices upheld the constitutionality of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion for the 8-1 majority. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was indicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend\u2019s credit card was declined. Rahimi\u2019s lawyers claimed a Supreme Court decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen meant the domestic violence law cannot be squared with the Constitution because it has no historical analogue. A 6-3 majority in Bruen said gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d But the Supreme Court ruled that there were similar historic laws on the books at the time of the nation\u2019s founding that allowed the government to disarm dangerous people. Justice Clarence Thomas penned a solo dissent. Access to abortion pill maintained In another major abortion case, the Supreme Court upheld US Food and Drug Administration efforts to expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone. The unanimous ruling was a significant setback for the anti-abortion movement in what was the first major Supreme Court case on reproductive rights since the conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. By ruling that the anti-abortion doctors don\u2019t have standing to sue, the court left expanded access to the drug in place. Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. Medication abortions account for\u00a0nearly two-thirds of\u00a0all abortions in the US, according to some estimates. The appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who said their practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups have stressed that mifepristone is safe. The lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it sued. The location allowed the group to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to conservative US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Now, the case is expected to return to Kacsmaryk\u2019s court. Though the decision was a win for abortion rights groups, it was not a total victory: Other groups are likely to sue over the same provisions. Three conservative states that intervened in the original lawsuit may attempt to revive it.

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_early-divisions-signal-bitter-internal-conflicts-as-supreme-court-turns-toward-final-decisions", "text": "From a blockbuster Second Amendment decision to a more technical case about retaliatory arrests, sharp disagreements have emerged on the Supreme Court over the reasoning of recent rulings \u2013 divisions that could signal an especially fiery end to the current term. Even as the court is sometimes finding wider-than-expected majorities for relatively limited outcomes, the nine justices are regularly in conflict over the meaning of decisions. The quarreling over doctrine and rationale may partly explain why so many major cases remain before the court\u2019s term is expected to end as soon as Friday. That dynamic was particularly notable last week in a blockbuster decision on guns, which drew eight justices into the majority but five separate concurrences bickering over the court\u2019s methodology. A number of lower-profile cases have also sparked deep doctrinal divisions, even when the final vote count is lopsided. \u201cIt does seem, at least anecdotally, unusual to have this many separate opinions in cases with relatively lower stakes,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cOnly the justices know why, but it certainly at least suggests that the court is having trouble reaching consensus, even in contexts in which historically it was better able to do so.\u201d In an important ruling last week dealing with a Trump-era repatriation tax, several justices dinged the majority for not answering the question the court initially agreed to resolve. Meanwhile, in a decision about a former city councilwoman who claimed she was wrongly arrested, Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared to be so exasperated that he wrote the judicial equivalent of a shrug emoji into a concurrence.\u00a0 \u201cWe are where we are,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote, adding that the court\u2019s decision to grant the case seemed, in retrospect, \u201cill-advised.\u201d The court is rounding out a contentious term with more than a dozen cases still outstanding, including those dealing with emergency abortions, the power of federal agencies to approve regulations and whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. Additional opinions are expected Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. So far, the court has handed down five decisions in which the vote split along ideological lines, with the six conservatives lining up in the majority against the three liberals. That\u2019s the same number of 6-3 ideological outcomes as the entire 2022-2023 term. The Supreme Court earlier this month tossed out an appeal from anti-abortion doctors challenging expanded access to the abortion pill mifepristone. In March, it ruled that states couldn\u2019t yank Trump off presidential ballots because of his actions before the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. On Friday, the court upheld a federal law barring Americans who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns. While those decisions and others have put conservative and liberal justices together in majorities, they also have drawn especially sharp concurrences, including some that at times have read strikingly like dissents. Disagreements among Trump nominees Seven justices joined the court\u2019s bottom-line conclusion on Thursday in Moore v. US to uphold a Trump-era tax levied on shareholders on undistributed profits accrued between 1986 and the end of 2017 by certain foreign corporations. But Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito declined to join the majority opinion by Kavanaugh. Instead, they wrote separately to pick apart his approach. \u201cI think the issue is more complex than the court lets on,\u201d Barrett wrote. The majority\u2019s conclusion \u201cmight be right,\u201d she added, but its \u201creasons for saying so are wrong.\u201d The Supreme Court is working at a remarkably slow pace this year given its relatively small case load, said Aziz Huq, a University of Chicago law professor. But, Huq said, \u201cthis hasn\u2019t led to more clarity in the law.\u201d \u201cIt is striking that there\u2019s so much disagreement,\u201d he said. \u201cCases such as Moore illustrate this, which divided the justices in a quite extraordinary way.\u201d In last week\u2019s Second Amendment decision, seven justices joined Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion upholding the law intended to protect the victims of domestic violence. But the opinion also prompted five separate concurring opinions, including from the three conservative justices nominated by Trump. Those concurrences exposed deep divisions over the court\u2019s use of history to determine whether gun laws are constitutional. In a major decision two years ago, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the court\u2019s conservatives ruled that in order to survive constitutional scrutiny, gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition.\u201d In its ruling last week, the court said that a federal law allowing the government to disarm Americans who are the subject of certain domestic violence restraining orders met that standard. Kavanaugh wrote that using history to decide Second Amendment disputes is a far better approach than trying to make judgements about the worth of gun restrictions. A non-historical review, he wrote, is \u201cantithetical to the principle that judges must act like umpires. It turns judges into players.\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch chimed in separately to agree, asserting that there wasn\u2019t anything \u201cremotely unusual\u201d about looking to history to help decide cases. \u201cFaithful adherence to the Constitution\u2019s original meaning may be an imperfect guide, but I can think of no more perfect one for us to follow,\u201d he wrote. But the liberal justices took issue with the conservatives\u2019 position of a history-based approach to the Second Amendment, noting that the nation\u2019s history has often been conflicted and not inclusive. The rule of law, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote, \u201cthrives on legal standards that foster stability, facilitate consistency, and promote predictability. So far, Bruen\u2019s history-focused test ticks none of those boxes.\u201d Alito pushes for more protection of police\u00a0in arrest retaliation case In another decision last week, the court allowed a Texas woman who served on a small-town council to continue a lawsuit against her mayor after she was arrested for what she claims were political reasons. The unsigned opinion technically drew only one public dissent, from Justice Clarence Thomas. But in three concurrences written by both conservatives and liberals, it became clear that the justices were all over the map. Alito wrote a lengthy concurrence taking issue with the fact that the court declined to address one of the key issues raised by the case: Whether there should be a different standard for considering retaliatory arrests when it\u2019s not a snap-judgement made by a police officer. Police are often afforded the benefit of the doubt in the law when they are making potentially life-and-death decisions quickly. In the case of the Texas woman, Sylvia Gonzalez, police had investigated allegations that she stole a document at a public meeting for weeks before arresting her. Alito said the timing shouldn\u2019t have made a difference. But the court\u2019s unsigned opinion declined to weigh into the debate. \u201cThe court today reserves judgment on this issue,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI disagree with this course.\u201d Earlier this month, the court unanimously rejected a political activist\u2019s attempt to trademark the phrase \u201cTrump Too Small,\u201d a reference to a lewd exchange between Trump and Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio during the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Even though all nine justices agreed on the conclusion, six splintered off into concurrences. Among them, Justice Sonia Sotomayor slammed the court\u2019s majority opinion for its reliance on history to decide the trademark dispute. That approach, she said, had allowed the court\u2019s conservatives to choose a version of history that fits their desired outcome, like a person \u201centering a crowded cocktail party and looking over everyone\u2019s heads to find your friends.\u201d \u201cI am reluctant,\u201d she added, \u201cto go further down this precipice of looking for questionable historical analogues to resolve the constitutionality of Congress\u2019s legislation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/early-divisions-signal-bitter-internal-conflicts-as-supreme-court-turns-toward-final-decisions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine", "text": "The Biden administration is moving toward lifting a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine, four\u00a0US officials familiar with the matter told CNN, to\u00a0help the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems. The change\u00a0would\u00a0mark\u00a0another significant shift in the Biden administration\u2019s Ukraine policy, as the US looks for ways to give Ukraine\u2019s military an upper hand against Russia. The policy is still being worked on by administration officials and has not received final sign-off yet from President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden, officials said. \u201cWe have not made any decisions and any discussion of this is premature,\u201d said one administration official. \u201cThe president is absolutely firm that he will not be sending\u00a0US\u00a0troops to Ukraine.\u201d Once approved,\u00a0the change\u00a0would likely be\u00a0enacted this year, officials said, and\u00a0would\u00a0allow the Pentagon to provide contracts to American companies for work inside Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded\u00a0in 2022. Officials said they hope it will speed up the maintenance and repairs of weapons systems being used by the Ukrainian military. Over the last two years, Biden has insisted that all Americans, and particularly US troops, stay far away from the Ukrainian frontlines. The White House has been determined to limit both the danger to Americans and the perception, particularly by Russia, that the US military is engaged in combat there. The State Department has explicitly warned Americans against traveling to Ukraine since 2022. As a result, US-provided military equipment that has sustained significant damage in combat has had to be transported out of the country to Poland, Romania, or other NATO countries for repairs, a process which takes time. \u00a0US troops are also available to help the Ukrainians with more routine maintenance and logistics, but only from afar via video chat or secure phone\u2014an arrangement that has come with inherent limitations, since US troops and contractors are not able to work directly on the systems. Administration officials began to seriously reconsider those restrictions over the last several months, officials said, as Russia continued to make gains on the battlefield and US funding for Ukraine stalled in Congress. Allowing experienced, US government-funded American contractors to maintain a presence in Ukraine means they will be able to help fix damaged, high-value equipment much faster, officials said. One advanced system that officials say will likely require regular maintenance is the F-16 fighter jet, which Ukraine is set to receive later this year. Companies bidding for the contracts would be required to develop\u00a0robust risk mitigation plans to mitigate threats to their employees, an official said. The discussions follow a series\u00a0of decisions the US has made in recent months to try to help Ukraine beat back the Russians. In late-May, Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike targets inside Russia, near the border with the Ukrainian city of\u00a0Kharkiv, with US weapons\u2014a request the US had repeatedly denied in the past. Last week, that policy appeared to expand once again, when National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Ukraine could counterstrike anywhere along the Ukraine-Russia border using US weapons. Current and former officials familiar\u00a0with the discussions\u00a0about deploying\u00a0contractors to Ukraine emphasized that the policy change will not result in the kind of overwhelming American contractor presence there that existed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, it would likely result in anywhere from a few dozen to a couple hundred contractors working in Ukraine at a time. \u201cThis would be a much more focused and thoughtful effort to support Ukraine in country,\u201d said retired Army officer Alex\u00a0Vindman, who served as the director for European Affairs on former President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Council. Vindman\u00a0has been pushing the administration to lift the restrictions for nearly two years and said the administration has been working on a plan to ease the restrictions since earlier this year. \u201cUkraine is an ally,\u201d\u00a0Vindman\u00a0told CNN. \u201cThe US has keen, critical national security interests in supporting Ukraine, and there are plenty of risk mitigation measures.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/biden-administration-american-military-contractors-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "politics"}}
