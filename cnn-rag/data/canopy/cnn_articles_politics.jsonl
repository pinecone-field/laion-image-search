Mitt Romney said that if he were President Joe Biden he would have \u201cimmediately pardoned\u201d former President Donald Trump. \u201cHad I been President Biden, when the Justice Department brought on indictments, I would have immediately pardoned him,\u201d Romney\u00a0told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle\u201d\u00a0in an interview set to air Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019d have pardoned President Trump. Why? Well, because it makes me, President Biden, the big guy and the person I pardoned a little guy.\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,  faces 88 charges\u00a0over four criminal indictments in Georgia; New York; Washington, DC; and Florida \u2014 with the latter two being federal cases prosecuted by Special Counsel Jack Smith. While the longtime Trump critic disagreed with Biden\u2019s handling of the federal cases, Romney also criticized Trump\u2019s attacks on the courts and called out Republicans who are trying to curry favor with the former president amid his hush money trial in Manhattan. The former president, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, has repeated the baseless claim that Biden has weaponized the Justice Department against his 2024 presidential election rival. He has also continuously attacked the judges overseeing his cases, giving rise to security concerns\u00a0with some receiving threats. \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible fault for our country to see people attacking our legal system, that\u2019s an enormous mistake,\u201d Romney stated. Allies of the former president have been flocking to the\u00a0Manhattan criminal courthouse\u00a0to display their support for Trump, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who are both under consideration to be Trump\u2019s running mate. \u201cI think it\u2019s also demeaning for people to quite apparently try and run for vice president by donning a red tie and standing outside the courthouse. It\u2019s just, I\u2019d have felt awkward,\u201d Romney said. The politicians coming to the former president\u2019s defense \u2014 who have also included Florida Reps. Byron Donalds and Cory Mills and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 are attacking the people Trump is barred from publicly speaking about due to a gag order issued by the judge in the ongoing Manhattan hush money trial. Romney has long been a critic of Trump and has often criticized his Republican colleagues for their continued loyalty to the former president. He found Trump\u00a0guilty of abuse of power\u00a0during Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial in the Senate, becoming the first senator in US history to vote to remove from office a president from the same party. And a year later, he voted with six other Republicans to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 during the former president\u2019s second impeachment trial. Romney has said he did not vote for Trump, his party\u2019s nominee, in 2020 and has said he will not vote for him in 2024. The 77-year-old senator as the Republican Party nominee in the 2012 presidential race, losing to Democratic incumbent Barack Obama. Romney, known for his distinctive voice in the Senate as a lawmaker willing to take on his own party, announced last year he would not seek reelection to his seat.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_desantis-bill-climate-change-florida", "text": "As Florida copes with rising seas and record temperatures, lawmakers are going to exceptional lengths to delete many mentions of climate change from state laws in a new bill that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law on Wednesday, according to his official X account. The wide-ranging law makes several changes to the state\u2019s energy policy \u2013 in some cases deleting entire sections of state law that talk about the importance of cutting planet-warming pollution. The bill would also give preferential treatment to natural gas and ban offshore wind energy, even though there are no wind farms planned off Florida\u2019s coast. The bill deletes the phrase \u2018climate\u2019 eight times \u2013 often in reference to reducing the impacts of global climate change through its energy policy or directing state agencies to buy \u2018climate friendly\u2019 products when they are cost-effective and available. The bill also gets rid of a requirement that state-purchased vehicles should be fuel efficient. \u201cFlorida rejects the designs of the left to weaken our energy grid, pursue a radical climate agenda, and promote foreign adversaries,\u201d DeSantis said in a post on X, posting a graphic that said the law would protect the state from \u201cgreen zealots.\u201d \u201cWhat Florida is really doing is saying we\u2019re going to deemphasize any policies that would help mitigate climate change,\u201d said Emily Hammond, a professor of law at George Washington University. It\u2019s certainly not the first time Republican politicians have deleted the phrase \u2018climate change\u2019 \u2013 erasing the phrase from government websites was a commonplace activity during the Trump administration. But experts said few other states have passed bills to move away from clean energy and erase climate mentions from their laws. \u201cIt goes further than any other state has gone in repealing its existing climate laws,\u201d Michael Gerrard, founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told CNN. Last year was the hottest year on record for Florida, breaking yet another heat record in the state. South Florida in particular observed scorching heat index temperatures that reached as high as 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Sea levels have risen as much as eight inches higher than they were in 1950, already leading to increased flooding from storms and tides alike. \u201cFlorida is one of the most vulnerable states in the country,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cAll of South Florida is at great peril from sea level rise. They should be the last state to stand in the way of fighting climate change.\u201d Even as Florida politicians are erasing mentions of climate change from their laws, they are also increasingly focused on helping a storm and flood-prone state withstand climate impacts. DeSantis and state lawmakers have poured over $1.1 billion into increasing community resilience to flooding and storms, according to a 2023 news release from the governor\u2019s office. In 2019, DeSantis appointed the state\u2019s first chief resilience officer Julia Nesheiwat \u2013 who explicitly referenced climate change and sea level rise as a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to the state. (Nesheiwat has since left her post and replaced by the state\u2019s current chief resilience officer Wesley Brooks). Florida has also accepted millions of dollars in federal funding to help reconstruct a state highway in Miami Beach \u2013 elevating the pavement and installing new pump stations to help clear the road of water during flooding events. When it comes to other federal climate and clean energy funding, however, the state hasn\u2019t been eager to accept. DeSantis vetoed over $29 million dollars in federal energy rebates and energy efficiency grants from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Florida was one of five states that declined to compete for $4.6 billion in federal climate grants, although numerous Florida metropolitan areas including Jacksonville, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa have raised their hands for the funding instead. Hammond and Gerrard said this approach from Florida politicians to fund programs dealing with climate impacts without acknowledging its root cause isn\u2019t surprising. Hammond called focusing on adapting to climate change and hardening infrastructure without attribute it to a warming planet \u201cconsistent to the conservative approach.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t want to acknowledge that climate change is happening; they acknowledge they have flooding,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cIf it\u2019s about moving away from fossil fuels, they don\u2019t like it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/desantis-bill-climate-change-florida/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_supreme-court-louisiana-black-voters-congressional-district", "text": "The Supreme Court paused a chaotic legal fight over\u00a0Louisiana\u2019s congressional districts\u00a0in a brief order Wednesday that will likely allow the state to use a map in this year\u2019s election that creates a second majority-Black district and benefits Democrats. The court\u2019s three liberal justices publicly dissented from the decision. In the short term, the decision allows the state to move forward in this year\u2019s election with a map that will make a second of its six districts competitive for Democrats. That could have enormous consequences given the razor-thin majority Republicans have in the US House of Representatives. Louisiana state Sen. Cleo Fields, a Democrat and former member of Congress running in the new Black-majority district crafted by state lawmakers, said the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cwas the outcome that was needed for the state.\u201d \u201cThe people of Louisiana now know what their congressional lines look like,\u201d he told CNN. On that point, at least, Fields and other Democrats in the state were aligned with Republican officials and a group of Black voters who had asked for the court\u2019s intervention. In a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said that she was grateful the Supreme Court ensured \u201da stable election season.\u201d Although Black residents make up roughly a third of Louisiana\u2019s population, the state currently has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its current six-member US House delegation. But the decision may represent something of a pyrrhic\u00a0victory for voting rights groups who fear the court\u2019s justification for allowing the new map could have far-reaching consequences in future redistricting battles. The ruling will have an impact beyond the Louisiana district, which likely explains the vote count, said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck. \u201cThis ruling is a short-term win for Black voters in Louisiana, and, thus, Democrats, but a long-term expansion of a deeply controversial approach to how federal courts handle election-year voting cases \u2013 which is a big part of why the justices seem to all have ended up in unpredictable positions here,\u201d said Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. Purcell principle politics Louisiana officials specifically asked the Supreme Court last week to rely on a legal doctrine\u00a0known as the Purcell principle, which it sometimes invokes to stay out of last-minute election lawsuits. The majority cited Purcell in its brief order Wednesday but did not otherwise explain its reasoning. The Supreme Court has never defined what constitutes a \u201clast-minute\u201d election decision that should bar courts from weighing into such disputes. And the court\u2019s conservatives have faced blowback in recent years for applying that doctrine in a way critics see as inconsistent. Louisiana won\u2019t hold its congressional primary election until November. In a brief dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said it was premature for the Supreme Court to intervene in the case. She said that Purcell \u201chas no role to play here.\u201d \u201cRather than wading in now, I would have let the District Court\u2019s remedial process run its course before considering whether our emergency intervention was warranted,\u201d Jackson wrote. Jackson, in other words, would have waited for the lower courts or the state Legislature to draw a new map. \u201cOne of the biggest criticisms of Purcell is that it\u2019s deeply subjective with regard to how close to an election federal courts should stay their hand,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling only compounds that critique, because it expressly applies it more than five months before an election without any explanation for why. That will make Purcell both broader and more malleable in lower courts going forward.\u201d Case watched for how Supreme Court looks at redistricting and gerrymandering The new district at issue in the case slashes diagonally from Shreveport in the northwest of the state to Baton Rouge in the southeast for some 250 miles to create a district where Black residents make up some 54% of the district\u2019s voters \u2013 up from about 24% under the old lines. The map lawmakers approved carved up the district of Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican who had endorsed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s opponent in last year\u2019s gubernatorial primary. The case has been watched closely by civil rights groups and election experts for its potential national impact. At its most basic level, the proposed map would give Democrats a chance to add a second member to their delegation. But the fight also implicates deeper and more long-standing controversies that could reach beyond the Bayou State, including how the Supreme Court handles similar redistricting cases and how state mapmakers are supposed to consider race as they eke as much political advantage as they can from the boundaries of each district they draw. Louisiana came to the Supreme Court caught between two lower court orders. One court said state lawmakers likely violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing only one majority-Black district out of six. A second court found the state\u2019s attempt to fix the problem with a second majority-Black district was unconstitutional because lawmakers relied on race in a way that violated the equal protection clause. The second map was challenged by a group of voters who have identified themselves in court as \u201cnon-African American,\u201d though the list of plaintiffs includes a number of prominent White Republicans. Those voters argued their \u201cpersonal dignity\u201d was injured because the new map with two majority-Black districts \u201cracially stigmatizes,\u201d \u201cracially stereotypes\u201d and \u201cracially maligns\u201d them. Caught in the middle was a group of Black voters who felt the new map, while imperfect, was at least better than the one used in the 2022 midterm elections that included only a single majority-Black district. Two years ago, the Supreme Court allowed that map to be used in the midterm even though a lower court said it was likely illegal. The Black voters and Republican Louisiana officials both urged the Supreme Court to step in and pause the lower court proceedings \u2013 arguing the state needed an answer on which map to use by today. But the White voters said there was plenty of time for the state legislature or the lower court to draw a new map. \u201cOur fight for a fair congressional map has carried on for years,\u201d\u00a0Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cToday, we celebrate our communities\u2019 opportunity to have a voice in this year\u2019s elections, that can lead to the representation we need to make positive change in the years ahead. This is a day for hope.\u201d The attorneys for the voters who challenged the map with the two Black-majority districts said they are confident they ultimately will prevail if the Supreme Court agrees to hear an appeal on the merits of the case. \u201cThe state of Louisiana enacted a brutal racial gerrymander that segregates its voters based on their race,\u201d Edward Greim and Paul Hurd said in a joint statement. \u201cAs a result, their constituents may well vote in November 2024 districts segregated by race.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/supreme-court-louisiana-black-voters-congressional-district/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing more critical moments this week that will test his fraught relationship with his base over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and potentially widen the partisan split about the Jewish state that has been building for years. Long before the current conflict, polls showed that sympathies among rank-and-file Democrats have been shifting from Israel toward the Palestinians over roughly the past two decades\u00a0\u2014 a period that coincides with almost unbroken right-leaning governments in Israel, mostly led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Simultaneously, support for Israel over that same long period has markedly increased among rank-and-file Republican voters. As a result, over twice as many Republican as Democratic voters now say they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, a much bigger gap between the parties than earlier in this century, according to Gallup Organization polling. This widening partisan chasm in the United States suggests that whenever Netanyahu leaves the political stage in Israel, an inescapable part of his legacy will be a leading role in shattering the bipartisan consensus that for decades provided Israel an almost unassailable position in US politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the drivers of the US-Israeli relationship that have accounted for its resilience, its special quality and character over the years, are more under stress than at any point in my government experience or even out of government,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has advised six secretaries of state on the Mideast. That rising pressure could make Biden the last of his kind: Though the vast majority of Democratic office-holders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. He\u2019s expected to make a speech on antisemitism on Tuesday at an event sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Meanwhile, Democratic critics of his handling of the war will be watching on Wednesday when his administration is due to report to Congress on whether Israel is using US weapons in accordance with international law and is cooperating with the delivery of humanitarian aid. Biden\u2019s deep personal bond with Israel already makes him a throwback in US politics. In the first half century after Israel\u2019s formation in 1948, it was Democratic presidents such as Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton who displayed the greatest emotional connection to the Jewish state. Republican presidents including Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also supported Israel but more overtly qualified that support when it conflicted with their other regional goals of preserving access to oil and repelling Soviet influence; Reagan and Bush each at points protested Israeli actions they opposed by temporarily withholding aid. Over roughly the past quarter century this partisan pattern has inverted. Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump have identified most thoroughly with Israel, while Clinton (in his second term) and Barack Obama experienced the most disagreements with the Israeli government. Many factors have contributed to this reversal of roles. Bush\u2019s campaign against Islamic extremism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks encouraged him to place more value on Israel as a regional ally. Growing identification with Israel among US White evangelical Christians, a key GOP constituency, also nudged the party toward greater support for the Jewish state. Conversely, more voters in the Democratic coalition (both racial minorities and liberal Whites) came to see Israel\u2019s treatment of the occupied Palestinian territories as colonial, or even apartheid-type, oppression. While holding the prime minister position in the late 1990s and then again with only brief interruption since 2009, Netanyahu has also played a huge personal role in prompting this American partisan reversal. Netanyahu has pursued staunchly conservative policies within Israel (such as his attempt to weaken the judiciary that triggered massive nationwide protest) and rebuffed pressure from successive Democratic presidents to negotiate an independent Palestinian state. As important, he has aligned with the Republican Party as overtly as any foreign leader has with either political party in modern times. Netanyahu in 2015, for instance, delivered a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal at the invitation of House Republicans \u2014 over express objections from Obama. And Netanyahu recently echoed Republican talking points at a news conference when he dismissed the protests about the war on US campuses as simply widespread antisemitism. Against this backdrop, partisan polarization about Israel among American voters was already widening years before the brutal Hamas attack last October and the devastating Israeli response it triggered. One measure is the annual Gallup polls that ask Americans whether they sympathize mostly with Israel or mostly with the Palestinians. In 2001, the share of Republican voters who said they sympathized mostly with Israel exceeded the share of Democrats by only eight percentage points (59% vs. 51%.) By Obama\u2019s second term, Republican partisans were over 20 points more likely than Democrats to say they sympathized mostly with Israel. The gap between the parties in sympathy for Israel expanded under Trump to nearly 40 points, and it has soared to 45 points under Biden \u2014 nearly six times the difference in 2001. In the 2023 and 2024 surveys, Gallup recorded for the first time that the share of Democrats who sympathized mostly with the Palestinians exceeded the share who mostly favored Israel. Another long-running survey series from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found similar, though not quite as extensive, movement. In 2002, the share of Republicans who said the US should take Israel\u2019s side in the conflict was roughly double the percentage of Democrats; in the latest survey, \u00a0conducted this February, the gap had grown to about 3-to-1. The survey found that the share of Democrats who said the US should align with Israel in the conflict, after falling through the Trump years, rebounded to nearly 1-in-5 in the latest poll, almost exactly its level in the early 2000s. But as many Democrats now say the US should side with the Palestinians \u2013 a view held by just 1-in-50 Democrats in 2002. (That\u2019s also the same share of Republicans today\u00a0 who say the US should side with the Palestinians.) Most Democrats said the US should not take either side in the conflict \u2014 a view shared by only about two-fifths of Republicans. An array of polls this spring show how the war in Gaza has hardened this partisan split. \u00a0Earlier this year, both Quinnipiac University and CBS/YouGov polls found that while about 55% of Republicans wanted the US to send more military aid to Israel, about two-thirds of Democrats did not. Nearly half of Democrats, but only a little over one-fifth of Republicans in the CBS poll, said the US should pressure Israel to stop the fighting. While a slim majority of Republicans expressed confidence in Netanyahu in an April Pew survey, over 7-in-10 Democrats said they had little or no faith in the Israeli leader \u201dto do the right thing.\u201d In the Quinnipiac survey just 5% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu; the number was 11 times as high among Republicans. All of the dividing lines separating the parties are also cleaving the generations. Just 1-in-12 young adults in the Quinnipiac poll said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu and over two-thirds opposed sending more arms to Israel; likewise, in the Pew survey about two-thirds of young adults said they viewed the Israeli government unfavorably. Gallup\u2019s latest poll found that while older adults still mostly favor Israel, a plurality of younger adults now express sympathy for the Palestinians. These shifts in attitudes within the Democratic coalition have only modestly changed behavior among the party\u2019s leading elected officials. Only 37 House Democrats ultimately voted against the recently approved foreign aid package that included over $26 billion in new military assistance to Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite an earlier speech criticizing Netanyahu, is reportedly joining with House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint congressional session \u2014 an extraordinary opportunity given how many of Biden\u2019s requests Netanyahu has resisted since the war began. Liberal critics of Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians, both before and after the October 7 attacks, largely attribute the widening disconnect between Democratic voters and elected officials to the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other pro-Israeli lobbying groups in Washington. Since the Obama presidency, AIPAC has become more aggressive in supporting primary campaigns against Democratic officials critical of Israel; it has pledged to spend $100 million this year to defeat members of Congress who have criticized Israel\u2019s conduct of the war most strongly such as Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. \u201cAIPAC\u2019s enormous financial and political pressure in Washington is the most important factor in slowing down larger numbers of Democratic officials from opposing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, who has held senior positions in multiple liberal organizations and has been active in organizing opposition to the war. \u201cBy targeting Democrats who oppose a blank check of weapons funding to Israel, AIPAC aims to stall an inevitable generational shift within the party.\u201d Yet AIPAC\u2019s influence alone doesn\u2019t explain the distance opening between Democratic voters and officials. Part of the answer, as Shahid suggests, is generational. Biden personifies an older cohort of US political leaders whose image of Israel was formed when it was a lonely outpost of democracy and haven for Holocaust survivors. Ordinary Americans and US political leaders alike in the years of the 1967 and Yom Kippur (1973) wars tended to view Israel, in Miller\u2019s words, as a David barely fending off threatening Goliaths; now, many younger Democrats in particular believe \u201cIsrael is no longer David, it\u2019s Goliath,\u201d and it \u201cis pounding David\u201d in Gaza, Miller said. Older Democratic officials have been less influenced than younger ones by the emergence of that new perspective among their voters. Many observers also note that Biden tends to view foreign policy much as he does domestic politics \u2014 placing enormous confidence in his ability to leverage personal relationships with other leaders. \u201cBiden always says \u2018all foreign policy is an extension of personal relationships,\u2019\u201d said Ben Rhodes, who served as a senior National Security Council adviser while Biden served as Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I heard him say that.\u201d Biden over the course of the war has more explicitly criticized Netanyahu and the far-right coalition that he is governing with, but he has still rebuffed rising demands within Democratic ranks to penalize Israel for its conduct of the war and resistance to the delivery of humanitarian aid. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the seventh month of this war, and this administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on this Israeli government that normal humans would regard as serious or significant pressure,\u201d said Miller. Instead, Miller added, Biden is still operating primarily from the belief that to achieve his goals in the region \u2014 more humanitarian aid into Gaza, a ceasefire that leads to further hostage releases and eventually a regional accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201che cannot do that by creating a sustained public breach with the Israeli prime minister. He needs Israel\u2019s acquiescence if not its active assistance.\u201d Biden allies also believe Israel\u2019s critics within the party are overstating the political risks of his continued support. Though polls show widespread opposition to the war among both young people and Democrats more broadly, they also usually show that those voters prioritize other issues more. \u201cWhile some elements of the party\u2019s activist core are focused on what\u2019s happening in Gaza, most Democrats and most Americans are not,\u201d said long-time Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a pro-Israeli group. \u201cRather they are seized with other issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s holding down prices or protecting abortion rights or protecting democracy itself. \u201c But as the war persists \u2014 with the wave of campus protests compounding the fractures over the issue in the Democratic coalition \u2014 there are clear signs the party\u2019s center of gravity is moving away from the instinctive support for Israel expressed by older Democrats such as Biden and Schumer. The telltale sign is not the escalating outrage over the war from liberals long critical of Netanyahu and far-right Israeli governments, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House. Rather the key measure is the willingness of ambitious mid-career Democrats closer to the party center to criticize Israel\u2019s conduct of the war more openly and to indicate support for limiting the future transfer of offensive weapons; the list of Democrats in that camp include Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Biden only agreed to deliver the report due Wednesday on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and cooperation with international aid after pressure from a group of about 20 Democratic senators led by Van Hollen. Though almost all Democratic senators voted for the recent military aid package for Israel, Biden risks alienating many who supported the assistance if Wednesday\u2019s report to Congress does not seriously address whether Israel should be penalized for its actions in the war, said Amanda Klasing, the national director of government relations and advocacy for Amnesty International. Amnesty recently issued a report charging that Israel has targeted civilians with US weapons in violation of international law. \u201cBiden has a Democratic caucus that is putting a lot of faith in this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have taken these votes under the assumption that these conditions will be applied by the administration.\u201d The Israeli prime minister\u2019s personal relationship with Trump is prickly, but Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach toward both the Palestinians and Iran has encouraged the GOP\u2019s transformation into what Miller calls \u201cthe Israel can do no wrong party.\u201d If Israel elects a more centrist government in the future, Miller believes, the widening US partisan divide over Israel could narrow. But given the alienation about Israeli actions among Democratic partisans in general \u2014 and younger voters in particular \u2014 it seems virtually guaranteed that Democratic elected officials in the years ahead will face greater pressure than Republicans to maintain a critical distance from Israel. So far, Biden has been much more inclined to resist than respond to that pressure. A ceasefire could diffuse that pressure for a time. But even Biden may not be able to ignore the inevitable backlash among Democrats if Netanyahu, with or without a cease fire, eventually fulfills his pledge to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. The fierce Israeli response to the terrorist attacks of October 7 may leave in rubble not just much of Gaza, but the US tradition of bipartisan support for Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_what-to-know-history-of-presidential-debates", "text": "The decisions by President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday to agree to two presidential debates will ensure the continuation of a tradition that dates back to 1960. But it might look a little different this year: the candidates will first debate on June 27 on CNN, months ahead of the usual fall matchups, in events that will not be organized by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has overseen debates in every US presidential election cycle since 1988. It\u2019s just the latest evolution in the history of US presidential debates. A tradition that dates back to 1960 The first televised presidential debates, between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon in 1960, occurred in television studios with no live audience present. Debates did not take place again until the 1976 election, and from then on, took place in front of live audiences that were instructed to not make noise aside from the beginning and ends of the debate. \u201cIn\u00a0\u201976,\u00a0the president was Gerald Ford. He had come into office because of Nixon\u2019s resignation. So he was in kind of a weak position. He\u2019s the one that actually challenged Jimmy Carter to debates, and that set in place this tradition that has existed ever since then of presidential debates,\u201d Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University,\u00a0previously told CNN\u2019s Zachary B.

The importance of the presidential debates is, well, debatable: many credit Kennedy\u2019s narrow victory in 1960 with an appealing performance in the televised debate. Then-President Gerald Ford may have cost himself reelection when he fumbled a question about Soviet military strength in Eastern Europe in 1976. Ronald Reagan, formerly a professional actor, used strong debate performances against Democrats Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale to help secure two election victories, and an ill-advised decision to look at his watch in the 1992 debate became a memorable footnote in President George H.W. Bush\u2019s defeat that year against Bill Clinton. On the other hand, in an era of increasing partisan divides, it\u2019s unclear how many minds are left to be made up. Either way, the debates are likely to present the candidates with some of their best opportunities to reach millions of Americans: around\u00a073 million people\u00a0watched the first debate between Trump and Biden in 2020, when it was broadcast on 16 channels. Many more probably watched online or encountered snippets. A record 84 million watched the first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. This year\u2019s schedule The debates between Biden and Trump will be a historically early and will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. Wednesday morning, both campaigns announced that they had accepted CNN\u2019s invitation for a debate on June 27 and later revealed that they had agreed to debate on ABC on September 10. The debates will be hosted by news organizations rather than the Commission on Presidential Debates, from which the Republican National Committee withdrew its participation in 2022, citing concerns over what it said were biased moderators and debates that were too late in the election calendar in an age of increasingly early voting. Despite the RNC\u2019s withdrawal, the commission\u00a0announced\u00a0dates for three presidential debates last November: a first debate scheduled for September 16 in Texas, a second on October 1 in Virginia and a third on October 9 in Utah. In a letter on Wednesday explaining the campaign\u2019s decision to not participate in the commission\u2019s 2024 debates, Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said the campaign proposed an altered schedule because the original dates are \u201cout of step with changes with changes in the structure of our elections and the interests of voters,\u201d pointing to the timeline of early voting, the way the commission has built debates as an \u201centertainment spectacle\u201d and the commission being \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to enforce rules in 2020 debates. The CNN debate will be held without a studio audience, satisfying a condition outlined by the Biden campaign. It\u2019s a sharp departure from previous events that were often interrupted by responses from audience members. In addition to the two debates that were agreed upon on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s team also called for the candidates to participate in two additional ones in July and August, twice the number requested by Biden. The Biden campaign sidestepped questions about that request on Wednesday. Biden and Trump will likely be the only candidates on stage Biden and Trump have been their party\u2019s presumptive nominees for months despite each state\u2019s primaries continuing to take place. It\u2019s likely, though not yet certain, that the stage will feature only the two men and not include Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who, per CNN\u2019s qualifications for participation on Wednesday, is not yet on enough states\u2019 ballots to meet the 270 electoral vote threshold necessary to be elected president and has not maintained a minimal 15% polling average in major polls recently. Kennedy, who has repeatedly sought to debate Biden and Trump, did not take Wednesday\u2019s announcements well, accusing the two major candidates of \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the stage. In the commission era, the only non-major-party candidate to take part in debates was Ross Perot in 1992. Perot was not included when he ran again in 1996. CNN\u2019s Zachary B.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_mike-johnson-donald-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is not waiting for ex-President Donald Trump to be judged by a jury of his peers. He\u2019s delivered his verdict already. The top Republican in the legislative branch showed up Tuesday at the courthouse where the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is on trial, deploying his authority and the symbolic weight of his office against the justice system. \u201cThe people are losing faith, right now, in this country, in our institutions,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said outside the building where Trump is facing accusations of falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payoff to a former adult film star before the 2016 election. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.) Johnson said Americans were \u201closing faith in our system of justice. And the reason for that is because they see it being abused as it is being done here in New York.\u201d As the trial reached its pivotal moment this week with the testimony of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen, Trump has been gathering high-profile Republicans at the courthouse \u2013 some of whom are auditioning for his vice-presidential spot. On Monday, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a possible VP contender, was there along with Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a famed former college football coach. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, also a possibility for the GOP ticket, showed up Tuesday and dismissed the proceedings as a \u201cpaperwork trial.\u201d It\u2019s a testimony to Trump\u2019s power in the party and command over its grassroots supporters that so many top GOP figures want to be seen supporting him despite his four criminal indictments. Even if this hush money case may be the weakest of them, and even if he\u2019s acquitted, it\u2019s resurfacing details of an alleged liaison with Stormy Daniels and airing testimony about his behavior that paints a grim character sketch. (Trump has denied the affair with Daniels.) These Republicans\u2019 desperation to move into the former president\u2019s inner circle is also ironic since Cohen has offered a cautionary tale in describing how he turned himself into a bullying, lying clone of Trump to grab a piece of his power and reflected glory. His efforts ended \u2013 as with many of Trump\u2019s associates \u2013 in shame and landed him on the wrong side of the law as he went to prison partly because of his role in the hush money cover-up. But Johnson is not just some rising GOP lawmaker \u2013 although he may owe Trump his job after fighting off an attempt to unseat him in which the ex-president declined to play a role. The speaker\u2019s appearance is different, given the constitutional heft of his office and the figurative connotations it evokes. \u201cThese are politically motivated trials, and they are a disgrace,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday. \u201cIt is election interference,\u201d he said, claiming the indictments show how \u201cdesperate\u201d Trump\u2019s opponents are, adopting the former president\u2019s campaign trope that he\u2019s a persecuted political victim. There are legitimate questions about this case \u2013 some of which were being teased out in court as Johnson spoke Tuesday \u2013 including whether the alleged offense arises to the level of a felony. Cohen, a convicted felon, is, to put it mildly, a problematic witness. Some experts have questioned whether any other defendant besides Trump would face the same indictment at the hands of a prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. The theory that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to a conspiracy to interfere in an election might be provable in court but may strike many voters as a stretch, especially during an election eight years later. And then there\u2019s the deeper question of prosecutorial discretion \u2013 whether the gravity of the alleged offenses is sufficient to take the unprecedented and politically radioactive step of putting a former president on trial as he seeks the office again. But Trump is hardly a victim. He is fully availing himself of the protections of the legal system he frequently lambasts. His appeals in other cases, for instance, mean this may be the only one of four trials he faces before the election. That means he\u2019s unlikely to face justice for seeking to overturn one election before standing in the next one. And his charges in this case were not just dreamed up \u2013 they emerged from a grand jury that decided there was a case to answer. Trump is exercising his right to mount a defense and is considered innocent until proven guilty. Johnson, however, claimed the trial was an attempt to destroy Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and prejudged the verdict in lashing out at a \u201csham\u201d trial. He attacked the judge and his partial gag order imposed on Trump to protect the safety of witnesses and sought to discredit the testimony of Cohen. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that he presents here that should be given any weight at all by a jury and certainly not this judge,\u201d Johnson said of the star witness. In seeking to discredit the case and a potential guilty verdict, Johnson is implicitly questioning whether courts should have the power to judge politicians \u2013 a position that, if adopted, would erode a legal system based on the principle that everyone, even ex-presidents, is equal under the law. Johnson\u2019s embrace of Trump is a sign that the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s transgressions \u2013 including his two impeachments, his attempt to destroy democracy to stay in office, his three other indictments, his vows to use a second term to weaponize presidential power against political enemies and to start mass deportations of undocumented migrants, as well as his embrace of rhetoric that echoes 1930s dictators \u2013 are no impediment to a party that craves a return to full power. And the speaker\u2019s willingness to put the symbolism of the legislative branch of government at the service of a strongman who again wants to head the executive branch shows there would be even fewer constitutional restraints on Trump than there were in his first term if Republicans triumph in November\u2019s election.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/mike-johnson-donald-trump-hush-money-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The Biden campaign informed CBS News it had accepted the network\u2019s invitation to participate in a vice presidential debate in studio on either of the two dates the outlet proposed, July 23 or August 13, the campaign official said. \u201cWe look forward to the Trump campaign accepting one of these dates so that the full debate calendar for this campaign can be set,\u201d the official added. The proposed date of July 23 would come less than a week after the conclusion of the Republican convention\u00a0in Milwaukee, giving Trump\u2019s running mate limited time to prepare for a debate with Harris. CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign about whether it would agree for his running mate to participate. On Wednesday,\u00a0President Joe Biden and Trump accepted an invitation from\u00a0CNN to debate on June 27,\u00a0a historically early showdown that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. They have also agreed to\u00a0a debate on ABC News on September 10. Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates had taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions previously told CNN. For millions of Americans, the debates will represent the most extensive scrutiny they\u2019ll be able to give the candidates and their running mates since the debates leading up to the 2020 election.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_house-israel-weapons-bill-vote", "text": "The House voted on Thursday to pass a GOP-led bill\u00a0to compel the delivery of defensive weapons to Israel as Republicans ramp up pressure on President Joe Biden over his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.  The bill would prevent Biden from\u00a0withholding, halting, reversing or canceling weapons transfers that have been approved by Congress from the United States to Israel, and requires any that have been withheld to be delivered to Israel within 15 days of the bill\u2019s enactment. It is unlikely to be taken up in the Democratic-led Senate and the White\u00a0House\u00a0has said that Biden would veto the bill if Congress passed it. The House vote was 224 to 187. Three Republicans voted against the measure and 16 Democrats voted for it. The legislation would cut off funds from\u00a0several key executive-branch entities, including the State Department, the Defense Department and the National Security Council until\u00a0any withheld weapons are sent to Israel.  The vote\u00a0comes\u00a0as\u00a0Biden has faced pushback from lawmakers in both parties\u00a0after he said during an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett last week that he would\u00a0halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel\u00a0if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu orders a major invasion of the city of Rafah, where more than a million civilians have been sheltering. Biden said while the US would continue to provide defensive weapons to Israel, including for its Iron Dome air defense system, other shipments would end should a major ground invasion of Rafah begin. The Biden administration on Tuesday began the early stages of a process to move ahead with a new $1 billion arms deal for Israel, according to two congressional sources. The move comes as the Biden administration has paused the shipment\u00a0of 2,000-pound bombs and 500-pound bombs to Israel, citing opposition to the weapons being used in the densely populated areas of Rafah. House Democratic leaders were whipping their caucus to vote no on the GOP bill, saying in a notice sent to offices that it \u201cwould constitute an unprecedented limitation on President Biden\u2019s executive authority and administrative discretion to implement US foreign policy.\u201d The president\u2019s announcement that he was prepared to condition American\u00a0military aid\u00a0on Israel\u2019s actions amounted to a turning point in the seven-month conflict between Israel and Hamas.\u00a0\u00a0Biden has come under extraordinary pressure, including from some members of his own party, to limit shipments of arms amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Biden administration\u00a0has assessed\u00a0that Israel has amassed enough troops on the edge of Rafah\u00a0to move forward with a full-scale incursion, but senior US officials are unsure whether it has made a final decision to carry out such a move in direct defiance of\u00a0Biden, two senior administration officials have told CNN. The House legislation also includes language condemning the\u00a0Biden\u00a0administration\u2019s \u201cdecision to pause certain arms transfers to Israel\u201d and calling for \u201call previously approved arms transfers to Israel to proceed quickly.\u201d Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on the bill, \u201cThe Biden Administration\u2019s policy and support of Israel has been ironclad and clear from Day One\u2014Israel has the right to defend itself in the face of the existential threat that Hamas poses.\u201d Smith went on to say that the bill \u201cis a blunt instrument that would have significant national security impacts.\u201d \u201cBy prohibiting the President\u2019s ability to make foreign policy decisions regarding pauses in weapons transfers, in this case to Israel, it would set a \u2018carte blanche\u2019 precedent\u2014removing checks, oversight, and accountability for arms sales. To do so would be tantamount to writing a blank check to unconditionally send weapons, something we cannot do no matter how close an ally or friend.\u201d CNN\u2019s Haley Talbot, Kevin Liptak and Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/house-israel-weapons-bill-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_03_11_politics_hur-report-investigation-what-matters", "text": "Special counsel Robert Hur, who spent a year investigating the discovery of classified material at President Joe Biden\u2019s former office and Delaware home, is back in the news. The White House, citing executive privilege, has refused to hand over to House Republicans recordings of Biden talking with Hur as well as with his ghostwriter. Transcripts of Biden\u2019s deposition by Hur have already been released. Still, Republicans on Capitol Hill are moving to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas for the recordings. Hur\u2019s key recommendation \u2013 that Biden not be prosecuted for his handling of material when he was a private citizen \u2013 was overshadowed when Hur released his report in February because the special counsel described the president as a sympathetic elderly man with memory problems. Biden fired back against Hur\u2019s note that he was not charged in part because a jury could potentially see him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d \u201cI am well-meaning. And I\u2019m an elderly man. And I know what the hell I\u2019m doing,\u201d Biden said. Here\u2019s more on Hur, his report and the fallout: Who is Robert Hur? Hur was appointed by then-President Donald Trump as US attorney in Maryland in 2017. During his tenure as a federal prosecutor, which ended in 2021, he prosecuted Baltimore\u2019s then-mayor, Catherine Pugh, in a scandal involving sales of her children\u2019s book. In 2023, Hur was brought back from private practice and appointed to investigate the discovery of classified material at Biden\u2019s former office and Delaware home by Garland. The selection of a Trump-appointed former US attorney was meant to help inoculate the inquiry from allegations of political influence. What did Hur find? Hur issued a 345-page report in February, 15 months after classified material was first found in Biden\u2019s former office. Although investigators found material with classified markings and classified material within Biden\u2019s private notebooks, Hur concluded the \u201cevidence is not strong enough to establish Mr. Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d When did all of this happen? For context, the material was first found in Biden\u2019s office at a time when the handling of classified material was very much in the news because of Trump\u2019s refusal to return classified material to the National Archives. The timeline goes something like this: August 2022: FBI searches Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Florida estate, as part of its yearslong effort to reclaim classified material that had been taken from the White House by the former president. September 2022: Speaking on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Biden responds to the Trump classified documents scandal and wonders \u201chow anyone can be that irresponsible.\u201d These words will not age well. November 2022: Classified material is discovered at the president\u2019s Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement office, a Washington, DC, think tank where Biden spent time after eight years in the Obama administration. The FBI opens an investigation one week later. Later that month, Jack Smith is appointed as special counsel to oversee multiple Trump-related investigations, including the one regarding classified documents. December 2022: Biden\u2019s personal lawyers find more classified material in his Delaware garage and inform the FBI, which dispatches agents, but does not complete a comprehensive search. January 2023: Additional classified documents are discovered in Biden\u2019s Delaware home by his lawyers. CNN first reports on the discovery of material at Penn Biden Center. Hur is appointed as special counsel. He\u2019ll spend the next year conducting his investigation, which includes interviews with 147 witnesses, including Biden. How was the material first discovered? Biden\u2019s personal lawyers found it. As part of an effort to move material out of the Penn Biden Center, one of his personal attorneys looked through boxes of documents found in a closet. One box included an envelope that read \u201cEyes Only\u201d for the vice president. The word \u201cIran\u201d was written on the front. Biden\u2019s lawyers called the White House counsel\u2019s office, which called the National Archives. Within a week, the FBI had opened an investigation. What kind of classified material did Biden have? Most of what Hur describes has to do with US policy toward Afghanistan. Biden, as vice president, was opposed to a surge of US troops into Afghanistan in 2009. Former President Barack Obama decided to go forward with the surge anyway. Biden wrote a memo to Obama in 2009 arguing against the surge, and both the memo and material with classified markings related to the surge were found by the FBI in an unsecured box in Biden\u2019s Delaware garage and in his home office. Separately, investigators found notebooks with classified material in Biden\u2019s handwriting in his Delaware home office and den. Is that all the classified material? No. Additional classified material was found in November 2022 in Biden\u2019s office near the Capitol building at the Penn Biden Center. It was actually the discovery of this material that initially set off a search for classified documents in Biden\u2019s home. There is not as much detail in Hur\u2019s report on these documents, which total 44 pages sprinkled in boxes with nonclassified documents on everything from a 2011 ski trip to the Biden family genealogy. Some documents are concerned with the Obama-era agreement to limit Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Others had to do with a phone call between Biden and Ukraine\u2019s prime minister at the time, as well as US policy in Iraq. Did Biden know that he had classified material? That\u2019s a key question since it is the \u201cwillful\u201d mishandling of classified material as a former vice president for which Biden could have been prosecuted. Much of the classified material is in the form of handwritten notecards and notebooks, although Hur cites the actions of previous presidents, including Ronald Reagan, to say that Biden could \u201cargue plausibly\u201d he thought he had the ability to keep such things in his home. While Hur documents one instance in which Biden refers to finding classified material during a conversation with the ghostwriter of one of his memoirs, other times the president skips over reading aloud things he thinks might be classified. But, according to Hur, there are moments when Biden does read nearly verbatim classified material to his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer. How do we know what exactly Biden told his ghostwriter? Zwonitzer recorded and transcribed their conversations. In fact, after he learned of the appointment of Hur as special counsel, Zwonitzer deleted the recordings, although he kept the transcripts and gave them to the FBI. The FBI was ultimately able to retrieve the deleted recordings. Hur considered prosecuting Zwonitzer with obstruction for deleting the recordings but ultimately decided there would not be enough evidence to obtain a conviction. Why did Hur decide not to prosecute Biden? Hur concludes that Biden \u201cwillfully\u201d retained classified material, but also that there is not enough evidence to establish Biden\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There are a variety of reasons for this conclusion. For starters, Hur notes that by quickly notifying the government after the documents were discovered, some jurors would be convinced the president made an innocent mistake. Plus, there are the aforementioned problems with Biden\u2019s memory, both when he was interviewed by the special counsel and during his interactions with Zwonitzer. Hur concludes that even if Department of Justice policies allowed for the prosecution of a sitting president, he would recommend against prosecuting Biden. Why is Trump being prosecuted for mishandling classified data while Biden is not? Hur explains this in his report, arguing there are important distinctions between the two cases and \u201caggravating facts\u201d in the case of Trump. From Hur\u2019s report: Most notably, after being given multiple chances to return classified documents and avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his homes, sat for a voluntary interview. and in other ways cooperated with the investigation. Will that kind of explanation from a special counsel satisfy Republicans who routinely allege a double standard at the Department of Justice? It will not.

{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_house-panels-contempt-garland-biden-audio", "text": "The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to advance contempt proceedings against Attorney General Merrick Garland for his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur. The move is a major escalation in a dispute over the recordings between House Republicans and the executive branch that came after Biden asserted executive privilege over the files. The panel approved a report recommending a contempt of Congress resolution against Garland\u00a0for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena, paving the way for the full House to vote on holding the attorney general in contempt, though it is not clear when that vote could take place. The House Oversight Committee will also take up the issue of contempt for Garland Thursday evening. Republicans have seized on Hur\u2019s description of Biden as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d in his final report, a characterization that Biden has disputed. Republicans say that access to the tapes would provide valuable information beyond what a written transcript can provide, but the Department of Justice has raised questions over whether the House GOP is seeking the audio files solely for political purposes and maintains they have\u00a0distinct privacy concerns to protect. The special counsel report quickly became a political problem for the president, spotlighting an issue that has proven to be intractable for Biden: his age. The White House and Biden\u2019s campaign reacted furiously to Hur\u2019s characterization of the president, launching a fierce defense aimed at beating back the special counsel\u2019s allegations that Biden was forgetful \u2014 particularly on the matter of whether the president recalled the year in which his son died. Republican lawmakers had previously subpoenaed the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews, along with\u00a0his ghostwriter, Mark Zwonitzer,\u00a0and\u00a0other items from Hur\u2019s investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified information. The transcript of the two-day interview between Hur\u2019s team and Biden was released in March ahead of Hur\u2019s testimony before the House Judiciary committee. Hur did not recommend charges against Biden in his report. Through their subpoenas to the DOJ,\u00a0House\u00a0Republicans have argued that the audio recordings are crucial to their impeachment inquiry into Biden, which remains stalled as the prospects of the investigation ending in impeachment are increasingly unlikely. Without the votes in their narrow majority or evidence of an impeachable offense, Republicans are now struggling with how to end their probe and are looking for ways to\u00a0target other members of the Biden administration. The White House pointed out that the Department of Justice has already provided the transcripts of the special counsel\u2019s interviews with Biden and his ghostwriter, and has complied with the other aspects of the initial subpoena from Republicans. \u201cBecause of the President\u2019s longstanding commitment to protecting the integrity, effectiveness, and independence of the Department of Justice and its law enforcement investigations, he has decided to assert executive privilege over the recordings,\u201d White House Counsel Edward Siskel wrote to House Oversight Chair James Comer and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan. Siskel accused Republicans of wanting to distort the audio recordings and criticized them for going after prosecutors they do not agree with. \u201cThe absence of a legitimate need for the audio recordings lays bare your likely goal \u2014 to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes,\u201d Siskel wrote. In light of the White House asserting executive privilege, the Department of Justice called on House Republicans to cancel their scheduled contempt proceedings. \u201cWith the information you now have, the Committees ought not proceed with contempt and should instead avoid unnecessary and unwarranted conflict,\u201d Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs Carlos Uriarte wrote. Uriarte\u00a0also defended the need to protect the audio tapes:\u00a0\u201cWe have repeatedly made clear that disclosure of the subpoenaed audio recordings would damage future law enforcement efforts and that the Committees\u2019 continued demands raise serious separation of powers concerns.\u201d In April, CNN sued\u00a0for\u00a0access to the recordings of Biden\u2019s interview. Garland denounced Republican-led attacks on the Justice Department in remarks following the announcement that Biden would assert executive privilege. \u201cThe Justice Department is a fundamental institution of our democracy,\u201d Garland told reporters at the Justice Department in Washington, DC. \u201cPeople depend on us to ensure that our investigations and prosecutions are conducted according to the facts and the law and without political influence.\u201d The White House asserted executive privilege at the request of Garland, who wrote to the president on Wednesday. In their contempt reports, Republicans stated that the DOJ does not get to determine what information is useful to their investigation, and\u00a0argued\u00a0that the verbal nuances of an audio recording provide unique insight into a subject that are not reflected in a transcript. \u201cThe Constitution does not permit the executive branch to dictate to Congress how to proceed with an impeachment inquiry or to conduct its oversight,\u201d the report reads. Republicans, meanwhile, argue\u00a0in their report\u00a0that while the transcripts of the interviews reflect what was said, \u201cthey do not reflect important verbal context, such as tone or tenor, or nonverbal context, such as pauses or pace of delivery.\u201d Such pauses and inflections, Republicans claim, \u201ccan provide indications of a witness\u2019s ability to recall events, or whether the individual is intentionally giving evasive or nonresponsive testimony to investigators.\u201d Republicans pointed to a recent example of when a transcript and audio recording of the president diverged,\u00a0stating that\u00a0at a speech last month, Biden read a teleprompter cue out loud during his speech, which was reflected in the recording of the event but not in the initial transcript of his remarks. The House Oversight Committee pushed back the start time of its Thursday markup so that Republican committee members could attend the criminal trial of former President Donald Trump in New York City, two sources familiar with the planning told CNN. When asked to comment on the reason for the schedule change, an Oversight Committee spokeswoman told CNN, \u201cDue to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members\u2019 schedules.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/house-panels-contempt-garland-biden-audio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_nikki-haley-donor-retreat", "text": "More than two months after ending her presidential bid, Nikki Haley did not directly address the topic of Donald Trump\u00a0or her political future\u00a0during a two-day gathering of some of her key donors in Charleston, South Carolina,\u00a0this week.\u00a0Instead,\u00a0the former South Carolina governor\u00a0and her top political aides\u00a0answered\u00a0questions\u00a0about policy\u00a0from those donors and ran through the numbers of how her now-suspended 2024\u00a0campaign raised and spent its money. Since leaving the race, she has kept a relatively low profile, conspicuously refraining from endorsing Trump or encouraging her Republican supporters \u2013 who continue to show up to the primary polls, even with the former president set to win the nomination \u2013\u00a0to oppose him. The donor retreat was one of the biggest signals Haley has given since dropping out of the race that she hopes to keep some presence in national politics.\u00a0The former governor, according to multiple attendees, opted against weighing in on any of the larger questions concerning what comes next for her,\u00a0but she did discuss policy related questions and thank some of her top donors for fueling her campaign. The\u00a0retreat was described as similar to an \u201cinvestor conference,\u201d according to one attendee.\u00a0Haley did not say at any point whether she would endorse Trump, be willing to run as Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee if offered, or run for president in the future, according to multiple attendees of the donor retreat. But those attendees came away from the event with the impression that Haley herself did not have a firm answer to any of those questions. The discussion also veered at one point to Haley backers who are still voting for her in\u00a0the primary even though she\u2019s dropped out of the race.\u00a0On Tuesday night, for example, during the second day of the donor retreat, Trump won the Maryland Republican primary with 80% of the vote;\u00a0 almost 20% of GOP voters chose Haley. Haley didn\u2019t directly say whether she wanted her backers to keep voting for her or to just vote for Trump. She\u2019s deliberately not saying that, one attendee said, but she indicated that she wanted her supporters and attendees at the retreat to \u201cvote your conscience, vote however you want to vote.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s for you to decide,\u201d Haley said, according to one attendee. During the event,\u00a0 Haley did not directly address\u00a0her ongoing support in the primary\u00a0or offer any direct plans about her political future or running again, according to Eric J. Tanenblatt, a top donor who attended the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s made any decisions about her future,\u201d Tanenblatt said. Also during the retreat, longtime Haley adviser Jon Lerner and Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney gave a presentation about how the campaign raised and spent money while the former governor and UN ambassador was running. \u201c[Ankney and Lerner] walked through how the money was spent and how they did what they did. There was obviously a lot of talk about what people would\u00a0like\u00a0her to do. But again she hasn\u2019t made any decisions. I think it\u2019s fair to say, though, that she\u2019s 52 years old, so she\u2019s got some years ahead of her,\u201d Tanenblatt said. Haley also fielded questions from donors on specific issues, including\u00a0abortion, the state of American democracy and the national debt, according to multiple attendees.\u00a0She reiterated her support for Israel in the ongoing war in Gaza when asked during the retreat about the conflict. \u201cWell, she\u2019s been an ardent supporter of Israel and has not wavered at all. Remember at one of the debates when she said \u2018finish them\u2019 referring to Hamas. I think she still feels very strongly about that,\u201d Tanenblatt said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/nikki-haley-donor-retreat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_reports-of-sexual-assaults-in-us-military-drop-for-first-time-in-nearly-a-decade", "text": "Reports of sexual assaults in the\u00a0US\u00a0military dropped for the first time in nearly a decade, according to a new Pentagon report released on Thursday, breaking what had been an upward trend in recent years. A confidential survey also found the number of service members who experienced some type of unwanted sexual contact dropped nearly 20%, a reduction which left the Pentagon \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that its efforts to target sexual assault and harassment\u00a0are beginning to show results. 7,266 service members reported a sexual assault in 2023, a decrease from 7,378 the previous year. Although the change is small, it is the first time the Defense Department has seen a decrease in the number of reports since 2015. Meanwhile, an estimated 29,061 service members experienced some type of unwanted sexual contact, a dramatic decrease from an estimated 35,875 in 2021. These estimates come from a confidential survey conducted every two years to understand the wider prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military. The decrease in the estimated prevalence of unwanted sexual contact was seen across all military services to varying degrees. In a statement after the release of the report, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, \u201cThese early findings are encouraging, and I am grateful for the leadership of many across the Department who have committed the time and made the investments to produce these promising results.\u201d The Pentagon acknowledged it is not completely clear why the numbers decreased. \u201cWhile it\u2019s impossible for us to know exactly why we\u2019re seeing this decrease in sexual assault prevalence, we are cautiously optimistic that the department\u2019s unprecedented investment is having an impact, particularly when it comes to our focus on prevention and building healthy climate,\u201d said Beth Foster, executive director of the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Force Resiliency. Lloyd Austin made tackling what he called the \u201cscourge\u201d of sexual assault one of his top priorities when he came into the Pentagon at the beginning of the Biden administration. In a recorded message for Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, Austin made clear his longstanding position. \u201cThe only acceptable number of sexual assaults is zero,\u201d he said late last month. In 2021, Austin stood up an independent review commission to look at how best to address sexual assault and harassment within the military, ultimately taking major steps that fundamentally change how the military handles such cases. \u201cThat work is starting to bend the curve,\u201d Foster said. As of last December, sexual assault cases are now tried outside the chain of command, a move that critics of the military justice system had long advocated.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_takeaways-trump-trial-michael-cohen-thursday", "text": "Donald Trump attorney Todd Blanche raised his voice and flailed his arms at Michael Cohen, accusing the prosecution\u2019s star witness of making up a phone conversation with Trump just before he sent $130,000 to Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney in October 2016. Blanche confronted Cohen with text messages he sent with Keith Schiller \u2013 whom Cohen had said put Trump on the phone \u2013 which were unrelated to anything having to do with Trump or Daniels. It was the most dramatic moment of the cross-examination of the key witness in the hush money case, and\u00a0the clearest example yet of the defense\u2019s effort to cast doubt on Cohen\u2019s memory of phone calls and other significant interactions with Trump in 2016. Court is off Friday so Trump can attend the high school graduation of his son, Barron. Cross-examination of Cohen will resume Monday and it\u2019s possible summations could begin as soon as Tuesday. Here are the takeaways from Day 18 of the Trump hush money trial: A heated confrontation over a key phone call It took several hours of cross-examination before Blanche finally turned to the evidence directly related to the case. But it didn\u2019t take long for Blanche to make his biggest rhetorical flourish \u2013 and perhaps his biggest blow to Cohen\u2019s credibility \u2013 of the six-hour cross-cross examination so far, focusing on an October 24, 2016, phone call that Trump\u2019s bodyguard placed to Cohen. Under questioning from prosecutors on Monday, Cohen testified that he was reaching out to Schiller to speak to Trump that day because he needed \u201cto discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.\u201d But on Thursday, Blanche read Cohen a text that he sent to Schiller minutes before that call: \u201cWho can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office the dope forgot to block his number.\u201d \u201cCall me,\u201d Blanche said Schiller responded. Blanche says the texts show that at 8:04 p.m. Cohen texted Schiller the phone number of the teenager prank calling him. Blanche used the texts to challenge Cohen\u2019s account of the call. \u201cThat was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump, you talked to Keith Schiller \u2013 you can admit it,\u201d he pressed. Cohen calmly responded, \u201cNo sir, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s accurate.\u201d Cohen said that part of the call was about the prank call, while adding, \u201cI knew that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time and there was more potentially than this.\u201d Blanche began pacing and waving his arms. His voice raised in volume and tone and he began talking quickly: \u201cBut now your memory is you were testifying truthfully on Tuesday. A 1 minute, 36 second phone call and you had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having and also update President Trump about the status of Stormy Daniels\u2019 situation because you had to keep him informed.\u201d \u201cI always ran everything by the boss immediately, and in this case, it would have been saying everything had been taken care of, it\u2019s been resolved,\u201d Cohen responded. Blanche continued to press on Cohen\u2019s memory. \u201cWas it true for just that phone calls, or was it true for other phone calls too?\u201d \u201cYou just said you don\u2019t recall a phone call back in 2016. That is not what you testified to on Tuesday,\u201d Blanche said, his voice crescendoing to a high-pitch just before the lunch break. In the afternoon, Cohen defended his memory of his calls \u2013 arguing that while he\u2019s had thousands of calls and did not remember all of the circumstances surrounding them, he did remember the details of important ones. \u201cBecause these phone calls are things that I have been talking about for the last six years. They are and they were extremely important and they were all-consuming,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSo while I did not know that it took place at 8:02 p.m., what I did recall is the conversation that I had had.\u201d Cohen navigates years of inconsistent statements Trump\u2019s lawyer spent hours tediously moving through inconsistent statements that Cohen has made over the years to knock his credibility, although much of the content he was raising had little to do with the issues on trial. Blanche questioned Cohen on myriad of topics, including the recanting of his 2018 guilty plea on tax charges, whether he wanted to work in the White House and what he\u2019s said about a pardon from Trump. Blanche hammered Cohen with repetitive questions about his 2018 guilty plea, which Cohen has since said was in part a lie under oath. Cohen said he\u2019s taken accountability for the charges like tax fraud that he pleaded guilty to at the time, but he says he still blames others and was the victim of a corrupt prosecution. \u201cYou blame a lot of people over the years for the conduct that you were convicted of?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cI blame people, yes,\u201d Cohen responded. Blanche also challenged Cohen on why federal and state prosecutors never took him on as a cooperator despite his guilty plea to campaign finance charges in connection to the alleged hush money scheme with Daniels. Blanche suggested Cohen was unreliable and only acted like he\u2019d taken accountability for the crimes when he pleaded guilty in order to get a reduced sentence. Cohen pressed on desire for a pardon Blanche also challenged Cohen on his desires to be in Trump\u2019s White House, as revealed in private communications with his daughter and people like Pastor Darrell Scott, who Cohen asked to put in a good word with Trump. Still, Cohen maintained on the stand Thursday that he only ever wanted to be Trump\u2019s personal attorney \u2013 the position he held until he became the subject of a federal investigation. Cohen also conceded on cross-examination that while he testified publicly to Congress that he never asked and would never accept a pardon from Trump, he actually did seek out a pardon from Trump through his attorney and later told lawmakers as much behind closed doors. On the stand, Cohen admitted he explored a pardon with his lawyers because Trump \u201cdangled\u201d the idea of pardoning him and said he \u201cwanted this nightmare to end.\u201d Cohen navigated the confrontation with a cool manner all day but largely told the jury to believe what he says now, not what he\u2019s said in the past, including under oath. Trump perks up for Cohen\u2019s cross For much of the week while Cohen has been on the witness stand, Trump has been taking in the trial with his eyes shut. Trump hardly reacted to Cohen\u2019s testimony during a day-and-a-half of prosecutors\u2019 questions, and he even seemed disinterested during the first half of Blanche\u2019s questioning of him. Trump\u2019s tuned-out body language has appeared to become part of his strategy this trial to not act out as he did previously during the New York civil fraud trial last fall and the E. Jean Carroll defamation case in January. But Trump\u2019s demeanor shifted on Thursday afternoon as the attention turned to Cohen and the media. He sat up in his chair facing directly toward Cohen as Blanche quizzed the witness about his conversations with New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman \u2013 who has come up previously in the trial in the form of a Trump tweet attacking her in 2018. When Cohen told Blanche he has recorded roughly 40 conversations with reporters over the years, Trump turned to his attorney Susan Necheles and they both smirked at the response. As for Cohen, he kept a calm demeanor throughout the testimony, choosing his words carefully and speaking slowly in his answers, even when Blanche\u2019s pacing sped up considerably. Cohen frequently asked Blanche to repeat questions to him, particularly after an objection from prosecutor Susan Hoffinger was overruled by the judge. The contrast of Cohen\u2019s approach to his testimony was on display for the jury when Blanche played a recording of Cohen on his \u201cMea Culpa\u201d podcast from May 30, 2023. The podcast Cohen spoke much more rapidly and with a hefty dose of excitement when discussing the indictment. \u201cI truly f**king hope that this man ends up in prison,\u201d Cohen says on the podcast. \u201cBut revenge is a dish best served cold, and you better believe I want this man to go down and rot inside for what he did to my family.\u201d Trial nearing an end? Before leaving for the weekend, Merchan told the lawyers to be prepared to give summations on Tuesday \u2013 meaning the jury could have the case as early as next week. Prosecutors told Merchan they have no other witnesses to call after Cohen is off the stand, and the defense said it plans to call one campaign finance expert, though that is not set in stone. Blanche said the defense could still choose to call additional witnesses to challenge testimony, and Trump\u2019s team maintains it has not made a decision on whether the former president will testify in his own defense. There\u2019s also the possibility, as CNN has reported, that former Cohen attorney Bob Costello could appear. Costello made an impression during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing Wednesday where he repeatedly attacked Cohen and said \u201cvirtually every statement\u201d Cohen made on the stand about\u00a0Costello\u00a0was a lie. The other complicating factor is there are only three days of court next week leading up to the Memorial Day holiday. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal for there to be a big lapse\u201d between summations and when the jury will be given final instructions by the judge before beginning deliberations, Merchan told the lawyers on Thursday. Merchan didn\u2019t say what that would mean for next week\u2019s schedule \u2013 an early start or going later was one option, he suggested \u2013 but it all indicates that the judge believes the jury could end up beginning deliberations next week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/takeaways-trump-trial-michael-cohen-thursday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_biden-administration-speed-migrant-court-cases", "text": "The Biden administration plans to speed up court cases for some recently arrived migrants who are seeking asylum, marking the latest move to address arrivals at the US-Mexico border, according to senior administration officials. The Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department announced Thursday a new court docket targeting migrants who have unlawfully crossed the US southern border. Migrants placed on the docket will have their cases resolved within 180 days \u2014cutting the process down by months, if not years. The new docket applies to single adults who are released from government custody and headed to one of five destination cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. \u201cToday, we are instituting with the Department of Justice a process to accelerate asylum proceedings so that individuals who do not qualify for relief can be removed more quickly and those who do qualify can achieve protection sooner,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. \u201cThis administrative step is no substitute for the sweeping and much-needed changes that the bipartisan Senate bill would deliver,\u201d Mayorkas added, referring to a border security deal that Senate Republicans blocked earlier this year. \u201cBut in the absence of Congressional action we will do what we can to most effectively enforce the law and discourage irregular migration.\u201d Thursday\u2019s announcement is reminiscent of a similar move targeting migrant families in 2021 \u2014 and previous attempts to quickly hear cases under the Obama and Trump administrations.\u00a0Immigrant advocates and attorneys have previously raised concerns over rushing asylum cases and undermining due process. \u201cIn general, we do view the dedicated docket as having achieved its objective of getting people through the immigration court process much faster than we would normally get people through the process,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters Thursday, acknowledging that deporting individuals if ordered to be removed has been challenging given resource constraints. Immigrants fighting deportation generally have a chance to make their case in court, where they can ask a judge to allow them to stay in the US by arguing they qualify for asylum or another legal option. Cases can often take years because of an immigration court backlog, prompting the effort to set up a process intended to expeditiously work through cases. The immigration court backlog exceeds 3 million pending cases, according to Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse or TRAC, which tracks immigration court data. Around 10 immigration judges have been assigned to start working on these dockets, as soon as this week, according to another administration official. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified judges who have availability to manage to do these and manage along with all the existing work that they\u2019re doing,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cAs conditions merit, we\u2019ll adjust as is necessary.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/biden-administration-speed-migrant-court-cases/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden", "text": "Joe Biden sounded more like a professional wrestler than a president when he issued a vertical video social media debate challenge to his rival Wednesday morning. \u201cDonald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020!\u201d Biden said at the outset of the 14-second video, during which he also found time to: \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to Rumble!!!\u201d Trump said, accepting the challenge on his social media platform with a nod to words that typically open boxing matches. The debates are set for June 27 on CNN and September 10 on ABC News. While Biden proposed two meetings and a vice presidential in late July, Trump\u2019s campaign suggested debates in July and August \u2013 the months when the Republican and Democratic nominating conventions are taking place \u2013 as well. \u201dI think we should go two hours,\u201d Trump said during an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, an attempt to criticize Biden\u2019s endurance. Trump added that the debaters should be required to stand at a podium rather than sit. \u201cI think a debate should be standing up,\u201d he said. Both men, well into their Social Security and Medicare years, would like to appear as forceful as possible. CNN invited the presumptive nominees to debate on the network on June 27 at CNN\u2019s studio in Atlanta. It\u2019ll be on cable, so not exactly pay-per-view, but certainly not the aired-everywhere style that has become typical of presidential debate since the Commission on Presidential Debates started sponsoring them in 1988. Those commission-sponsored debates were broadcast on every network with the same sets reused every four years and conducted usually at colleges and universities with live audiences. A town hall version allowed select voters to ask questions of both candidates. The commission said its debates are planned and it will carry forward with planning. The CNN debate, on the other hand, will be conducted in a TV studio with no audience, which means no applause or cheering. While the specific format for the ABC News debate has not been announced, a debate at ABC News studios in New York would harken back to the first televised presidential debates in 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated four times. While he has accepted both invitations, Trump was already criticizing the idea of an in-studio debate. In a social media post that included an insult for Biden, Trump said he preferred, \u201cfor excitement purposes, a very large venue, although\u00a0Biden\u00a0is supposedly afraid of crowds.\u201d Still, Biden\u2019s challenge and Trump\u2019s response were not entirely spontaneous. From CNN\u2019s report: Informal conversations between the Biden and Trump campaigns about debates have taken place in recent weeks and were largely focused on a mutual disdain for the Commission\u00a0on Presidential Debates and potential scenarios to work around the commission, three sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.\u00a0The Washington Post was first\u00a0to report on those conversations. June is already shaping up to be an exceptionally busy month in US politics. The Supreme Court could rule then on whether Trump should enjoy any sort of absolute immunity from prosecution. Biden\u2019s son Hunter faces two separate criminal trials, one for tax evasion in Los Angeles and the other for a rarely prosecuted gun charge in Delaware. CNN\u2019s debate that month will come before either party conducts its nominating convention, presumably before Trump picks a running mate, and much earlier than the commission\u2019s planned debates, the first of which had been scheduled for September. After grumbling from both campaigns, the Commission on Presidential Debates issued a statement arguing that beginning in September would still allow for early voters to watch before making a decision. The campaigns clearly disagreed; Trump and Biden have both argued that earlier debates are warranted since many Americans are likely to vote early in the months before Election Day on November 5. Biden, for his part, may be looking for a quicker opportunity to reset the narrative of the campaign, in which his arguments about the strength of the economy or the threat Trump poses to democracy have not yet helped him gain traction in battleground states. Trump, meanwhile, could benefit from turning the conversation away from his criminal trials and work to harden perceptions of Biden as soon as possible. One person who has already indicated he is not thrilled with the debate plans: independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In order to qualify for CNN\u2019s debate, a candidate must be polling at or above 15% in four national polls of registered or likely voters between March 13 and June 20 and be on the ballot in enough states to conceivably win 270 electoral votes, according to a news release from CNN. ABC News outlined similar criteria. For now, that would exclude Kennedy. In a post on X, he accused the campaigns of \u201ccolluding\u201d to keep him off the stage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/presidential-debate-or-prize-fight-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_cohen-cross-examination-2024-election", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen goes back on the stand Thursday braced for another bruising day of cross-examination that is shaping up as the most crucial chapter in the first criminal trial of a former president. Cohen is the last prosecution witness, and his testimony is a sign that the trial \u2013 arising from a hush money payment Trump allegedly made to an adult film star and efforts to cover it up \u2013 is moving swiftly toward a climax that could rock the last five months of the election. Trump\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d endured a withering grilling Tuesday, as Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche sought to puncture his credibility, portraying him as a liar obsessed with the ex-president who was raking in a fortune with his quest to bring him down. CNN\u2019s Paula Reid reported that Blanche \u2013 whose cross-examination some outside observers said was erratic and over personalized on Tuesday \u2013 will strike directly at charges that Trump ordered the payment to cover up an alleged affair to mislead voters in an early instance of election interference in 2016. (Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case). Blanche is also expected to challenge Cohen\u2019s memory of conversations with Trump. And he will seek to sow doubt within jurors\u2019 minds that a decision of such magnitude should be made on the word of Cohen alone, Reid reported. Two significant strategic questions remain unanswered. The first centers on whether the presumptive GOP nominee will testify \u2014 after initially signaling he would like to despite the view of many legal experts that he\u2019d be courting disaster on the stand. It\u2019s also unclear how many witnesses the defense will call, or whether Trump\u2019s attorneys will make a bold argument that the state of New York has failed to meet the bar of proving Trump\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and rest their case. However things unfold, it\u2019s obvious that following summations from both sides, the jury will retire within days to consider a verdict that will effectively decide whether, for the first time in history, a major political party will nominate a convicted felon for president. A suddenly compressed political calendar Every criminal trial is a grave process since a defendant\u2019s reputation and even liberty is on the line. But this case is especially momentous, given the identity of the accused \u2014 a former president who has about a 50-50 chance to win back the White House, according to national polls. The trial is one of several critical events weighing on the destiny of the presidential race in a suddenly compressed political calendar that means voters will be wrestling with their critical choice long before Election Day in November. For instance, long-held doubts that there\u2019d be any presidential debates were dispelled Wednesday morning as President Joe Biden threw down the gauntlet in a video, telling Trump, \u201cMake my day, pal,\u201d while his campaign suggested debates in late June and early September. Biden later said he\u2019d accepted a CNN debate on June 27. Trump quickly accepted. Later that morning, both men said they\u2019d accepted an invitation from ABC for a second debate on September 10. The sudden breakthrough means that debates will take place far earlier than usual in the campaign \u2014 even before either party has officially anointed their nominee at conventions in July for the GOP and in August for the Democrats. There\u2019s some logic to the shift because voting starts in some states as early as September. But the development also means that the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which has hosted debates since 1988 and has angered both parties in recent years, now seems to be on borrowed time and is at risk of becoming the latest tradition to be swept away in the turbulent Trump era. The 81-year-old Biden\u2019s decision to take Trump on is a risk since any flubs attributable to his age could play into the ex-president\u2019s claim that he\u2019s not fit to serve a second term. Some commentators have also argued that Biden should not offer the implied legitimacy of the debate stage to a former president who has been indicted over an attempt to destroy democracy after the 2020 election. But Trump, himself 77, might have already hurt himself by setting a low bar that will allow the president to outperform expectations. The former president frequently comments outside the Manhattan courtroom, for example, that Biden can\u2019t string two sentences together. And any repeat of Trump\u2019s over-torqued performance in the first presidential debate in 2020 could validate Biden\u2019s claim he\u2019s extreme and a danger to the Constitution. Critical Supreme Court ruling Another key development that could weigh heavily on the campaign could occur at about the same time as the first debate. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver its decision on Trump\u2019s sweeping claims of immunity from prosecution. High court rulings are always difficult to predict. But the signs from oral arguments on the issue last month were that the justices could send the case back to lower courts for yet more litigation. That would almost certainly delay Trump\u2019s trial in his federal election interference case until after the election, meaning he wouldn\u2019t be brought to account for the worst attack on democracy in modern times before a subsequent election. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers have long sought to delay Trump\u2019s reckoning on this and other cases until after an election that could make him president again and furnish him with powers that could allow him to halt federal trials against him. Two other cases \u2014 a state one over election interference in Georgia and a federal one arising from his hoarding of classified documents at his Florida home \u2014 have also been bogged down in pre-trial litigation and are unlikely to take place before voters choose their next president. This raises the possibility that an election long expected to be mired in Trump\u2019s legal nightmares could suddenly be dominated by a different kind of political mood music. In that case, the hush money trial may be the only one held before the election. It\u2019s impossible to predict how a guilty verdict or an acquittal would influence undecided voters in swing states who will decide the identity of the next president. Some polling suggests some Republicans might think twice about picking Trump if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the hush money case is widely considered the least serious criminal issue facing the ex-president. And Trump and his Republican supporters \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up at the courthouse Tuesday \u2014 are stepping up attempts to portray the trial as politically motivated, possibly to hedge against a possible conviction. The pre-verdict spin is another sign that a trial that\u2019s taken the country across a historic threshold may be moving toward its conclusion \u2014 at a moment when other forces that could decide the election are gathering pace.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/cohen-cross-examination-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_us-gaza-pier-moving-construction", "text": "The floating pier that will allow for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza from the sea has been anchored to a beach in Gaza, according to US Central Command (CENTCOM). Personnel anchored the pier at about 7:40 a.m. local time, \u201csupporting the humanitarian mission to deliver additional humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians,\u201d CENTCOM said in a statement. The pier had traveled on Wednesday from the port of Ashdod, about 30 miles away, to the Gaza beach. Aid will begin being delivered through pier in the coming days, Pentagon and USAID officials told reporters on Thursday, citing the \u201cskyrocketing\u201d humanitarian needs in Gaza. Trucks are expected to begin moving the aid ashore in the coming days, while the United Nations will coordinate distribution within the besieged strip, CENTCOM said, adding that no US troops had entered Gaza. \u201cThis is necessary because of the absolutely dire conditions in Gaza,\u201d said\u00a0Sonali Korde, the assistant to the administrator of USAID\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. \u201cConditions on the ground have not improved and in the past two weeks we have seen a vital border crossing close, and at a time when it is critical we see more aid move. Across Gaza, 2.2 million people the entire population, is facing acute food insecurity.\u201d The new humanitarian assistance entry point will become operational at a critical moment given the Rafah border crossing into Gaza has been closed for more than a week, preventing aid from getting through the\u00a0sole crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\u00a0The US State Department warned that only 50 humanitarian aid trucks made it through to Gaza on Sunday, down from hundreds per day in previous weeks, adding that the number is \u201cnot nearly enough.\u201d The Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) system consists of two parts: the floating pier where shipments will be offloaded and the causeway to transfer the shipments to the distribution point in Gaza. On Wednesday, the UK announced that its first shipment of humanitarian aid, including 8,400 temporary shelters, is on its way from Cyprus to Gaza. Cyprus is the staging point for the humanitarian aid that will be shipped to Gaza through the maritime corridor and the pier. \u201cThe aid will be distributed within Gaza as soon as feasible,\u201d the UK said in its announcement. Tons of aid ready for delivery In total, hundreds of tons of humanitarian assistance is ready for delivery in the coming days,\u00a0said Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of the US Naval Forces Central Command, in the briefing on Thursday. The temporary pier is intended to supplement the aid going in through the land crossings into Gaza.\u00a0The goal is to get in about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the pier daily, Cooper said. That would amount to about 90 trucks a day, and the goal is to build up to 150 trucks a day, he added. Earlier in the week, Cooper\u00a0stressed that the pier was not intended to replace land routes into Gaza, and there would be \u201cno US military boots on the ground in Gaza.\u201d Cooper also laid out how the process would go. First, the aid arrives in Cyprus where it is screened and prepared. Then, large commercial ships bring that aid to a \u201cfloating platform\u201d near the Gaza coast, where it is then transferred to smaller vessels that can dock at the temporary pier. Once ashore, the aid will be distributed into Gaza by the UN and World Food Program. There are currently \u201chundreds of tons of aid ready for delivery and thousands of tons of aid in the pipeline,\u201d from multiple nations, Cooper said. The main role of the US military is to provide its \u201cunique logistics capability,\u201d Cooper said. Korde stressed that there are many other nations and players involved in the overall operation. \u201cThis is a complex aid mission that requires continuous coordination between many partners. The support and contributions of the United Nations, the government of Cyprus and other international partners, including the UK, EU, UAE and France just to name a few, is vital. Uniting all of us and underpinning this entire mission is a commitment to save lives,\u201d Korde said. There are two coordination cells in place for this operation, one in Israel and one in Cyprus, and those have been up and running for weeks, Cooper said on Thursday. Those involved in the cells include: Israeli partners, the US, the Cypriots, the UN, and NGOs. The humanitarian organizations in Gaza will determine how to ensure that the aid reaches those in need in a \u201cindependent, neutral and impartial manner consistent with humanitarian principles,\u201d said Korde. Still, after weeks of efforts, the deconfliction efforts between NGOs and Israel to protect humanitarian workers in Gaza are not where they need to be, US officials warned on Thursday. \u201cThe deconfliction measures are not where they need to be yet, given the complexity of the environment,\u201d Korde said, noting that humanitarian workers need to feel safe. The officials also stressed that the Israeli government has been \u201chighly supportive\u201d of the US mission to get the pier set up. Challenges along the way Last week,\u00a0CNN reported that the US still faced a number of obstacles\u00a0before JLOTS could begin operations. The US was closely watching whether what it called a \u201climited\u201d Israeli incursion into Rafah in southern Gaza would affect the temporary pier. In addition, the US had not yet finalized plans about who would transport the humanitarian aid shipments from the causeway to the distribution point in Gaza. On Monday, the Pentagon said it had contracted drivers for the pier, though it declined to identify the drivers. \u201cI can just tell you it\u2019s a third-party contractor, but that\u2019s it,\u201d deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a press briefing. Once the humanitarian aid arrives in Gaza, the UN World Food Program will distribute it to the Palestinian population. On Tuesday, Ryder said security was in place to allow JLOTS operations to begin when the pier was ready. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll have the security in place that we need,\u201d Ryder said. JLOTS will cost approximately $320 million to operate for the first three months, according to the Pentagon. Cooper also addressed security concerns, saying the US and Israel have developed a plan to protect all personnel working on the project in the area, though he did not share more specific details.\u00a0On Thursday, he said the\u00a0that the US will be re-assessing the security environment daily to make sure that the operation can continue. Dan Dieckhaus, the response director of USAID, acknowledged there is \u201cconstant risk\u201d \u2013 but added that JLOTS and the causeway are not \u201cexposed to any additional risk above and beyond that which is already present in Gaza.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/us-gaza-pier-moving-construction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_giving-circles-women-donors-j-smith-cameron", "text": "J. Smith-Cameron thinks she\u2019s found a secret weapon. For the past two years, the \u201cSuccession\u201d actress has led a giving circle that pools donations from her friends, friends of friends and their friends \u2014 more than 400 strong so far in 2024 \u2014 to help flip state legislatures blue. And while most giving circle leaders aren\u2019t celebrities, the majority are women \u2014 a stark contrast with the gender imbalance that typically characterizes American political donating. Her circle, called the State Fair, is run through the States Project, which was founded in 2017 to help shift power in state legislatures and has emerged as a major player on the left  countering the right\u2019s long-standing investment in state races. That dominance of women in the States Project\u2019s giving circles \u2014 they are 82% of leaders and 75% of donors \u2014 is revealing when and how women choose to make political donations. And it reflects the heightened salience with which liberal-leaning voters, particularly women, are seeing state races, especially after Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. When it comes to traditional campaign contributions, women still lag behind men. Women were about 45% of donors to state House and Senate general election campaigns between 2019 and 2022, according to research from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University (CAWP). Their representation is even lower\u00a0as a percentage when looking at the total contributions to state House and Senate races; about 30%\u00a0came from women, demonstrating how they often give in smaller amounts compared with men. By contrast, 72% of the money raised through the States Project\u2019s giving circles between 2020 and 2023 came from women. \u201cWe know that women out-vote men, but we don\u2019t always think about giving as a form of participation and having your voice heard,\u201d said Kira Sanbonmatsu, a senior scholar at CAWP. \u201cSo mechanisms such as giving circles can make a difference.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 abortion decision, which overturned the federal right to abortion and sent the issue back to the states, accelerated the movement. The number of States Project giving circles boomed from 75 in March 2022, before the ruling, to 314 that November. There are now 183 active circles. On a recent Thursday night, a group of about 20 people \u2014 the majority women \u2014 gathered over Zoom to learn about how their small donations could help defend the Pennsylvania state House and flip the state Senate this year. Their circle, Wake Up PA!, has already raised nearly $64,000 of their $100,000 goal. That may not sound like a lot of money for an election. But that\u2019s a central part of the pitch made to newcomers on the Zoom: It doesn\u2019t take as much money to sway a state House race as a US House race, and pooling small-dollar donations is a way for voters to shift power in legislatures that may have the authority to draw electoral maps, approve slates of electors to send to Washington, DC, and increasingly have control over abortion rights. The States Project \u2014 which funnels the money to the PAC for America\u2019s Future \u2014 is projecting it will raise more than $10 million for 2024 through its giving circle program; more than $5 million has been committed so far. Smith-Cameron is the first to admit that the concept of raising money for state races doesn\u2019t always come easily. It didn\u2019t for her at first, either. After first hearing about the States Project\u2019s giving circles in 2018, she didn\u2019t start her own until several years later. \u201cI couldn\u2019t process it. And I think this is an interesting thing \u2014 it\u2019s such news to people that so many huge, earth-shaking things happen, actually, on the state level. And, like most Democrats, I kind of let it glance off me because we\u2019re so dazzled by the big races on the national level,\u201d she said. But now, Smith-Cameron said, she can sleep at night. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing something concrete. Doable. Affordable,\u201d said the multiple Emmy nominee for her \u201cSuccession\u201d role. (The show aired on HBO, which like CNN,\u00a0is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.) She\u2019s hosted virtual silk pajama and martini parties for members of her circle, as well as more intimate soirees at her New York City apartment. Her circle sent money to help flip the Pennsylvania state House in 2022 and flip the Virginia House of Delegates and defend the state Senate last year. \u201cIf you only have $100 to give, that is a perfect place to put it because it won\u2019t just be spitting into the wind,\u201d Smith-Cameron added, alluding to some \u201ccause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\u201d Democratic US Senate campaigns whose social media buzz raised millions of dollars but didn\u2019t result in victory. But any amount will do. \u201cThere\u2019s no minimum and no maximum,\u201d noted Melissa Walker, the head of giving circles for the States Project. Each circle decides for itself what state it would like to direct its money to, with some holding a \u201cstate selection party\u201d where members vote. Regardless of donations, \u201ceveryone is valued equally in this giving circle,\u201d Jan Swenson, one of the organizers of Wake Up PA!, told the group\u2019s Zoom meeting. \u201cBecause our donations are combined, we can see our total grow, and that\u2019s incredibly motivating,\u201d added co-leader Jessica Diamond. \u201cPart of the brilliance of the model is the exponential growth. \u2026 It\u2019s just about the best way to counteract the Koch brothers of the world.\u201d Why women have been so involved in giving circles Collective giving groups have long been a feature of philanthropy, although they really started to take off around the turn of this century, according to a 2024 report from the Dorothy A. Johnson Center for Philanthropy at Grand Valley State University and Philanthropy Together. And women have been at the core of that movement \u2014 92% of respondents were women in the researchers\u2019 national survey of collective giving group members for that report. \u201cI think there are gender differences that we see in other forms of data about the tendency of women to be more social, to be more connected,\u201d said Michael Layton, one of the authors of the report and the W.K. Kellogg community philanthropy chair at the Johnson Center. That connectedness is part of the beauty he sees in collective giving: \u201cIt\u2019s grounded in social capital,\u201d he said, \u201crather than financial capital.\u201d Traditional giving circles originated from a time when women didn\u2019t have independent income, Walker added. \u201cMen were earning money and not investing in the things maybe that the women wanted to, but the women would pool their pennies together and do something for the community.\u201d It\u2019s that strategery that Smith-Cameron sees resonating with her female friends. \u201cI feel like women are particularly attuned to this kind of powerful thing of gathering in groups and talking about something \u2013 it\u2019s intimate, it\u2019s demystifying,\u201d she said, noting how she\u2019s observed women are more likely to give repeatedly in smaller amounts. \u201cMy guy friends, they\u2019re more concerned about the presidential election or the Senate. And it\u2019s very, very hard to get them not to look at the shiny objects,\u201d she added. Giving circles can also be learning circles, said Walker, who was writing young adult novels and working for teen magazines when she said the 2016 election delivered a wake-up call. Walker admitted she didn\u2019t even know who her New York state legislators were before hearing former state Sen. Daniel Squadron \u2014 one of the founders of the States Project \u2014 speak at a holiday party. She and other children\u2019s book authors formed what became the first giving circle in 2017. \u201cMy dream \u2014 which is sort of a pipe dream so far but \u2014 is to have not the spotlit Senate races being talked about around dining room tables,\u201d Walker said. \u201cBut actually like what the majorities in Michigan were able to do because we won those chambers by fewer than 400 votes each.\u201d Asked about criticism that this kind of fundraising approach perpetuates out-of-state meddling in other states\u2019 elections, Walker said, \u201cState laws spread.\u201d \u201cStates are meant to be those laboratories for democracy,\u201d she added, \u201cbut they can also be laboratories for things like voter suppression bills and abortion bans.\u201d Which is one reason Smith-Cameron has been using her platform as an entertainer to talk about her work with state-level giving. \u201cIf you could get people to get the concept, you could just give this giant vitamin B12 shot to the country,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a secret weapon that\u2019s hiding in plain sight.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_nicole-shanahan-robert-kennedy-abortion", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, says their campaign supports federal limits restricting abortion access \u201cbetween 15 and 18 weeks\u201d of gestation, the latest statement on the issue after the campaign walked back recent comments made by Kennedy in opposition to government limits on abortion. Shanahan said in an interview on the \u201cCartier Family\u201d podcast released Wednesday that the Kennedy campaign \u201cvery much supports limits\u201d on abortion access, explaining that the independent presidential candidate arrived at the position after conversations with both abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion supporters on his campaign. \u201cThe campaign stance right now is very much, you know, looking at terms and limits, and the campaign very much supports limits on abortion,\u201d she said. When asked at what period the Kennedy campaign would want to set limits on abortion, Shanahan responded, \u201cIt, you know, moves around between 15 and 18 weeks.\u201d Shanahan\u2019s comments are only the latest in the Kennedy\u2019s campaign\u2019s changing viewpoints on abortion, which have ranged from total opposition to government limits to support for abortion restrictions in the final months of pregnancy in line with the framework created through Roe v. Wade. Kennedy said in a podcast interview released last week that he opposes any government limits on abortion access.\u00a0When asked if he supported keeping abortion legal\u00a0\u201ceven if it\u2019s full term\u201d \u2013 referring to the possibility of an abortion near the expected delivery date of a child \u2013 Kennedy responded affirmatively. His comments inspired blowback from the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which said his comments made him \u201cunacceptable to million of pro-life voters nationwide.\u201d Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign adviser who has guided him on abortion policies, criminal justice and Black voter outreach, publicly denounced Kennedy\u2019s comments in social media posts. Kennedy subsequently walked back\u00a0his\u00a0comment the following day\u00a0after speaking with campaign staff, including Stanton King. In a social media post clarifying his position, he said\u00a0\u201cabortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks\u201d\u00a0and that abortion should be restricted \u201cin the final months of pregnancy.\u201d In his statement, Kennedy did not say what he believed to be an appropriate limit on abortion access but\u00a0indicated\u00a0support for restrictions based on the framework\u00a0created\u00a0through Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability. Most\u00a0experts say\u00a0fetal viability occurs at around 23 to 24 weeks of gestation. \u201cI support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point. I believe that point should be when the baby is viable outside the womb,\u201d Kennedy said in the statement last week. \u201cTherefore I would allow appropriate restrictions on abortion in the final months of pregnancy, just as Roe v. Wade did.\u201d Kennedy himself previously expressed support for a federal abortion restriction at three months while he was running for president as a Democrat last year, but his campaign quickly walked back that position. In the new interview, Shanahan also expressed support for individual states deciding on abortion access, echoing Kennedy\u2019s skepticism of the federal government regulating health care. But she said she\u2019s concerned state-level abortion restrictions could make the issue \u201cover-politicized.\u201d \u201cI think that the trend towards, you know, states making these decisions is good. The thing that makes me worried in those instances is it becoming, again, over-politicized for election reasons, and then swinging too far,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause, you know, even very religious people in this country felt that, you know, the overall political politicization of this issue has led to stances that have been more extreme than they even intended.\u201d Democrats have seized on Shanahan\u2019s openness to letting individual states determine abortion access. Lis Smith, who is leading the efforts to combat third-party candidates at the Democratic National Committee, blasted the Kennedy-Shanahan ticket for being untrustworthy on the issue of reproductive rights. \u201cWow. When Nicole Shanahan sees state after state banning abortion, she thinks it\u2019s \u2018good.\u2019 This after Robert Kennedy Jr. said he would sign a national abortion ban. They CANNOT be trusted on abortion rights,\u201d Smith wrote on social media Thursday. Shanahan fired back, accusing Smith of \u201ctaking cheap shots\u201d at her and misrepresenting her policy position. \u201cI said allowing communities to work it out for themselves is good. Bringing women\u2019s choice closer to women is a positive thing,\u201d Shanahan responded. \u201cLet\u2019s agree that women in our age group are struggling to build the families they want and do something about that, rather than airlifting one word from a two-minute video and taking cheap shots.\u201d A statement from the DNC later accused Kennedy of hiding from his \u201cabortion extremism\u201d while highlighting state-level abortion restrictions that, the committee asserted, puts \u201cwomen\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d \u201cKicking it down to the states has led to dangerous abortion bans from Alabama to North Dakota, putting women\u2019s lives at risk and ripping away access to care,\u201d the statement read.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "It would be no surprise if the jury in Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial now sees his former fixer, Michael Cohen, as a profane social media troll and vengeful liar who dreams of seeing the boss he once worshipped behind bars. But jurors don\u2019t have to like Cohen. They just have to believe him. Trump\u2019s self-described former \u201cthug\u201d came under a sustained attack from defense attorney Todd Blanche Tuesday in a cross-examination meant to shatter his credibility as the star witness to the ex-president\u2019s allegedly criminal behavior. But critically, he didn\u2019t lose his composure on the stand. So far, he\u2019s avoided traps that would fatally undermine the case. Cohen will get time to take stock on Wednesday, on the trial\u2019s regular day off, which will also give Trump\u2019s team a chance to sharpen its approach. The presumptive GOP nominee, meanwhile, is due to take the opportunity to launch a fundraising swing through Ohio and Kentucky before court resumes Thursday. Cohen has already directly implicated Trump in making payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover-up their alleged affair and apparently corroborated prosecution evidence that the scheme was meant to influence the 2016 election. (Trump has denied an affair and pleaded not guilty). The task of the defense in cross-examination was, therefore, to so undermine Cohen\u2019s credibility that they sowed reasonable doubt in the minds of at least one juror about the wider case. Blanche took Cohen through a long list of the insults he\u2019s unleashed at Trump since becoming estranged from his former mentor, highlighting his penchant for serial lying. He drew jurors\u2019 attention to a social media post in which Cohen wore a T-shirt that depicted Trump in jail, as he spun a narrative of bias and obsession. Blanche also got the witness to say that he\u2019d built up a lucrative business, especially in books focused on his criticism of the former president. He asked if Cohen had called Trump a \u201cboorish cartoon misogynist.\u201d Cohen replied, \u201cSounds like something I would say.\u201d Then Trump\u2019s attorney inquired if he\u2019d mocked the ex-president as a \u201cCheeto-dusted cartoon villain.\u201d Blanche also sought to draw out Cohen\u2019s grudge against Trump, which he can later highlight to the jury in closing arguments, by asking him about a TikTok post in April in which he said Trump belonged in a \u201cf**king cage like an animal\u201d and asked him to confirm that he\u2019d also called the presumptive GOP nominee a \u201cdictator douchebag.\u201d Michael Moore, a former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said that the defense had made some progress in impeaching Cohen\u2019s credibility. \u201cI really took away that the jury is probably seeing and thinking right now that Cohen is a grifter and a waffler,\u201d said Moore, a CNN legal analyst. \u201cHe clearly is making money off this, he clearly is somebody who has got his hand in the till to sell his books.\u201d Big questions in the trial coming into focus But notably, Blanche mostly concentrated on his effort to tarnish Cohen\u2019s character, motives and credibility rather than the core question of the case \u2014 whether Trump falsified the business records as part of a cover up expressly designed to mislead voters in 2016 in an early instance of election interference. As always, when a Trump subordinate performs in front of the boss, there was a sense Blanche\u2019s histrionics were as much for the benefit of his client as the case. And in a curious debut of the cross-examination, Blanche earned an admonition from Judge Juan Merchan for making it all about him, when he noted Cohen had called him a \u201ccrying little sh*t\u201d on TikTok. Questions hanging over the case with the court dark on Wednesday start with how badly Blanche managed to damage Cohen\u2019s testimony and the prosecution case with his full-frontal assault. Given that the prosecution has already signaled it plans no further witnesses after Cohen\u2019s testimony, attention is turning to the approach the defense will take. Will Trump\u2019s lawyers bring in a number of witnesses? Or could they adopt a bold gambit by simply arguing that the prosecution has fallen woefully short of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt and dramatically rest? Then there is Trump\u2019s initial indication that he\u2019d like to testify in his own defense. The former president loves a stage and considers himself his best advocate \u2014 even if history often suggests the opposite. But many lawyers believe that given his volatile temperament and trouble telling the truth, putting him on the stand would represent a potential disaster for the defense. A key legal conundrum is whether prosecutors have so far succeeded in validating the legal theory behind the case. \u201cI think the misdemeanor of falsification of business records has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt,\u201d Shira Scheindlin, a retired US district court judge, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \u201cThe felony is a little tougher because you have to say that Trump knowingly and willfully intended to violate the election law in the state of New York by unlawful means and the unlawful means is to violate the federal campaign finance law.\u201d Scheindlin added: \u201cCohen went a long way toward making that case.\u201d As the prosecution case nears its end, there is also a growing sense that the fateful moment when Trump must wait for a jury to decide whether he will become the first president convicted of a crime is approaching. That foreboding realization was exacerbated by a new posse of Trump supporters at the courthouse on Tuesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. The Louisiana Republican brought the full symbolic heft of his office to bear in an apparent attempt to delegitimize the trial, to bolster Trump\u2019s claim that he\u2019s a victim of weaponized justice and to potentially hedge against a potential conviction with an early round of political spin. \u201cThese are politically motivated trials, and they are a disgrace,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday outside the courthouse. \u201cIt is election interference,\u201d he said. Defense tactics raise eyebrows It\u2019s impossible to know how a jury interprets testimony until a verdict is delivered \u2014 and even then, jurors often opt not to explain their verdicts in detail in media interviews in high-profile cases like this one. Some legal experts on Tuesday questioned the tone and tactics adopted by Blanche in the court. While Cohen\u2019s reluctance to offer yes-and-no answers came across at times as flippant and confrontational, he did not appear to say or do anything to torpedo the prosecution case. He did not blow up at Blanche, despite the attorney\u2019s incessant goading and an attempt to put him off his game by erratically jumping from topic to topic. \u201cNo massive disasters yet,\u201d former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe told CNN. But Moore, the CNN legal analyst, defended Blanche\u2019s approach of mixing up the evidential timeline to try to shake Cohen\u2019s pre-trial prep. \u201cYou want to make them tell the story on your terms and not to follow the script,\u201d Moore said. The prosecution knew that Blanche\u2019s attack was coming and worked all morning on Tuesday to nail down a narrative about the payment to Daniels and its purpose. Manhattan prosecutor Susan Hoffinger tried to undermine a defense claim that Trump\u2019s reimbursements to Cohen were part of a retainer for legal services and not to pay him back for the Daniels hush money payment. In a key moment in the trial, which resonated outside the courtroom given the obligations that Trump places on many of his aides and subordinates, Cohen described the moment when he broke from his former boss. \u201cMy family, my wife, my daughter, my son all said to me, \u2018Why are you holding onto this loyalty, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d Cohen said, adding that he came to a point when it was time to listen. \u201cI would not lie for President Trump any longer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_woman-charged-north-korean-it-worker-scheme", "text": "US\u00a0federal prosecutors on Thursday charged an Arizona woman with participating in an elaborate fraud scheme to help foreign IT workers pose as Americans, get hired by major US companies and earn $6.8 million in revenue that could benefit the nuclear-armed North Korean regime. The scheme compromised the identities of 60 Americans and affected 300 US companies, including a major national TV network, a \u201cpremier\u201d Silicon Valley tech company, and an \u201ciconic\u201d American car maker, says an indictment unsealed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The indictment did not name of the companies. The Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, is accused of running a \u201claptop farm\u201d from her home, in which she logged into US company-issued laptops on behalf of the foreign IT workers to trick companies into believing the workers were living in the US. At least some of the workers are described as North Korean nationals in the indictment. The court documents shed light on a broader phenomenon that US national officials have been trying to thwart for years: How thousands of North Korean overseas IT workers are trying to subvert sanctions and send untold amounts of money back to Pyongyang. Chapman is charged with nine counts including conspiracy to defraud the US. She has been arrested and is expected to make her initial court appearance in Arizona on Thursday, a law enforcement official familiar with the matter told CNN. Court records did not identify a lawyer for Chapman. \u201cThe conspiracy perpetrated a staggering fraud on a multitude of industries, at the expense of generally unknowing U.S. companies and persons,\u201d the indictment says. The overseas IT workers also \u201cattempted to gain employment and access to information at two different U.S. government agencies on three different occasions,\u201d the indictment says, not naming the agencies. Those attempts were \u201cdiscovered and thwarted,\u201d prosecutors said. In a separate criminal complaint unsealed Thursday, a Ukrainian man named Oleksandr Didenko was accused of operating at least three \u201claptop farms\u201d comprised of 79 computers in San Diego; Jefferson City, Tennessee; and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Didenko ran a business that allowed clients, including overseas IT workers, to use false identities to get hired for remote work, prosecutors alleged. A person who gave their name as Christina Chapman was among the people that Didenko shipped a laptop to, according to the complaint. When the FBI used a warrant to search Chapman\u2019s residence in October, agents found more than 90 computers, the complaint says. Three jobs filled by North Korean IT workers at US companies were tied through business records to the computers found in Chapmans\u2019 residence, according to the complaint. Didenko is accused of aggravated identity theft and wire fraud among other charges. He is not yet in custody in the US, the law enforcement official told CNN. North Korean IT workers generally pose as other nationalities, offer to work remotely and apply for jobs in gaming, IT support, and artificial intelligence, among other sectors, according to a 2022\u00a0public warning\u00a0from the State Department and other agencies. FBI agents and State and Treasury officials have been quietly trying to raise awareness of the North Korean insider threat by conducting briefings for business executives and chasing down leads about potential North Korean IT workers at US companies. Some of these IT workers work closely with North Korean hackers, who are also a rich source of revenue for the regime, according to experts. About half of\u00a0North Korea\u2019s\u00a0missile program has been funded by cyberattacks and cryptocurrency theft,\u00a0a White House official\u00a0said\u00a0last year. \u201cBy directing its IT workers to gain employment at Western companies, North Korea has weaponized its tech talent and created the ultimate insider threat,\u201d Michael Barnhart, a North Korea specialist at Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant, told CNN. \u201cThese operatives bypass sanctions by diverting their paychecks to help fund North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Simultaneously, they\u2019re providing a foothold into major organizations for North Korea\u2019s more advanced threat groups,\u201d Barnhart said. A previous CNN\u202finvestigation found that the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said. And North Korean illustrators and graphic designers appear to have helped produce work for US animation studios unbeknownst to those companies, independent researchers\u00a0told CNN last month.\u00a0The researchers discovered a trove of cartoon sketches on an open computer server on the North Korean portion of the internet. The State Department on Thursday offered $5 million in rewards for \u201cinformation that leads to the disruption\u201d of North Korean money laundering or other financial fraud. The State Department rarely reveals details of the fruits of its \u201cRewards for Justice\u201d program, which the department says has paid about $250 million to some 125 people worldwide over the last 40 years for tips that helped apprehend terrorists and counter national security threats. But the department did say on Thursday that it had paid $5 million each to two unnamed people whose information \u201chelped disrupt an illicit financial scheme that benefited\u201d North Korea.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/woman-charged-north-korean-it-worker-scheme/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The proposed changes would amount to significant changes to federal marijuana law, and could provide a political boost to the president at a moment he is working to bolster his appeal among young voters. Biden has already pardoned federal marijuana offenders and urged individual state governors to take similar steps. On Thursday, the Justice Department is taking the next formal step in the process of easing federal restrictions on cannabis, according to a senior administration official. The rescheduling proposal will appear publicly in the Federal Register, opening it up for a 60-day public comment period. After, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration can assign an administrative law judge to consider evidence in the proposal and make a final scheduling recommendation. The final step comes when the Justice Department makes a final scheduling determination. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds on the work we\u2019ve already done to pardon a record number of federal offenses for simple possession of marijuana. It adds to the action we\u2019ve taken to lift barriers to housing, employment, small business loans, and so more for tens of thousands of Americans,\u201d Biden said in the video. \u201cLook folks: No one should be in jail for merely using or possessing marijuana. Period.\u201d \u201cFar too many lives have been upended because of a failed approach to marijuana and I\u2019m committed to righting those wrongs. You have my word on it,\u201d he went on. While the process for rescheduling marijuana is lengthy, the president\u2019s aides believe the step is a necessary one to place the drug in a more appropriate category. For more than 50 years, marijuana has been categorized as a Schedule I substance \u2013 drugs like heroin, bath salts and ecstasy that are considered to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse \u2014 and subject to the strictest of restrictions. Biden\u2019s advisers also privately acknowledge the potential political benefit of loosening rules on marijuana, which has gained wider cultural acceptance over the last decade. Many states now allow its use, both for medical purposes and for recreation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/joe-biden-marijuana-rules/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_mike-pence-taxpayer-funds-campaign", "text": "Federal election regulators on Thursday authorized public matching funds for Mike Pence\u2019s dormant White House campaign \u2013 acting on a request the former vice president\u2019s campaign initially made in October, only weeks before he ended his short-lived bid for the Republican nomination. The Federal Election Commission certified an initial payment of $100,000 to the campaign, which had more than $1.3 million in outstanding debts at the end of March, according to its most recent filing. The taxpayer funds can go toward helping to pay off those bills and winding down any remaining campaign operations. A Pence aide did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment Thursday. Pence\u2019s request for public money, first disclosed in documents released by the FEC earlier this week, underscored the financial difficulties his campaign faced as he tried, unsuccessfully, to mount a primary bid against his onetime boss, former President Donald Trump. In all, Pence\u2019s campaign raised about $5.3 million. Most major presidential candidates stopped seeking public, matching funds years ago \u2013 rather than comply with the program\u2019s strict spending limits. Democrat Martin O\u2019Malley and the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein in 2016 were the last presidential contenders to receive the funds, according to the FEC\u2019s data. Disclosure rules In a separate action, the agency on Thursday also agreed to start drafting rules that could ultimately withhold some donor information from the public if adopted. But given the pace of rule-making, no decision is likely before this year\u2019s general election. The commissioners did reject a proposal advocated by Commissioner Allen Dickerson, a Republican and Trump appointee, that would have established a new process to fast-track individual requests to mask the personal information of political contributors who claim they likely would face harassment or threats. Some election watchdog groups had opposed Dickerson\u2019s measure. Under federal law, federal campaigns and political action committees must disclose identifying information \u2013 including names, addresses and employers \u2013 of donors who contribute more than $200. And regulators require that fundraising platforms, such as WinRed and ActBlue, disclose those details for all contributors, regardless of the donation size. Dickerson said the disclosure requirements date back to the FEC\u2019s creation in the 1970s when campaign finance records were kept on paper in the commission\u2019s office. \u201cNow, that information is available to anyone, instantly and forever, on the internet,\u201d he said. Courts have agreed to allow exceptions to disclosure rules. Most notably, the Supreme Court, during the Jim Crow era, exempted the NAACP from local and state mandates to disclose its members\u2019 identities. And the FEC has acted in individual cases to redact some personal information from public filings when requested. Although the panel rejected Dickerson\u2019s proposal to adopt a new streamlined process to withhold personal information, some commissioners signaled they were open to further debate on how to balance the tension between transparency and personal privacy. Commissioner Dara Lindenbaum, a Democrat appointed by President Joe Biden, said Congress should reconsider whether the street numbers and street names of donors\u2019 addresses must be publicly disclosed. \u201cConsider a victim of domestic violence who retreats to the refuge of a childhood home or a family member\u2019s residence, only for their abuser to locate them by searching their parents\u2019 or other family members\u2019 names on the commission\u2019s website,\u201d she said. Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform with the Campaign Legal Center watchdog group, said his organization would have to closely examine any proposed changes to disclosure requirements and he would be concerned about new rules resulting \u201cin a net loss of information about who\u2019s spending on elections.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/mike-pence-taxpayer-funds-campaign/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

According to audio of the event shared with CNN, Shanahan laughed off the suggestion that \u201cBobby only picked her for her money\u201d as she argued that the capital would allow Americans to have an additional choice come November.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_sex-education-bills-united-states-dg", "text": "Less than halfway through the year, 2024 has already broken the record for the most sex education bill proposals in state legislatures since at least 2018. At least 135 bills \u2014 the majority of which would place restrictions on sex education in K-12 public schools \u2014 have been introduced or are currently active as of April 12, according to a CNN analysis of data exclusively provided by SIECUS, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, a non-profit organization advocating for comprehensive sex education in the United States. Since the Supreme Court\u00a0eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion\u00a0in 2022, there has been a significant increase in legislation restricting how sex education is taught in schools, especially in states limiting abortion access. Last year was the first time since at least 2018 that restrictive sex education bills outnumbered comprehensive bills in state legislatures across the country, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. Restrictive sex education bills include proposals that would ban sexual orientation or gender identity discussions, remove instruction on contraception or emphasize abstinence in sex education curricula, for example. Comprehensive bills include measures that would ensure sex education is culturally or LGBTQ-inclusive, cover topics such as consent or include information on menstrual health. About four in five sex education bills moving through legislatures in 2018 proposed making sex education more comprehensive \u2014 strengthening existing curricula and ensuring materials were medically accurate or age-appropriate, according to SIECUS. And just 11% were restrictive. Five years later in 2023, after the Dobbs ruling, there was a dramatic shift. The share of comprehensive sex education bills plummeted to 22%, and most of the bills filed in state legislatures across the country were directed toward tightening restrictions on sex education \u2014 what it can entail, what hoops parents and teachers need to jump through for students to learn about it and even who can teach it. The surge in restrictive sex education bills has not only affected states rolling back access to abortion. Restrictive bills in 2024 make up 73% of bills passing through states where abortion is banned or heavily restricted and 51% of bills considered in states where abortion is legal or protected. \u201cOne of the best ways to restrict abortion is to not educate people about what their sexual rights are, about their own bodies, how to advocate for themselves, where to get good health care,\u201d said Eva Goldfarb, a professor of public health at Montclair State University who specializes in comprehensive sexuality education. Rise in bills emphasizing parental oversight and curbing discussion around sexuality and gender Bills requiring parental oversight of sex education became more commonly introduced throughout 2023 and so far in 2024. These bills require educators to adhere at times to stringent procedures to notify and get consent from parents regarding what they can teach their children about sexual health and apply more legal liability for administrators. Kentucky\u2019s House Bill 304, for example, would require schools to notify parents if a student makes it known they are transgender or nonbinary and prohibit educators from providing instruction on any topic that parents have expressed via written notice \u201cconflicts with the family\u2019s religious or moral beliefs.\u201d The bill also states parents will have the right to sue the district or school employees for violations. In 2018 and 2019, there was a\u00a0push for sex education to include instruction on human trafficking, child sexual abuse and dating violence prevention, CNN found. That, along with efforts to require consent to be taught in sex education, has dwindled in recent years. Bills proposing banning sex education instruction in specific grade levels \u2014 typically elementary school \u2014 have become more common. At least 12 bills aimed at banning early childhood sex education were introduced or were active in 2023, followed by eight bills in 2024. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re doing ourselves a disservice by calling early childhood education \u2018sex education,\u2019\u201d said Alison Macklin, policy and advocacy director of SIECUS. When people think about sex education, many often think about how the body works, genitalia and reproduction, but it encompasses much more than that, said Macklin. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching basic core concepts of decision making, speaking up for oneself,\u201d she said. \u201cThen as the person develops, and as they mature, we start to add in more sexual content.\u201d She emphasized that early childhood sex education includes topics such as learning how to use anatomically correct terminology when talking about their bodies, which has been proven to reduce child sexual abuse, and how to say \u201cno\u201d in everyday life. Those topics are getting cut in some schools. Idaho\u2019s HB 228, for instance, passed last year and redefines sex education solely as the study of anatomy and physiology of human reproduction. Georgia\u2019s Senate Bill 532, which was\u00a0tabled by the state Senate in February,\u00a0would have prohibited sex education prior to fifth grade and required schools to give parents the \u201cpublic opportunity to review and to provide comment on proposed sex education curricula.\u201d\u00a0Missouri\u2019s SB 1024\u00a0would ban instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation between kindergarten through third grade. Idaho was one of 25 states that proposed restrictive legislation last year and one of 28 states so far in 2024. This year, Oklahoma has taken the lead with 10 restrictive bills currently active in its legislature. Meanwhile, seven bills proposing more comprehensive sex education have been introduced or are active in Minnesota\u00a0so far in 2024 \u2014 more than any other state. Although lawmakers have put forth numerous bills, only a handful have been passed in the last few years. Just 11 of more than 320 sex education bills that have been introduced since 2022 have passed. In 2023, eight of the total 114 bills were signed into law \u2014 all eight were restrictive. Only one bill, also restrictive, has been approved so far in 2024. Because bills banning sex education outright or restricting it to certain grade levels are finding limited success passing in legislatures, conservative lawmakers are trying more indirect approaches, said Nawal Umar, a senior policy analyst at SIECUS. \u201cThe overarching trend that we\u2019re noticing is that these bills that are sort of indirectly impacting sex education \u2026 are more likely to pass.\u201d This includes bills like Idaho\u2019s HB 666, which doesn\u2019t address sex education in schools.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court.

Giuliani is among a group of former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies indicted last month in Arizona alongside the 11 individuals who acted as fake GOP electors from the state in the last presidential election. But the former New York City mayor and one-time attorney for Trump is the only defendant prosecutors have been unable to serve with a summons, according to Richie Taylor, a spokesperson for the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office. The summons is a formal notice that Giuliani has been criminally charged and must appear before a judge on May 21, and a team of prosecutors and investigators working for Arizona Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes has made multiple attempts to locate him, Taylor told CNN. CNN has reached out to a spokesman for Giuliani for comment. Giuliani, multiple associates have told CNN, is in Palm Beach, Florida, at his residence. According to two sources familiar with Giuliani\u2019s movements, the former mayor has been traveling back and forth between Palm Beach and New York City where he has been alternating between working on a planned appeal of the $148 million defamation judgment against him, which a district judge denied Tuesday, and the sale of his $5.7 million New York City apartment, where prosecutors have tried for weeks to serve him. According to Taylor, two agents for the attorney general\u2019s office traveled to New York City with plans to hand-deliver the notice to Giuliani the day after the state-level grand jury handed up its indictment. The agents believed Giuliani was likely in his New York City apartment because he had recently video streamed from there \u2013 which they determined by matching the setting of the feed with pictures of the interior of the residence from an old real estate listing. But upon arriving at the building, a person at the front desk told the agents they were not allowed to accept service of the documents, according to Taylor, who added that the individual did not dispute Giuliani lived there. \u201cWe were not granted access,\u201d Taylor added, confirming details previously reported by the Washington Post. While Trump is not among those charged in Arizona, the details in the indictment suggest he is \u201cUnindicted Coconspirator 1.\u201d \u201cIn Arizona, and the United States, the people elected Joseph Biden as President on November 3, 2020,\u201d the indictment reads. \u201cUnwilling to accept this fact, Defendants and unindicted coconspirators schemed to prevent the lawful transfer of the presidency to keep Unindicted Coconspirator 1 in office against the will of Arizona\u2019s voters.\u201d Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, his close adviser Boris Epshteyn, the Republican National Committee\u2019s top lawyer for \u201celection integrity\u201d Christina Bobb and former Trump campaign aide Mike Roman are among those charged in Arizona alongside Giuliani.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_doj-republicans-democrats-what-matters", "text": "The long-standing allegation from former President Donald Trump is that President Joe Biden has weaponized the Department of Justice and that there is a double standard for Republicans as compared with Democrats. There\u2019s plenty of evidence otherwise lately. Sen. Bob Menendez, the up-for-reelection Democrat from New Jersey, is on trial for bribery for the second time in seven years \u2013 and across the street from where Trump\u2019s New York state trial related to hush money payments is taking place in Manhattan. Menendez denies the allegations, which include that he and his wife accepted gold bars, envelopes of cash and much more. In Texas, federal prosecutors have brought corruption charges against Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat, for allegedly taking nearly $600,000 in bribes, including from a foreign oil and gas company. Cuellar denies the allegations. Another Democrat, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, is the subject of a federal probe into her campaign spending, according to a CNN report in January. She has denied wrongdoing and defended paying her husband for security services. Evidence against the idea of political bias The cases above, if nothing else, are a serious complication to Trump\u2019s often-repeated claim that he is the subject of a partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d So is\u00a0prosecution of Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, in a gun case in Delaware that is rarely brought as a stand-alone charge, and a separate tax case in California. Both trials are slated to begin in June. Yes, Trump is the subject of two, distinct prosecutions brought by special counsel Jack Smith, concerning the former president\u2019s refusal to return classified material to the National Archives after he left the White House and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Both of those prosecutions are currently on hold. But it\u2019s worth noting that federal prosecutors passed on charging Trump for the hush money payments scheme that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg later pursued. An\u00a0unusually feisty Attorney General Merrick Garland\u00a0rejected any claim of bias during testimony on Capitol Hill last September. \u201cOur job is not to do what is politically convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress or from anyone else about who or what to criminally investigate.\u201d The Cuellar indictment, the Bush probe and the beginning of the Menendez trial are new developments to add to a running list of federal prosecutions I first compiled last year. Here\u2019s a look at active and recent federal cases against federal lawmakers and governors. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but it is what I could find going back to 2000 in CNN\u2019s coverage and from other news outlets. Ongoing federal cases against sitting federal lawmakers There is one against a Republican,\u00a0expelled Rep. George Santos\u00a0of New York, and two against Democrats, Menendez and Cuellar. No charges have yet been filed against Bush. There is also a non-prosecution to mention. Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, was informed last year by the DOJ that he\u00a0would not be charged\u00a0in a long-running sex trafficking probe. Federal cases against recent members of Congress These are federal cases against current or former federal lawmakers. I was able to find nine targeting Republicans and eight targeting Democrats. Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican from Nebraska\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Found guilty\u00a0in 2022 of three felonies in a case that centered on campaign contributions. Former Rep. TJ Cox, a Democrat\u00a0from California\u00a0\u2013 Still awaiting trial after his\u00a02022 indictment, including for fraudulent campaign contributions. He was offered a plea deal, according to local reports. Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican\u00a0from California\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 11 months in prison\u00a0for misusing\u00a0campaign funds, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Corrine\u00a0Brown, a Democrat\u00a0from Florida\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Served more than two years\u00a0for setting up a false charity. Former Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican\u00a0from Texas\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 10 years\u00a0in prison\u00a0for multiple felonies including fraud and money laundering, but\u00a0pardoned by Trump\u00a0after serving part of his sentence. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner, a Democrat from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 21 months\u00a0in prison\u00a0for sexting with a minor. Former Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat from Pennsylvania\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 10 years in prison\u00a0for racketeering, fraud and money laundering. Former Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican\u00a0from New York\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Pleaded guilty and sentenced to eight months in prison\u00a0for tax evasion. Attempted to run again for Congress. Former Rep. Rick Renzi, a Republican from Arizona\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to three years for corruption. Pardoned by Trump after he served time. Sen. Bob Menendez, a\u00a0Democrat from New Jersey\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Acquitted by a judge and other charges dismissed\u00a0after a jury deadlocked in a bribery case that predates the current prosecution. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Illinois\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 30 months in prison\u00a0for misusing\u00a0campaign funds. Former Sen. Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Conviction by jury for lying on ethics forms was later set aside\u00a0over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Former Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat from Louisiana\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to 13 years for corruption and soliciting bribes. There was video of him taking $100,000 from an African official. Served multiple years in prison, but many of the charges were later vacated by a judge based on\u00a0a US\u00a0Supreme Court decision. Former Rep. Bob Ney, a Republican from Ohio\u00a0\u2013 Sentenced to 30 months\u00a0after a guilty plea for corruption\u00a0tied to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Former Rep. Randy\u00a0\u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham, a Republican from California\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to eight years in prison after a guilty plea for bribery. Later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. James Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Sentenced to eight years in prison\u00a0for corruption after defending himself during trial. Was later expelled from the House. Other prosecutions to consider Two Republican governors and two Democratic governors have been convicted in federal courts in recent decades: Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,\u00a0a Republican,\u00a0was convicted for bribery and corruption. But the US Supreme Court changed the rules in corruption and bribery cases when it\u00a0threw out the case against McDonnell. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat,\u00a0was convicted for trying to sell his power to appoint a replacement to Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat. His sentence was\u00a0later commuted by Trump. Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat,\u00a0was convicted by a jury\u00a0of bribery and corruption and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican,\u00a0was convicted on corruption charges after an FBI sting. Did we miss a federal lawmaker convicted or charged? Let me know at zachary.wolf@cnn.com. What\u2019s not included here Local prosecutions \u2013 like the state or local cases against\u00a0former Rep. Trey Radel, the Republican from Florida, for cocaine possession in Washington, DC, or former\u00a0Sen. Larry Craig, the Republican from Idaho, for lewd behavior in the Minneapolis airport \u2013 don\u2019t really fit here since they were not conducted by the Department of Justice. Some notable recent DOJ prosecutions have focused on Democrats at the state level, like Andrew Gillum, the Democrat and former Tallahassee, Florida, mayor who ran for governor and lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2018. Gillum was\u00a0acquitted of lying to the FBI. Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, also a Democrat, was\u00a0sentenced to three years in prison\u00a0after she pleaded guilty to charges related to a scheme in which local nonprofit organizations bought her self-published children\u2019s book. Trump charges Trump likes to argue he\u2019s the subject of a conspiratorial \u201cwitch hunt\u201d engineered by a deep state. Why, he will often say, was Hillary Clinton not prosecuted for her email server while he is being prosecuted\u00a0for mishandling classified material? This forgets the history of the 2016 election, which Clinton has said she lost because of then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation of her emails. Comey did not charge her before the election but did criticize her, and then, 11 days before Election Day, he said the investigation had been reopened. These whataboutisms can go on and on without changing anyone\u2019s mind.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/doj-republicans-democrats-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_bob-menendez-bribery-trial", "text": "Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s lawyer launched his defense Wednesday in a Manhattan courtroom, insisting that the New Jersey Democrat never engaged in the international bribery scheme described by federal prosecutors and asserting that there were \u201cinnocent explanations\u201d for the tangle of alleged crimes that has already upended Menendez\u2019s political career. \u201cThey want you to be blinded by the gold and the cash,\u201d Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman told the jury, suggesting that many of the items the senator allegedly took as bribes \u2013 including gold bars and a luxury car \u2013 were owned or obtained by his wife, Nadine, who is also charged and set to go on trial in July. Menendez\u00a0has been charged\u00a0with acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and assisting the government of Qatar, all while taking bribes from several New Jersey businessmen.\u00a0He is being tried with two of his co-defendants: Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. All three have pleaded not guilty.\u00a0Menendez is not running for reelection in next month\u2019s Democratic primary but has said he would consider an independent bid should he be exonerated. In a federal courthouse, blocks from the site of former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz told jurors in her opening statement that they would see evidence and hear testimony of a yearslong conspiracy between Menendez, his wife and two New Jersey businessmen to take bribes while using his power to influence military aid to Egypt and pressure prosecutors and investigators to stop investigations and criminal cases. \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket. That is why we are here today. That is what this trial is all about.\u201d While Nadine Menendez, who has also pleaded not guilty, is not yet on trial, her\u00a0alleged\u00a0actions and influence on her husband were\u00a0a key part\u00a0of the defense\u2019s opening statement. Weitzman repeatedly argued that the couple have mostly led \u201cseparate lives\u201d and \u201chad separate finances.\u201d \u201cThey even had a separate cell phone plan,\u201d he added, before spelling out a series of \u201cfinancial concerns that (Nadine) kept from Bob,\u201d whom Weitzman described as being smitten by a \u201cbeautiful and tall, international woman.\u201d Weitzman also argued that Menendez \u201cwas acting lawfully\u201d in his role as a US senator, portraying interactions prosecutors have called corrupt as mere diplomatic efforts for the US and advocacy on behalf of his New Jersey constituents \u2013 including some longtime friends. \u201cYou might not like it,\u201d Weitzman said, \u201cbut it is not a crime.\u201d In explaining the gold bars found in Menendez\u2019s house by investigators, Weitzman again pointed the finger at the senator\u2019s wife, who, he said, kept the \u201cfamily gold.\u201d Nadine, Weitzman said, is from Lebanon, where keeping gold is \u201ccultural,\u201d in part because of the region\u2019s historically unstable currencies, while adding that gifts of gold and silver are common for weddings and engagements. \u201cEvidence will show Nadine\u2019s family had a lot of gold,\u201d Weitzman said, asserting that she did not discuss money with the senator and kept financial problems she had from him. Weitzman also said the gold bars were found in Nadine\u2019s locked closet, which the senator didn\u2019t have access to. To emphasize the point, the defense showed the court an image of a walk-in closet, which appeared messy. Among the \u201cinnocent explanations,\u201d Weitzman suggested there was nothing abnormal about co-defendant Daibes\u2019 fingerprints on envelopes containing tens of thousands of dollars in cash found in the senator\u2019s home, stating that the two had been friends for decades. \u201cWould you be surprised,\u201d Weitzman asked, \u201cto find your friend\u2019s fingerprints on one of your belongings?\u201d Opening statements for Daibes and Hana will begin Thursday morning. Jury selection Pomerantz\u2019s and Weitzman\u2019s opening statements began Wednesday following the swearing-in of 12 jurors and six alternates. During\u00a0the nearly-three-day juror selection process, the pool of potential jurors was read a list of more than 100 possible witnesses in the case, from sitting and former US senators to several sheikhs and former White House officials, as well as a list of companies and entities, including Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The vast majority of those named on the witness list \u2013 which is used to help attorneys and the court whittle down the jury pool \u2013 will not be called to testify. The potential jurors \u2013 an array of New Yorkers, including pastors, a standup comedian and amateur musicians \u2013 were pressed on whether they could be unbiased and fairly consider testimony from law enforcement officers or convicted criminals. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you ladies and gentlemen how important it is that this case proceed with a fair impartial jury,\u201d federal judge Sidney Stein told the potential jurors on Tuesday, saying that means \u201cpeople who come without any bias\u201d ready to put aside \u201canything about this case\u201d they\u2019ve heard from the media. \u201cThis system will only work if people are fair and honest and impartial,\u201d Stein said. The initial group of 150 potential jurors was pared down to less than 100 after the initial phase of the selection process, during which people cited travel plans, including an overseas bar mitzvah and a Paris research grant, as well as work and health issues, when asked if any hardships would prevent them from sitting on a trial that could last over a month. One potential juror spoke about being a \u201cnews junkie\u201d who couldn\u2019t sit on the trial because \u201cI\u2019ve learned about the case significantly. I knew it was Bob Menendez the second I walked in.\u201d Stein asked if the potential juror could set aside prior knowledge and solely rely on evidence and testimony to decide this case, to which the person replied: \u201cI mean, I think so, but again, you know, this is something I\u2019ve read about.\u201d When one potential juror cited his new job at a fashion consulting agency and fears that he could be let go if he had to sit on the jury, Stein told him that the trial could be \u201cvery interesting.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to lose your job,\u201d the judge said, \u201cbut by the same token, I think you\u2019ll find this \u2013 I think all jurors would find this case \u2026 to be very interesting and informative.\u201d During the more direct phase of questioning potential jurors on what they did for a living and where they got their news, the judge was more lighthearted, bantering with them at times. After one potential juror said he worked in neuroscience, Stein told him that during a break \u201cyou\u2019ll have to tell me \u2026 how a worm gets in somebody\u2019s brain,\u201d referring to independent presidential candidate\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s revelation\u00a0about a parasitic worm previously entering his brain. \u201cAnd again, I\u2019m not doing that to be facetious; I just want to avoid it,\u201d the judge said.

{"id": "politics_redistricting-states-congressional-maps-house", "text": "Multiple Supreme Court showdowns. Closed-door negotiations.\u00a0And millions of dollars in litigation. After months of legal and legislative skirmishes around the country, much of the redistricting drama of the 2024 election cycle is behind us. And it has ended pretty close to where it began: Just a handful of seats could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold a threadbare majority. In North Carolina, newly empowered GOP state legislators took an aggressive approach with their map-drawing, crafting lines that are expected to allow their party to flip at least three seats now held by Democrats. But, in recently concluded redistricting in New York, Democrats, who had final say over the map, adopted a more modest position \u2013 essentially turning just one Republican-held seat a deeper shade of blue. In the South, Democrats are expected to gain two seats as a result of Voting Rights Act rulings out of Alabama and Louisiana. But a protracted battle over the congressional map in another Southern state, Georgia, has not changed the partisan balance of the state\u2019s US House delegation heading into November. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that with all of the states where we\u2019ve had things going on and with all the different lawsuits, we are really only talking about a small number of districts that are guaranteed to change hands as a result of this entire shuffle,\u201d said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book \u201cOne Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.\u201d \u201cWe have actually emerged nationally with a pretty fair map,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that there are ample opportunities for either party to win.\u201d Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, sees a \u201ctick to the right\u201d under the new landscape, with the likely net addition of two more House seats that former President Donald Trump would have carried in 2020. But he cautioned that it was still a \u201ctight map\u201d and a \u201ctight electorate.\u201d \u201cFrom top to bottom, the country is a 50-50 country right now,\u201d Kincaid said. (Although Republicans control the House by a narrow margin, under the map used in the 2022 midterm elections, 17 of those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed President Joe Biden in 2020.) Democrats, meanwhile, say they emerged in a stronger position after wielding the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act to prevail in legal fights in deep-red Alabama and Louisiana. Federal judges ordered lawmakers in those states to give Black residents more opportunities to elect House candidates of their choice. \u201cAlabama and Louisiana are just two states once thought to be unreachable in the fight for fairness that have quickly become more representative\u201d as a result of the legal actions, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m confident the House map will remain highly competitive going into 2024.\u201d Here\u2019s a state-by-state look at the recent redistricting disputes and where they stand: Louisiana Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state Legislature in January approved a map with a second Black-majority district that\u00a0is expected to be\u00a0in effect for this year\u2019s elections. The action, viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers the seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves. The implementation of the new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state\u2019s  congressional district lines. Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state\u2019s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 who is also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its six-member US House delegation. A federal judge threw out the state\u2019s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year. Once the high court had weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana. A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state Legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the state lawmakers\u2019 map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana\u2019s Black residents. If the Legislature had not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year\u2019s elections. A dozen non-Black voters filed a legal challenge to the Legislature\u2019s map, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander,\u00a0and a\u00a0three-judge panel agreed. That set off a fresh appeal to the US Supreme Court, which on May 15 paused the panel\u2019s ruling in an order that\u00a0will likely allow the Legislature\u2019s map\u00a0to be used in this year\u2019s elections. New York Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party\u2019s majority in the chamber. Then, a\u00a0ruling by the state\u2019s highest court\u00a0appeared to jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats. In the end, however, the Democratic state lawmakers, who hold ultimate control of the redistricting process, settled on a map that made only modest adjustments to the status quo lines. First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of\u00a0drawing the map used in the 2022 elections\u00a0following a long legal battle and the inability of New York\u2019s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats\u00a0scored a court victory last summer\u00a0when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map. Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York\u2019s Court of Appeals, the state\u2019s highest court. On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. As a result, New York\u2019s redistricting commission created a new map, but the Democratic-controlled state Legislature tinkered with the commission\u2019s lines, as permitted under state law. The\u00a0Legislature\u2019s final product\u00a0ended up putting a Central New York seat held by Republican freshman Brandon Williams at greater risk for his party. It also shored up for Democrats Tom Suozzi\u2019s Long Island seat, which the party\u00a0flipped\u00a0in a February special election to succeed expelled former Rep.\u00a0George Santos. Leaders of both political parties say they can live with the map\u2019s modest approach, which still puts the Empire State at the epicenter of the battle for the House. But some progressives have criticized New York Democrats, who hold supermajorities in the state Legislature, for not taking a more aggressive approach. Former New York Rep. John Faso, a Republican who had been a key player in litigation over redistricting, said the map drawn by Democrats \u201chas no material differences from the current map.\u201d \u201cThis turned out to be much ado about very little,\u201d he added. North Carolina North Carolina\u2019s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party\u2019s chances of retaining its House majority next year. The state\u2019s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans. A map that Republican state lawmakers approved put three House Democrats in what one expert called \u201calmost impossible to win\u201d districts. The affected Democrats were Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three opted not to seek reelection to the House. A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties. State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections gave the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state \u2013 Republicans flipped the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. Last year, the new GOP majority on the court tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering. A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court\u2019s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state\u2019s House delegation. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map \u201cintentionally discriminates\u201d against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution. Alabama In one of the cycle\u2019s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that created a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama \u2013 which is 27% Black \u2013 had only one Black-majority district out of seven seats. The fight over the map went all the way to the US Supreme Court \u2013 which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or \u201csomething quite close to it.\u201d Under the map used for the 2024 election, the state\u2019s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black. The high court\u2019s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it\u2019s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice. The ruling reverberated around the country and affected the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that centered on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states. Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending two of its members to Congress after November\u2019s elections. The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history. Georgia Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state,\u00a0finalized a new congressional map\u00a0last year that safeguarded their party\u2019s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats\u2019 hopes of adding an additional US House seat. The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district.\u00a0But it preserved the GOP\u2019s 9-5 edge in Georgia\u2019s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by\ufeff\u00a0Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory. Jones had ordered state lawmakers\u00a0to draw a new congressional map\u00a0by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census.\u00a0In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers\u2019 earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act. In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans\u2019 9-5 advantage \u201cfully complied\u201d with his order. A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds. Florida A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor\u2019s map had improperly diluted Black voting power. This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution. The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries \u2013 which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida \u2013 violated the state\u2019s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities \u201cto elect representatives of their choice.\u201d But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to present any evidence\u201d that the earlier version of the district \u2013 which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee \u2013 contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida\u2019s constitution. The case is now before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats. The disputed map appears likely to remain in place for this year\u2019s elections after the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to speed up the case and hold arguments before the congressional candidate qualifying period in April. In a separate case \u2014 centered on whether the map violates the US Constitution \u2013 a federal court sided with DeSantis. Observers say that in the end, the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution\u2019s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged. Kentucky The Kentucky Supreme Court  in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an \u201cextreme partisan\u201d gerrymander. The dispute centered on lawmakers\u2019 decision to move Kentucky\u2019s capital city \u2013 Democratic-leaning Frankfort \u2013 out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped \u2013 and solidly Republican \u2013 1st District. Doing so helped shore up the GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Republican Andy Barr. Under its previous lines, the 6th District was a more competitive seat. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.) A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state\u2019s constitution, and the state\u2019s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed. South Carolina A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines last year for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker. Last year, a three-judge panel concluded that the lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court\u2019s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers\u2019 map. The 2024 elections will proceed under the current map, the three-judge panel ruled in March. The judges, in part, cited the delay in the high court issuing a decision. New Mexico Republicans in New Mexico argued that the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amounted to an illegal gerrymander under the state\u2019s constitution. At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans had prevailed, the 2nd District seat \u2013 now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez \u2013 could have become more favorable to Republicans. But a state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed that ruling. Utah The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state Legislature. Republican state officials have argued that the court\u2019s power over redistricting decisions is limited. Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts. Doing so, the plaintiffs asserted in their lawsuit, \u201ctakes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,\u201d allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to \u201cdictate the outcome of elections.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_menendez-gold-cash-what-matters", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey faces his second, distinct bribery and corruption trial in seven years starting Monday. This new case is a complicated affair involving multiple gold bars, envelopes of cash, a Mercedes and a lot more that, prosecutors say, the powerful former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his new wife (they got married during the alleged bribery scheme) obtained in exchange for helping a halal meat monopoly, granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution. Menendez, who has until June to announce if he\u2019s running for reelection, has pleaded not guilty and denied all of the charges. He told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence.\u201d Also pleading not guilty and denying wrongdoing are his wife Nadine, who is also a named as a defendant, and two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who have ties to Egypt and Qatar, respectively. Another man, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe, on the other hand, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Here\u2019s what prosecutors say the senator and his wife got: Gold bars Prosecutors say Hana and Daibes gave Menendez and his wife gold bars, which were seized by the FBI from the Menendez residence. After returning from a trip to Egypt and getting a ride home from the airport from Daibes\u2019 driver, prosecutors say Menendez searched online for the price of a gold bar. Envelopes full of cash The indictment includes photos of piles of cash next to envelopes spread across jackets on which the senator\u2019s name is embroidered. There are piles of $20 bills and $50 bills in one photo and $100 bills in another photo. They also found cash in closets, a safe and Nadine Menendez\u2019s safety deposit box. Some of the envelopes, according to prosecutors, bore fingerprints or DNA belonging to Daibes or his driver. Total cash discovered: More than $480,000 in the home and more than $70,000 in the safety deposit box. Later court filings that added charges in the case are more specific, describing bags full of cash being found on top of hangers in the senator\u2019s basement and stuffed into boots in the closet. Convertible Mercedes The 2019 vehicle, which prosecutors value at more than $60,000, was parked in the driveway at the Menendez home when it was raided. The indictment describes Nadine Menendez obtaining $15,000 in cash from Uribe in a parking lot the day before she picked the vehicle up and put $15,000 as a down payment. Uribe is alleged to have then hid his monthly financing payments for the vehicle. Later, after the raid, she would write Uribe a $21,000 check, which prosecutors say was an effort at cleanup, making the gift look like a loan. Nadine Menendez needed a new car, apparently after hitting and killing a jaywalker in Bogota, New Jersey, in December 2018. A police report was filed but she faced no charges. Mortgage payment Prosecutors say the senator and his wife also tried to cover up around $23,000 in help Nadine Menendez got from a halal meat company owned by Hana that bailed her out of foreclosure on a mortgage. Reimbursement checks were paid in December 2022, months after the initial raid on the senator\u2019s house. Payment for low- or no-show work Hana\u2019s company paid Nadine Menendez $10,000 on three occasions, according to prosecutors. At the time, they allege, she was acting as a sort of go-between for Egyptian officials, Hana and the senator. Engagement ring Prosecutors describe a recorded conversation between Hana and a confidential source in which Hana is described as obtaining $150,000 from a man to purchase a car and an engagement ring for Nadine Menendez in exchange for the senator giving a \u201cpush\u201d in a New Jersey criminal case that saved the man three years. Basement carpeting Prosecutors said in their February court filing that Nadine Menendez arranged for carpeting to be installed in her basement, apparently in exchange for setting up dinners between the senator and officials \u2013 and also for his call, according to prosecutors, attempting to interfere in a New Jersey state prosecution. Furniture The initial September 2023 indictment makes several mentions of furniture and furnishings provided by Hana and Daibes but does not go into specifics. Formula One tickets In a superseding indictment filed in March, prosecutors allege Menendez obtained tickets to Formula One races in 2022 and 2023 for Nadine Menendez\u2019s relative. Menendez made comments supportive of Qatar during that period and lobbied Qatari officials to invest in Daibes\u2019 real estate venture, which they ultimately did. Daibes is described as sending the senator pictures of luxury watches priced between roughly $10,000 and $24,000, but it is not clear from the filing if Menendez ever obtained a timepiece. What\u2019s the quid pro quo? There is a long list of actions prosecutors say Menendez undertook in exchange for all of these alleged bribes. They allege Menendez, in his prior role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \u2026 lobbied the US Department of Agriculture to maintain Hana\u2019s monopoly on US halal meat exports to Egypt, even though it drove up prices. \u2026 met with Egyptian officials in exchange for cash. \u2026 gave Hana not-classified but also not-public information about employees at the US embassy in Egypt. \u2026 passed on information about US military sales to Egypt to Hana and signed off on certain sales. \u2026 lobbied Qataris on behalf of Daibes\u2019 real estate scheme and supported resolutions in the Senate supportive of Qatar. \u2026 tried to influence court cases in New Jersey related to Uribe and his associates. Uribe, recall, is now cooperating with prosecutors. \u2026 tried to disrupt a federal prosecution of Daibes.  Again, Menendez denies all the charges, and the jury that will get to hear his side of the story will begin to be selected in New York starting Monday. Nadine Menendez\u2019s trial is slated for July. Perhaps Menendez and his wife can convincingly argue the mortgage and car payments were a loan. Perhaps Menendez will argue he did not know about payments related to dinners and meetings organized by his wife. The envelopes of cash prosecutors say bore Daibes\u2019 fingerprints may be more difficult to explain. Menendez escaped previous bribery charge Menendez is used to being under the microscope of federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice ultimately decided not to retry Menendez in 2018 after a previous jury deadlocked over whether he accepted trips and gifts from a friend, an ophthalmologist named Salomon Melgen. Melgen went to prison in a separate Medicare fraud scheme, but that sentence was commuted by then-President Donald Trump after lobbying by Menendez on Melgen\u2019s behalf.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/menendez-gold-cash-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_debates-joe-biden-donald-trump", "text": "For two men who agree on so little, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump could agree on this: They needed to debate. After months of speculation over the traditional pre-election face-offs \u2013 when they would happen, what they would look like and whether the candidates would actually show up \u2013 the 2024 showdowns were quickly announced Wednesday morning after Biden\u2019s campaign laid out its criteria for participating. It was hardly a foregone conclusion. Trump skipped his party\u2019s primary debates, deeming them useless. Biden and his aides had long harbored deep skepticism about the traditional debate format and schedule. To Biden\u2019s team, the move to lay out its debate proposals seized back control of a narrative that he was unwilling or unable to square off against Trump. Some of the president\u2019s advisers hoped that by listing out their terms first, they could box Trump into a format he wouldn\u2019t have chosen for himself. On Wednesday, some Trump allies and advisers expressed frustration after Biden\u2019s public announcement that the quick acceptance of network debates left them playing catch up \u2014\u00a0something they described as particularly annoying\u00a0after Trump\u2019s campaign had repeatedly, and publicly, called on Biden to debate. Still, apart from Trump\u2019s desire to hold more than two debates and his urgings for a live audience, many of the conditions laid out in the Biden campaign\u2019s proposal were criteria the Trump campaign also wanted \u2013 namely, to move up the schedule by three months and to avoid sharing a stage with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The sudden resolution of one of the contest\u2019s biggest unanswered questions had actually been in the works for weeks, people familiar with the matter said, as the campaigns separately came to the conclusion that debates over the summer would benefit both their candidates and American voters. The calendar appears set for the earliest debate between Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in decades. And a campaign that had been trudging along slowly, through a GOP primary that seemed foretold and a fog of legal problems for Trump, has suddenly jolted into high gear. Howard Stern interview put gears in motion Biden\u2019s declaration last month to Howard Stern that he was \u201chappy\u201d to debate Trump, a statement that wasn\u2019t planned ahead of time, helped spur a chain of events leading up to Wednesday\u2019s announcements. Both candidates\u2019 campaigns believed that the earlier the men could debate, the better. It made little sense to debate after voters were able to cast ballots, which would have been the case if they stuck to the schedule proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Trump\u2019s advisers had privately expressed frustration at the commission, which had announced debates would begin mid-September. Susie Wiles and her fellow campaign manager Chris LaCivita criticized the body after it denied their request for more and earlier debates. Trump\u2019s advisers argue they want at least four debates but would prefer there to be more. The campaign, and Wiles and LaCivita specifically, believe having Trump and Biden face-off onstage will only benefit the former president, the two advisers said. Trump\u2019s team believes Biden has declined both physically and mentally in the four years since they last debated in 2020, one adviser said. \u201cAnything in this campaign that provides a contrast will be important for us. And there\u2019s not a better contrast than Joe Biden having to defend a miserable record standing next to successful President Trump, whose energy and enthusiasm is always present,\u201d one of the senior advisers said. A Trump adviser said the campaign believed it was critical for Trump to be able to reach voters before they made a decision on their votes \u2014 a rationale echoed by Biden\u2019s team in its letter to the commission. \u201cThe Commission\u2019s failure, yet again, to schedule debates that will be meaningful to all voters \u2013 not just those who cast their ballots late in the fall or on Election Day \u2013 underscores the serious limitations of its outdated approach,\u201d Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote. Frustration with the Commission on Presidential Debates In recent weeks, after the commission seemed disinclined to agree to their requests on timing, Trump advisers began internally discussing ways to circumvent the commission altogether. Many advisers privately acknowledged they\u2019d likely be more successful in achieving the type of debates they want by having a network hold them, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN. Top members of Biden\u2019s team had long similarly harbored reservations about the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has organized the events for decades. Two of his top advisers, Anita Dunn and Ron Klain, helped coauthor a report in 2015 recommending an overhaul to the debate system. In a statement on Wednesday, the commission said the sites it had already selected were \u201cprepared to host debates on dates chosen to accommodate early voters.\u00a0We will continue to be ready to execute this plan.\u201d For Biden\u2019s team, earlier debates hold another goal: bringing the contrast with Trump into living rooms at a moment when many potential voters haven\u2019t tuned in. In their view, an accelerated start of the general election campaign will force Americans to reckon with Trump\u2019s potential return to the White House in a way they haven\u2019t yet. \u201cOur campaign has been saying for months that democracy is literally at stake and is what\u2019s on the ballot in this election. The American people deserve to hear from \u2026 two of the individuals who have a chance of being elected president of the United States, that are going to represent them on the world stage, that are going to be in charge of the economy that affects their life every day,\u201d Biden\u2019s principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said on CNN. \u201cPresident Biden deeply believes this. We have nothing to hide.\u201d An intense start to the summer For Biden, debate preparation will compete with a heavy campaign travel schedule and two foreign trips: to France for the 80th anniversary of the June 6 landings at Normandy and to Italy for the Group of 7 summit. Trump, meanwhile, continues to grapple with a swirl of legal issues, including the conclusion of his New York hush money trial. Klain, the president\u2019s former chief of staff, is planning to take a vacation from his job as AirBnB\u2019s top lawyer to help Biden prepare. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Biden\u2019s personal attorney Bob Bauer, who played Trump in previous debate practice session, would reprise his role. Trump and his campaign have made debating Biden a key part of their campaign. During rallies, Trump has brought an extra podium to the stage to mock Biden\u2019s refusal to answer Trump\u2019s calls to debate. Last month,\u00a0surrogates received talking points that encouraged them to say that \u201cPresident Trump is ready to debate anytime, anyplace, and anywhere\u201d and that \u201cAmericans deserve a full chance to see both candidates on the same stage before they start voting.\u201d Seeking to take control of the media narrative back around the debates, Trump posted on Truth Social that he would be accepting a third debate on Fox News, which the Biden campaign swiftly rejected. Both campaigns had little interest in debating Kennedy, the third party candidate who could siphon votes from both Biden and Trump. As CNN previously reported, in recent weeks Kennedy has gone from a perceived nuisance to a political problem that the Trump campaign is eager to swiftly extinguish. Biden, meanwhile, has sought to blunt Kennedy\u2019s appeal to Democrats by appearing with other members of the Kennedy family. \u201cIt is still too early to tell who RFK would take votes from,\u201d one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \u201cWe absolutely believe that its possible he could take away from Trump in a general election.\u201d Even after accepting in short order the invitations from CNN and ABC, neither campaign sounded entirely sure the debates would actually occur.\u00a0The skepticism reflected the logistical tripwires and political considerations that could still forestall an eventual debate. \u201cWe\u2019ll see Donald Trump on June 27th in Atlanta \u2013 if he shows up,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said. \u201cI wonder whether or not he shows up,\u201d Trump told radio interviewer Hugh Hewitt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/debates-joe-biden-donald-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The revelation\u00a0is\u00a0almost certain to prompt calls for Alito, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, to recuse himself from several high-profile cases pending before the court this year involving the election and subsequent attack on the US Capitol, including the blockbuster question of whether Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. The Times published a photo of the inverted flag, which it said was seen at the justice\u2019s home in Alexandria,\u00a0Virginia, on\u00a0January\u00a017, 2021. A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN, which has not independently verified the flag\u2019s use. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in an emailed statement to\u00a0the\u00a0Times. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d The upside-down flag became a symbol of the\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d\u00a0movement in the weeks and months following the election,\u00a0in which Trump\u2019s supporters falsely claimed that Biden\u2019s win was illegitimate due to\u00a0widespread fraud. The inverted flag was widely seen during the January 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol. The Times said it\u00a0was not clear how long the flag flew outside of Alito\u2019s home. The story will heap\u00a0further\u00a0scrutiny on the high court at a time when it is already facing considerable blowback.

Thomas recently accused his critics of \u201cnastiness\u201d and \u201clies\u201d in remarks to a judicial conference in Alabama. Last fall, in response to a series of revelations about travel accepted by Thomas and Alito, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for the first time.

Bob Menendez, who\u00a0has been charged\u00a0with acting as a foreign agent and taking bribes, has breast cancer, the New Jersey senator said Thursday. Nadine Menendez\u00a0is also charged in the case, and both have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez is set to go on trial in July, while the senator\u2019s trial began this week. \u201cNadine is suffering from Grade 3 breast cancer, which will require her to have mastectomy surgery. We are, of course, concerned about the seriousness and advanced stage of the disease. She will require follow-up surgery and possibly radiation treatment. We hope and pray for the best results,\u201d the senator said in a statement. Bob Menendez\u00a0has been charged\u00a0with acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and assisting the government of Qatar, all while taking bribes from several New Jersey businessmen.\u00a0He is being tried with two of his co-defendants: Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer, both of whom have also pleaded not guilty. At his trial this week, the senator\u2019s lawyer, Avi Weitzman, suggested to jurors during opening statements that many of the items the senator allegedly took as bribes \u2013\u00a0including gold bars\u00a0and a luxury car \u2013 were owned or obtained by his wife. Weitzman repeatedly argued that the couple have mostly led\u00a0\u201cseparate\u00a0lives\u201d and\u00a0\u201chad\u00a0separate finances,\u201d before spelling out a series of\u00a0\u201cfinancial\u00a0concerns that\u00a0(Nadine)\u00a0kept from Bob,\u201d whom Weitzman described as being smitten by a \u201cbeautiful\u00a0and tall, international woman.\u201d In explaining the gold bars found in Menendez\u2019s house by investigators, Weitzman again pointed the finger at the senator\u2019s wife, who, he said, kept the\u00a0\u201cfamily\u00a0gold.\u201d Nadine, Weitzman said, is from Lebanon, where keeping gold is \u201ccultural,\u201d\u00a0in part because of the region\u2019s historically unstable currencies, while adding that gifts of gold and silver are common for weddings and engagements. He also said the gold bars were found in Nadine\u2019s locked closet, which the senator didn\u2019t have access to. According to prosecutors, after search warrants were executed on Menendez\u2019s\u00a0home \u2013 where gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found \u2013 and elsewhere, the senator and his wife attempted to cover up the bribes by paying back the businessmen for the\u00a0luxury car\u00a0and a mortgage payment, claiming they were merely loans.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_jake-sullivan-israel-hamas-hostages", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan convened for the first time this week an in-person meeting of ambassadors and chiefs of mission representing countries whose citizens were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7, CNN has learned, as a ceasefire and hostages release deal remains stalled. Sullivan met with representatives from 17 nations:\u00a0Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom, according to a US official and senior administration official familiar with the meeting. Those 17 countries, along with the United States, have citizens whom Hamas took captive at the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The group discussed ideas to secure the release of the hostages in Gaza, with a particular focus on ways that they can speak more as a collective group in both public and private settings, according to the senior administration official. The meeting comes at a critical moment when the efforts to secure the release of hostages and Gaza ceasefire appear to have stalled once again. The ambassadors and chief of missions gathered with Sullivan brainstormed ways to exert pressure on the negotiating parties \u2013 including Israel, Egypt and Qatar \u2013 to return to the negotiating table and finalize a ceasefire agreement. One idea that was discussed was finding a way to speak as a collective voice to the United Nations, that official said. Those same 18 countries had released a statement in late April calling on the release of all hostages, warning that the fate of those individuals is \u201cof international concern\u201d and demanding that Hamas accept a ceasefire deal that Israel had put on the table at the time. \u201cWe emphasize that the deal on the table to release the hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza, that\u00a0would facilitate a surge of additional necessary humanitarian assistance to be delivered throughout Gaza, and lead to the credible end of hostilities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe reiterate our call on Hamas to\u00a0release the hostages, and let us end this crisis\u00a0so that collectively we can focus our efforts on bringing\u00a0peace and stability to the region.\u201d Sullivan last met with the families of American citizen hostages last week, something he has done numerous times since October 7. The idea of a \u201cworking group\u201d of sorts, consisting of the ambassadors and chief of missions representing the 18 countries that convened Wednesday, was borne out of that meeting with the American families, according to the senior administration official. The efforts from these 18 countries to exert collective pressure on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal comes as Biden is under tremendous pressure both at home and abroad as the war is now in its eighth month. While the US is working closely with these countries on finding a solution to free the hostages, the administration has also confronted deep concerns about the US policy toward the war and its continued support for Israel amid the high civilian death toll in Gaza. Multiple US diplomats have told CNN in recent weeks that they are consistently hearing those concerns from their counterparts abroad. \u201cThere is the growing concern that this is becoming a national security issue for the US,\u201d said one diplomat speaking about the anger coming from other countries. The Biden administration is juggling those frustrations and pressure it is receiving from various countries \u2014 including those in the Middle East \u2014 as it considers its policy in the region, diplomats said. Earlier this month, Biden told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that he would be willing to withhold additional offensive weapons from Israel if it chose to move forward with a major military operation into Rafah. Still, the White House has also been clear that the US remains a steadfast supporter of Israel, including its right to defend itself.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/jake-sullivan-israel-hamas-hostages/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_bob-menendez-trial-takeaways", "text": "The corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez is off to an explosive start, with prosecutors saying the New Jersey Democrat was \u201con the take\u201d from a cast of shady characters and lawyers for Menendez and his co-defendants all casting blame on the senator\u2019s wife, Nadine, for any potential crimes. Menendez, 70, has been charged\u00a0with acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and assisting the government of Qatar, all while taking bribes from several New Jersey businessmen.\u00a0He is being tried with Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. All three have pleaded not guilty. The allegations against Menendez, who stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u00a0after being indicted, have already put his long political career on the brink. He is not running for reelection in next month\u2019s Democratic primary but has said he would consider an independent bid should he be exonerated. After seating a jury Wednesday, the lawyers took centerstage. First up was the prosecution, which sought to take the complex allegations and spell them out in plain English \u2013 describing a series of \u201cschemes\u201d conducted by the defendants and led by a powerful US senator who was, as assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz put it, \u201con the take\u201d and using his wife as a \u201cgo-between\u201d with his partners. (Nadine Menendez is also charged and set to go on trial in July, separately from her husband.) The senator\u2019s lawyer, Avi Weitzman, painted a much different picture, depicting his client as a lovestruck naif, unaware of Nadine Menendez\u2019s financial dealings, debts and \u2013 most spectacularly \u2013 the contents of her closet in their home, where she kept gold bars allegedly given to her as bribes. Attorneys for Hana and Daibes followed a similar script. Like Weitzman, they also argued that the transactions between the three, and Menendez\u2019s wife, did not qualify as a crime \u2013 but were simply friendly gift-giving outside the context of the senator\u2019s official governmental powers. Here are five takeaways from the opening of the Bob Menendez trial: The Blame (Nadine) Game The most striking notes from the opening statements by the defendants\u2019 lawyers concerned Nadine Menendez and her role in the alleged crimes of her husband, Hana and Daibes. While Pomerantz, the prosecutor, described Nadine Menendez mostly as a conduit for the passage of bribes between the men, the senator\u2019s lawyer suggested she was a driving, deceitful figure. He told the story of a younger woman, who was \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201ctall\u201d and cosmopolitan. Nadine Menendez, Weitzman said, \u201chad financial concerns she kept\u201d from her husband and engaged in cash and gold exchanges of which he was not made aware. \u201cShe kept things from him,\u201d Weitzman told the jury. \u201cShe kept him in the dark.\u201d Weitzman brought a series of visual aids to underscore his point. One image from the couple\u2019s home showed Nadine Menendez\u2019s \u201clocked closet,\u201d a rambling walk-in with messy racks and clothes strewn on the floor, where the now infamous gold bars were found. The senator, Weitzman said, \u201cdid not know of the gold bars that existed in that closet.\u201d Later on, Weitzman showed another photo, this time of the senator\u2019s closet \u2013 a smaller space with neatly hung suit jackets and shirts. Nothing of interest, he stressed to the jury, had been found there. The lawyer for Hana, Lawrence Lustberg, also focused a large chunk of his opening statement on Nadine Menendez. She and his client \u201ccared about each other,\u201d Lustberg said, and frequently gave one another gifts \u2013 tequila, jewelry, watches. Their personal friendship, he explained, led to an ill-fated business arrangement. Nadine Menendez was supposed to help set up offices for Hana\u2019s halal company, but she \u2013 as Lustberg characterized it \u2013 not only failed to follow through but was essentially an absentee employee and did not want to work eight-hour days. The three checks from his company to her, each for $10,000, were not bribes, Lustberg insisted, but parting compensation to \u201cmake her good on it.\u201d Later Thursday morning, Bob Menendez announced in a statement that his wife has breast cancer and will undergo a mastectomy. Her trial had been delayed and split from her husband\u2019s owing to a previously disclosed \u201cserious medical\u00a0condition.\u201d The senator said the couple went public with the information in a bid for privacy, \u201cas a result of constant press inquiries and reporters following\u201d her. The defense drills down on the definition of \u2018crime\u2019 \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, told the jury in her opening remarks. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket. That is why we are here today. That is what this trial is all about.\u201d Lawyers for the senator, Hana and Daibes, again, offered a different take. On Thursday, Cesar de Castro, Daibes\u2019 lawyer, argued that prosecutors were distorting the nature of his client\u2019s relationship with Bob and Nadine Menendez. \u201cThe government wants you to assume, presume and infer the worst. It needs you to assume the worst in order for the evidence to make sense, and that tells you everything you need to know about this case,\u201d de Castro said. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing on which we can agree with the government: This case is about relationships.\u201d Hana\u2019s lawyer made a similar point. None of Hana\u2019s \u201cgifts\u201d to Nadine Menendez, \u201cbefore or after she met Mr. Menendez, were in exchange for anything,\u201d Lustberg said. \u201cWhat the government is trying to do here is criminalize gift-giving.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added, \u201chuman beings give each other gifts.\u201d Weitzman, the senator\u2019s lawyer, offered a broader criticism of the government\u2019s case, saying that prosecutors were conflating \u201cconstituent services\u201d with bribery and \u201cdiplomacy\u201d with allegations that he worked as a foreign agent. He argued that his client, in his advocacy for Hana on a range of issues, \u201cwas acting lawfully\u201d in his role as a US senator. \u201cYou might not like it,\u201d Weitzman told jurors, \u201cbut it is not a crime.\u201d A question of culture The gold bars discovered in the Menendez home, which the indictment says were given as bribes, has become the trial\u2019s trademark, headline-grabbing detail. In court, the defense attorneys in their opening statements sought to defuse the issue. Their message was consistent: The giving or receiving of gold or gold bars should not imply any criminal behavior. Especially so in this case, they argued, because both Nadine Menendez, originally from Lebanon, and Hana, an Egyptian immigrant, hail from a region where keeping gold is \u201ccultural,\u201d as Weitzman stated. Hana\u2019s lawyer said his client gave Nadine Menendez gifts aplenty, but he told the jury that they \u201cwill hear nothing about gold bars that are traceable to Wael Hana in the senator\u2019s home.\u201d They will be told, he said, that gold is a particular gift that people in the Middle East give each other. When Daibes\u2019 attorney had the stage, he accused prosecutors of unfairly concluding that the presence of gold suggests \u201csomething nefarious must be happening.\u201d The government\u2019s case, de Castro said, failed to acknowledge \u201cthat investing in precious metals\u201d is common, as is the giving of gold to friends. Boots, bags, boxes and jackets\u2026 of cash The\u00a0first witness called by prosecutors, FBI special agent Aristotelis Kougemitros, testified Thursday in new and remarkable detail about the nearly half a million dollars in cash,\u00a0alongside\u00a0gold jewelry and\u00a0more than a dozen\u00a0gold bars, that investigators seized from the Menendez home. Perhaps more interesting than the sum, though, was where it was all discovered: in a safe, in two black duffel bags, in several boxes and jackets, and stuffed in\u00a0two pairs of boots. All of it was captured in photographs shown to the court by prosecutors. All told, the FBI found $486,461 in cash, 11 one-ounce gold bars and a pair of one-kilogram gold bars. Inside Bob Menendez\u2019s home office, adorned with pictures of the senator, sports memorabilia and a small statue of the US Capitol atop his desk, a large black duffel bag found on a chair contained two smaller bags\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0Burberry bag filled with $100,000 and another black bag with $33,220 inside, Kougemitros said. Moving on to the\u00a0garage, the FBI found $4,300 in the pockets of a blue congressional jacket with the emblem of the US Senate woven on the top left and the senator\u2019s name engraved on the other side.\u00a0Other apparel concealing the cash included a tweed jacket containing $21,000, a black leather jacket filled with $6,000, another black jacket with $28,000 inside and a coat containing $8,000. And then there were the boots. One pair of red boots turned up by the FBI contained dozens of $100 bills. Inside another pair of boots lay $7,500, Kougemitros said. Pomerantz finished questioning Kougemitros\u00a0before the court adjourned for the day.\u00a0He will return to the stand for cross-examination Friday morning. Who\u2019s paying attention? (Not Republicans) Though the courtroom has been mostly full during the opening days of the Menendez trial, there has been a notable lack of hoopla outside on the streets of Lower Manhattan \u2013 especially in comparison with the circus-like atmosphere that has consumed former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, which is taking place a short walk away. That\u2019s welcome news, or a pleasing lack thereof, for national Democrats who might otherwise be facing tougher questions about Bob Menendez\u2019s alleged crimes and why, despite the damning nature of the indictment, he is still a member in good standing of the US Senate. (More than half of the Senate Democratic caucus has called on him to step down, including top ally Cory Booker, the junior senator from New Jersey. Menendez resigned as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but there has been no effort to remove him from office.) Menendez is up for reelection this year but will not run in the Democratic primary, which Rep. Andy Kim is poised to win in his bid to succeed the longtime incumbent. But with no serious Republican challenger in the race, and the national GOP pre-occupied with Trump \u2013 many of them making regular pilgrimages to New York to appear beside him \u2013 the Menendez case has mostly flown below the radar outside New York and New Jersey. In fact, the Democrat most likely to suffer politically could be the senator\u2019s son, Rob Menendez Jr., a first-term US House member from North Jersey. He is facing a primary challenge from Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, who has frequently invoked the incumbent\u2019s father during their tense campaign. \u201cHis\u00a0son also happens to be my primary opponent in NJ-08 and was handpicked by his father for his seat,\u201d Bhalla said in his call for the senator to resign earlier his year. \u201cThis culture of corruption and cronyism is bad for New Jersey and bad for America.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_cohen-trump-prison-what-matters", "text": "After watching his former fixer Michael Cohen testify against him on Tuesday, former President Donald Trump is expected to attend a fundraiser in New York City co-hosted by Charles Kushner, his son-in-law\u2019s father, whom he pardoned in 2020. The crimes for which Kushner went to prison \u2013 tax evasion and campaign finance violations \u2013 had nothing to do with Trump, but they were tawdry enough to compete with a porn star hush money trial. Trying to intimidate his sister from testifying before a grand jury, the elder Kushner set up a sort of rogue sting operation in which he meant to videotape his sister\u2019s brother with a prostitute and then send the tape to his sister. At least those are the broad outlines of the tale as told by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was then the US attorney for the state who prosecuted the case. Christie was ultimately denied a Trump Cabinet position after Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, opposed the idea. Now Christie, like Cohen, is a former Trump associate trying to take the former president down. RELATED: Read about Cohen\u2019s testimony in Trump\u2019s trial. Cohen is rare in the universe of Trump associates since he both turned on Trump and went to prison. Many of the other Trump aides and associates who faced jail eventually got pardons or clemency and still support the former president. Manafort still wants to help Paul Manafort is still in Trump\u2019s camp despite spending years in jail during a legal odyssey. Manafort ran Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign for a time, but then later, while Trump was president, Manafort \u2013 who made money as a foreign lobbyist \u2013 was convicted for federal tax evasion, among other things. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the US. Trump continually expressed sympathy for Manafort. Manafort served two years until he was released to home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic and was ultimately pardoned before Trump left office. He\u2019s back in the foreign lobbying business, although the optics of being involved in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign were apparently too much. Manafort recently backed away from a supporting role helping plan the Republican National Convention after media scrutiny over his involvement. Bannon faces jail for post-pardon activity Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House chief strategist turned right-wing provocateur, obtained a Trump pardon before he could be tried for allegedly defrauding donors of contributions intended to help build a wall on the US border with Mexico. Pardoning Bannon was one of Trump\u2019s final acts in office. Bannon associates in the scheme who did not receive pardons have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Trump\u2019s pardon helped Bannon avoid prosecution in the border wall scheme, but Bannon may yet go to prison. He was the subject of a rare prosecution by the Department of Justice for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Bannon ignored summons to testify before the now-disbanded House committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. A federal appeals court recently rejected his attempt to further delay his four-month sentence, and prosecutors this week asked for Bannon\u2019s sentence to be imposed. Bannon hosts a widely downloaded podcast that is supportive of Trump. Another former top Trump aide, Peter Navarro, has already reported to prison after his conviction for contempt of Congress. Trump can\u2019t help Bannon or Navarro now, since he\u2019s not currently president, but he has already promised to use pardon power to help people convicted of crimes related to January 6, a riot committed by his supporters. Stone, Flynn avoided jail Trump already has a notable history of helping supporters when he is able. He commuted the sentence of his longtime friend Roger Stone, the political operative who was convicted by a jury of, among other things, obstructing the Russia investigation. Trump also issued a wide-ranging pardon to retired Gen. Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser who was charged with lying to investigators. Flynn had entered a guilty plea and then tried to rescind it, and the yearslong legal saga hung over Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump issued the Flynn pardon shortly after losing the 2020 presidential election. Flynn is now an avowed QAnon conspiracy theorist, but Trump has said he could bring him back in a second Trump administration. Trump\u2019s longtime CFO is back on Rikers Trump also can\u2019t help another lieutenant, Allen Weisselberg, who stayed loyal. Weisselberg already served one monthslong jail sentence on Rikers Island for a yearslong tax scheme. But then he was found to have lied during a deposition in the civil fraud trial in which Trump was found to have inflated his wealth to get favorable loans. For that perjury, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to different state charges and is now serving another five months at Rikers Island jail. Even if Trump is reelected, a president cannot use his pardon power to absolve state charges. Jonathan Karl of ABC News has reported that Trump was actively considering a pardon for Cohen around the time the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s house in 2018. Cohen ultimately spent weeks in solitary confinement for his tax and campaign finance crimes, something he has said was retribution by Trump \u2013 although a lawsuit Cohen filed making that allegation was dismissed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-prison-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_supreme-court-cfpb-thomas", "text": "The\u00a0Supreme Court\u00a0ruled Thursday that the federal watchdog created in response to the 2008 financial meltdown may continue to operate in its current form, brushing aside claims from the payday lending industry that could have severely jeopardized years of consumer-friendly banking regulations. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion for a 7-2 court. The ruling is\u00a0a\u00a0victory for the Biden administration, which argued that a lower court\u2019s decision invalidating the\u00a0Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s funding would have gutted years of popular regulations on mortgages, car loans and credit cards. Congress created the bureau in 2010 to protect consumers from financial scams. Republicans have long been skeptical of the agency, originally envisioned by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The payday lending groups sued over a 2017 bureau rule that prohibited attempts to withdraw payments from accounts after two consecutive tries failed due to insufficient funds. Repeated withdrawal attempts can subject borrowers to extra banking fees. While most of the industry\u2019s claims failed in lower courts, the New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit of Appeals accepted one of them: The appeals court ruled that the agency\u2019s funding violated a founding principle that Congress alone has the power of the purse. Because of that, the conservative appeals court tossed the payday lending rule. The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court in 2022. Rather than finance the CFPB through annual appropriations, Congress specified that it receive funding from the combined earnings of the Federal Reserve system each year, up to about $600 million. That unusual structure was created to safeguard the bureau\u2019s independence from the whims of whatever party controls Congress. \u201cAlthough there may be other constitutional checks on Congress\u2019 authority to create and fund an administrative agency, specifying the source and purpose is all the control the Appropriations Clause requires,\u201d Thomas wrote. CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck said the ruling is another instance of the high court not endorsing controversial opinions from the 5th Circuit. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is a rather decisive repudiation of the 5th Circuit, which embraced a novel constitutional theory that would\u2019ve had potentially cataclysmic ramifications,\u201d said Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cNot for the first time this term, and not for the last, it\u2019s a sign that the New Orleans-based appeals court is too far to the right for even this Supreme Court.\u201d In dissent, Justice Samuel Alito said that the majority\u2019s opinion gave far too much leeway to the agency. \u201cIn sum, the CFPB\u2019s unprecedented combination of funding features affords it the very kind of financial independence that the appropriations clause was designed to prevent,\u201d Alito wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that the CFPB enjoys a degree of financial autonomy that a Stuart king would envy.\u201d Four years ago, at the end of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court sided against the bureau, finding that its leadership structure violated the principle of separation of powers because the president was restricted from removing the director. That prohibition was also put in place to shield the agency from partisan politics.

{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_qualifications-for-june-27-cnn-presidential-debate", "text": "The stage is set for the first in-person showdown of the 2024 election cycle between President Joe Biden and his opponent and predecessor, Donald Trump. Both candidates have accepted an invitation from CNN to debate on June 27 in the network\u2019s Atlanta studios. Some aspects \u2013 including the lack of a studio audience \u2013 will be a departure from previous debates. CNN has set several parameters for candidates to qualify for the debate, which will be hosted by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. All participating debaters must meet the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president. Both Biden and Trump meet those requirements, as do Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein, who are running on non-major-party tickets. Participants must file a formal statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. All five have done so. Candidates must also appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Biden and Trump will meet those requirements, but they make the others less likely to be able to participate - though, in Kennedy\u2019s case, it\u2019s not an impossibility. Kennedy is on the ballot in only five states, though the campaign says it has gathered enough signatures to make it on the ballots of several more. West\u2019s campaign says he has secured ballot access for six states. Kennedy has been averaging about 13% in recent national polling. West and Stein have been averaging at about 3%. Debaters must also agree to accept the rules and format of the debate. Trump and Biden have agreed to do so. Both Trump and Biden have also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Prosecutors will seek to build on his testimony when he returns to the stand Tuesday to nail down their case that the ex-president broke the law by falsifying financial records to hide the pay-off in the culmination of a scheme to mislead voters. All that will be a curtain raiser for what is looming as a savage cross-examination by the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s attorney, designed to shatter the reputation of Cohen, expose him as a liar and punish him for turning on his ex-boss. The biggest question before Monday was whether prosecutors had laid a prior foundation of corroborating evidence to which they could connect Cohen\u2019s testimony and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump acted criminally. \u201cI think they have it,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, citing fulsome evidence \u2013 such as logs of calls, including between Trump and Cohen, about the proposed payment and the lawyer\u2019s reimbursement, which prosecutors say led to the falsified financial documents. \u201cAs of today, it holds together.\u201d Trump has pleaded not guilty, and no one can say how a jury will interpret events at trial until the fateful moment when the foreperson delivers a verdict. But former New York prosecutor Bernarda Villalona said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d that Cohen, from his delivery to his eye contact with the prosecutor, had been \u201cexcellent\u201d on the stand and helped the prosecution. \u201cThey finally provided that link that Donald Trump authorized these payments and the payments were for the purposes of affecting that campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cMichael Cohen did deliver. \u2026 but we have to see how he stands up to cross examination.\u201d Given Cohen\u2019s past, including a conviction for lying to Congress, and his thwarted hopes of a job in Trump\u2019s administration offering a potential motive for revenge, the cross examination will be critical, said David Schoen, who represented Trump during his second impeachment. \u201cI think that they (the prosecution) feel he is a make-or-break witness. I think in real terms, he probably is,\u201d Schoen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cThis case is going to turn in large part on the cross-examination of Mr. Cohen. That ought to be a dream for a half-way competent lawyer.\u201d A pivotal day The most critical day of the trial so far saw the presumptive Republican nominee come face to face with Cohen, who says he squashed scandals and cleaned up busted business deals as his boss\u2019 ruthless fixer. It was another unfathomable episode in a 2024 election season that has been ensnared by Trump\u2019s legal quagmire but that could still end with him back in the White House. And while the courtroom action Monday will play a pivotal role in how the case turns out, there is a wider audience given how Trump\u2019s defense has morphed into a campaign rationale. It\u2019s too early to assess how voters might process a conviction or acquittal or whether damaging new revelations about his conduct will sway an electorate by now numb to scandals that would have doomed a normal candidate years ago. But fresh New York Times/Siena polls showing Trump leading President Joe Biden in multiple swing states underscore his very real hopes of a non-consecutive second term. And Cohen\u2019s descriptions Monday of the ex-president\u2019s way of doing business added to growing evidence that a second Trump administration would likely pose an even greater threat to the rule of law than his first spell in the White House. Trump is barred from publicly slamming Cohen and what he sees as his treachery because of a gag order imposed by a judge who has threatened jail if he won\u2019t comply following 10 previous violations. But the former president\u2019s tirade outside the courtroom Monday was even more irate than usual, as he lashed out at Judge Juan Merchan and bitterly claimed he was a victim of political victimization. \u201cThe whole world is laughing now at the New York, weaponized, legal system,\u201d he claimed. In a sense, testimony from Cohen \u2013 who has written that he was drawn to Trump before he ran for president because of his aura and fame \u2013 is a lesson in the contortions and legally questionable choices often faced by those in the ex-president\u2019s orbit. But there is no shortage of Republicans seeking to join him. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a vice presidential prospect, and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville joined Trump outside the courtroom Monday morning, strutting like a posse behind a sheriff and reflecting his undimmed power in the GOP. Vance served as Trump\u2019s ungagged mouthpiece, seeking to discredit Cohen and showing his own credentials as a Trump defender as the ex-president mulls a list of running mates. \u201cDoes any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?\u201d the Ohio Republican asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d he said, defending a presumptive GOP nominee who tried to overthrow a free and fair election in 2020. How the Trump and Cohen double act fractured During hours of testimony, the former president sat with his eyes often closed as Cohen, now on a journey of redemption after years of service to Trump ended in his own jail term, detailed a scheme to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had a sexual liaison with the then-reality television star and real estate magnate. (Trump denies the affair.) Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger spent a painstaking day slowly taking Cohen through his former role at the Trump Organization and his commitment to protecting his boss, with Cohen even going on television to lie and organizing schemes to silence alleged claims against Trump from other women. Hoffinger sought to establish that the payment to Daniels did take place, that Trump told Cohen to do it, that Cohen made the payment using a home equity line of credit to disguise it from his wife and that he expected to be reimbursed. Hoffinger also drew Cohen into testifying that the real reason Trump was worried about Daniels\u2019 claims \u2014 which emerged shortly after an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape came to light in 2016 in which he boasted about grabbing female genitals \u2014 was to protect his campaign rather than, as the defense will argue, to spare his family embarrassment. Cohen said that Trump told him: \u201cWomen are going to hate me. \u2026 Guys may think it\u2019s cool, but this is going to be a disaster for the campaign.\u201d He said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t even thinking about Melania,\u201d referring to the former first lady. \u201cThis was all about the campaign.\u201d Cohen also testified that Trump said he would not be on the market for long, implying he could get another wife quickly. The ex-president smirked and shook his head after that comment. Throughout his testimony, Cohen said he always kept Trump up to speed with his activities. \u201cEverything required Mr. Trump\u2019s sign-off,\u201d he said, noting the Daniels payment was no exception. \u201cHe stated to me that he had spoken to some friends, some individuals, smart people, and \u2018That it\u2019s $130,000. You\u2019re a billionaire, just pay it. There\u2019s no reason to keep this thing out there so do it.\u2019 He expressed to me, \u2018just do it.\u2019\u201d Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors say this was done to hide monthly reimbursements Cohen received in 2017 \u2014 after his boss became president \u2014 for the hush money payment he made to Daniels. In an apparent bid to neutralize an expected effort by the defense to argue that Cohen is lying because he bears a grudge against Trump, the prosecution asked him about his anger when his annual bonus was cut by two-thirds in December 2016. He testified that he was \u201cpissed off.\u201d Shortly afterwards, he went to Trump\u2019s then-chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, to discuss the repayment of the $130,000 he had paid Daniels. Cohen also testified that he was disappointed not to be considered for Trump\u2019s first White House chief of staff. His testimony was quite the reversal for a man who previously wrote that he became a \u201cthug\u201d to carry out Trump\u2019s wishes and who said Monday of the client who spurned him: \u201cThe only thing that was on my mind was to accomplish the task to make him happy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/politics/cohen-trump-hush-money-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "politics"}}
