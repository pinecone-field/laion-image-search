Salimdzhon Nasriddinov, 53, and Nikolay Goltsev, 38, could each face up to 20 years for conspiracy to commit export control violations in connection with a global procurement scheme on behalf of sanctioned Russian entities, including some affiliated with the Russian military, prosecutors from the US attorney\u2019s office in the Eastern District of New York said Tuesday. \u201cThe defendants shipped millions of dollars of U.S. electronics critical to the missiles and drones Russia uses\u00a0to attack Ukraine, and they now face U.S. prison time for their scheme,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a news release. She added, \u201cAs Russia continues to wage its unjust war of aggression against Ukraine, the Department remains\u00a0committed to holding accountable those who fuel\u00a0Putin\u2019s war machine.\u201d Goltsev and Nasriddinov are set to be sentenced December 10 and December 11, respectively. \u201cMr.\u00a0Goltsev\u00a0has availed himself of a very favorable plea agreement which puts him in the best possible position for sentencing and moving on with his life,\u201d Todd A. Spodek, a lawyer for Goltsev, said in a statement. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Nasriddinov. A co-defendant in the case, Kristina Puzyreva, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the export scheme, prosecutors said, and she now awaits sentencing. Prosecutors say the trio used two Brooklyn companies, SH Brothers Inc. and SN\u00a0Electronics Inc., \u201cto unlawfully source, purchase, and ship millions of dollars in dual-use electronics from U.S. manufacturers to sanctioned end users in Russia,\u201d according to the news release. Nasriddinov and Goltsev would use the companies to buy electronic components from US manufacturers and distributors to be shipped to Brooklyn and from there to front companies abroad \u2014 including in Turkey, Hong Kong, India, China and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 which then would be rerouted to Russia, prosecutors say. In all, they provided more than $7 million worth of material support to the Kremlin, according to Homeland Security Investigations New York special agent in charge Ivan J. Arvelo, coordinating more than 300 shipments of restricted electronics that were used on the Russian battlefield. Authorities seized around $1.68 million dollars in connection with the scheme, prosecutors say. The components the trio sourced have been found in seized Russian weapons that included guided missiles, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and battle tanks, with some of the components needed for Russia\u2019s precision-guided weapons systems being used against Ukraine, according to prosecutors. \u201cThe defendants were aware of the potential military applications of the electronics that they exported to Russia,\u201d prosecutors said in the release. \u201cIn a Feb. 23, 2023, message, Nasriddinov wrote to Goltsev, \u2018Happy Defender of the Fatherland,\u2019 referring the holiday in Russia and parts of the former Soviet Union celebrating those who served in the armed forces,\u201d prosecutors said. \u201cGoltsev responded, \u2018happy holiday to you too my friend, we are defending it in the way that we can [smile emoji].\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/russian-electronics-weapons-guilty-plea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The initial decision to halt a shipment of both 2,000-pound\u00a0and 500-pound\u00a0bombs was due to US concerns about Israel using the heavy munitions\u00a0\u2013 specifically the larger 2,000-pound bombs \u2013 in their Rafah operation.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fact-check-trump-biden-vacation-homes", "text": "Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Tuesday that President Joe Biden has more homes than Trump does and that Biden has homes in four expensive holiday destinations. At a campaign rally in Florida, Trump argued that Biden has spent excessive time on vacation during his presidency. \u201cAnd mansions are in \u2013 think of this \u2013 here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s been a politician all his life. He\u2019s got homes in the Virgin Islands, Nantucket, Lake Tahoe, Kiawah Island. I mean, where the hell did they get all this money, Byron?\u201d Trump said, speaking to Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. \u201cHe\u2019s got more homes than I do. What the hell is going on with him?\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claims are false. First, Biden does not have homes in any of the four places Trump claimed he does; rather, Biden has stayed at others\u2019 homes in those places. Second, Trump owns more homes than Biden does. Biden owns two houses, both in Delaware, and there is no mystery about how he afforded them. Biden\u2019s homes Biden\u2019s primary home, in a suburb of Wilmington, Delaware, is a 6,850-square-foot house Biden and his wife Jill Biden built on a lot they bought for $350,000 in 1996, 23 years into his tenure as a US senator representing Delaware. Biden\u2019s vacation home is a beach house near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, that he and Jill Biden bought for about $2.7 million in 2017. They made the purchase after they signed a lucrative three-book deal earlier that year as private citizens following his vice presidency. The Bidens disclosed the book income in tax filings they released to the public in 2019. The filings showed they had earned a total of about $15.6 million in 2017 and 2018. About $13.3 million of that was from the book deal and related paid speeches. Biden\u2019s vacations\u00a0at others\u2019 homes  As president, Biden has stayed at the homes of wealthy associates in the four vacation destinations Trump mentioned. Biden does not have his own homes in any of them. Biden has stayed at a US Virgin Islands home owned by Democratic donors Bill and Connie Neville, whom the White House has described as his friends; at a Nantucket, Massachusetts home owned by private equity titan and longtime friend David Rubenstein; at a Lake Tahoe-area Nevada home owned by prominent Democratic donor Tom Steyer; and a Kiawah Island, South Carolina home owned by campaign donor Maria Allwin. The White House said in 2023 that the Biden family was renting the Steyer home for \u201cfair market value,\u201d and Politico reported in 2021 that the Bidens were renting the Rubenstein home, but the White House has not released specifics on the financial arrangements related to their stays at the four properties; it\u2019s possible that some of the stays have been free. Regardless, Trump\u2019s assertion that they are Biden\u2019s own properties is wrong. Trump\u2019s homes\u00a0 There is no comprehensive current list of the homes Trump owns, and it can be hard to separate his personal home ownership from his business interests \u2013 for example, to decide if unsold condominiums in Trump developments should count as Trump homes. But it is clear by any reasonable measure that the billionaire real estate businessman owns more homes than Biden\u2019s two. Trump\u2019s primary residence is at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. He continues to own his former primary residence, a triplex penthouse at his Trump Tower in New York City. He also has a mansion on more than 200 acres in the suburbs of New York City, a private villa at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, and an estate on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin that his company has tried to sell for years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-vacation-homes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_chicago-donors-fundraiser-convention", "text": "Democratic donors are deeply concerned about President Joe Biden\u2019s viability as a candidate as the party continues to wrestle with the path forward \u2014 and holding back big checks, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. \u201cEverything is frozen because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen. Everyone is in wait and see mode,\u201d one Democratic strategist told CNN, noting that donors are hyper-focused on what Biden is doing, including interviews and his news conference Thursday. Donors often operate behind the scenes and, according to sources, have grown increasingly anxious about Biden\u2019s candidacy following his halting debate performance last month. And on Wednesday, George Clooney, who had been among Biden\u2019s biggest supporters and donors in Hollywood, took the remarkable step of publicly calling for him to bow out of the presidential race. The Clooney op-ed, the strategist said, is \u201cgoing to sting.\u201d Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments on MSNBC Wednesday morning also raised fresh doubts and ricocheted among donors. Pelosi\u00a0told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d \u201cMajor donations have slowed remarkably since the debate,\u201d a Democratic fundraiser told CNN, adding that small dollar donations are proceeding at pace, but noted the campaign is too vast to live on small donations alone. A Biden campaign official told CNN that July was the best start to any month ever for grassroots fundraising. They added that several donors maxed out in the past few days and that the Biden-Harris campaign had several fundraisers across the country this month alone. Earlier this week, Biden tried to reassure donors in a call, maintaining that he\u2019s staying in the race and arguing he\u2019s still the best candidate to beat Republican rival Donald Trump. \u201cMy one job is to beat Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u00a0said, according to one of the participants on the\u00a0call, who said\u00a0Biden\u00a0thanked\u00a0donors and renewed his pledge to keep the fight alive. But that hasn\u2019t calmed everyone\u2019s nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough go,\u201d one source familiar with the fundraising situation said. \u201cIn the short term, the money is a challenge, but it is a fluid situation.\u201d The incoming money is \u201cdrying up,\u201d another source close to fundraising efforts told CNN, describing\u00a0donors as very, very frustrated, and very, very worried. That\u2019s already come through in fundraisers held after the debate: A fundraiser held at New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s home following the debate raised $3.7 million \u2013 less than half of the haul raised at a pre-debate fundraiser held at the Virginia home of former Gov. Terry McAuliffe the week before the debate. Top Chicago donors halting convention fundraising lunch for high-dollar contributors Meanwhile, organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. In the immediate wake of Biden\u2019s debate performance, organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed given the continued erosion of support for Biden\u2019s candidacy. The event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, was expected to rally support among the party\u2019s loyal and well-heeled locals in a show of support for the big event in their backyard. While the lunch itself was expected to bring in less than $1 million for the campaign, the mood of the participants \u2014 many of whom had given millions to Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign and associated entities \u2014 serves as a warning sign among some deep-blue corners of the donor class. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule. Nearly two weeks after the debate, some Democratic donors continue to sound public warnings that their party could lose the White House in November if Biden remains the nominee and say they are increasingly concerned about his dug-in defiance. The president has insisted he will remain in the race and expressed frustration\u00a0with \u201cthe elites\u201d calling for him to withdraw from the race. Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood screenwriter and producer\u00a0who recently called on fellow Democratic donors\u00a0to withhold contributions until Biden steps down, told CNN in an email Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cpretty steadfast\u201d in that view. \u201cI maintain that Joe Biden is an excellent president, and I\u2019m saddened that the intraparty language is attack/defend/retreat instead of a thoughtful and considered debate about where we are and how to get to where we need to be,\u201d Lindelof said. \u201cI think the characterization that the only folks asking for that conversation are \u2018elites\u2019 ignores the polling and the tens of millions of Americans who have been saying they were deeply concerned about our nominee for awhile now,\u201d he added. Maggie Kulyk, a Democratic donor who runs a wealth-management firm, said her view that Biden needs to step down is shared by \u201cpeople I talk to all the time \u2013 friends, clients, etc. \u201cTo a person, they all say the same thing, that he shouldn\u2019t be at the top of the ticket,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cWashington politicians or someone with some leverage needs to grow a spine and tell the truth that\u2019s in plain sight,\u201d she added, that Biden is dealing with \u201cobvious cognitive issues.\u201d \u201cThis sort of waiting around for (Biden) to make a big stumble again as an excuse, to me, seems ludicrous,\u201d Kulyk said. \u201cThe debate was the thing. We saw it.\u201d Kulyk sits on the board of the Women Donors Network but said she was not speaking on behalf of the contributor group. Democrats stunned by last 24 hours Many anxious Democrats who have been holding their breath and waiting to see what happens to Biden\u2019s reelection campaign have been stunned by the past 24 hours. One widely shared view had been that everything was likely to come to a head after this week\u2019s NATO conference that the US is hosting just blocks away from the White House. Instead, devastating headlines have come out in rapid succession as Biden has been juggling various engagements on the global stage. \u201cThis seems to be moving more rapidly than I thought,\u201d one senior Democrat said. The news of the canceled fundraiser in Chicago came hours after Clooney called on the president to bow out of the race, just weeks after the actor headlined a major fundraiser for the president\u2019s reelection campaign. Clooney wrote that the Biden that he saw during a June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \u201cwas not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020.\u201d \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney added, referencing Biden\u2019s faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN. Biden\u2019s team is currently planning to host fundraisers in Austin, Denver, and two in California \u2014 one in Laguna Beach and another in Northern California \u2014 in July, according to a source familiar with the plans. Donors elsewhere in the country\u00a0have told CNN\u00a0their events are on hold until Biden\u2019s path is clearer. John Morgan, a Florida trial attorney and longtime Biden supporter, had been working with the campaign to host a fundraiser in the state likely in early September, but he said this week that the event is \u201call up in the air.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even bother them,\u201d he said\u00a0about\u00a0reaching out to campaign officials\u00a0on\u00a0the status of the event. \u201cI\u2019m not going to call them because they have bigger fish to fry than an event in Florida in September. They\u2019ve got to get past all the naysayers.\u201d For his part, Morgan said he remains committed to backing Biden and is willing to hold a fundraiser \u201conly if he\u2019s the candidate.\u201d \u201cSome of the elite donor class is cutting and running. That\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Morgan said. One long-time Democratic fundraiser said it\u2019s too soon to tell whether Biden is doing enough to stem the concerns of contributors but was relieved that there had not been a \u201csnowball\u201d of elected officials in Washington calling on Biden to quit the race this week once they returned from their July 4\u00a0recess. That said, the person added, \u201cI\u2019ve not made any calls or requests (for donations) in the last week and a half \u2026 because he\u2019s got to let some of this die down.\u201d For its part, the Biden campaign has touted a flood of recent online financial support and the substantial infrastructure it already has built in battleground states to argue it will have the ground game and resources to compete effectively this fall. The campaign said it raised $38 million in the four days after the debate, including $30 million from grassroots contributors. Additionally, Peter Lowy, a former retail executive, on Monday delivered the maximum $929,600 contribution to Biden\u2019s joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee, according to the campaign. In a statement, Lowy said \u201cthere is no question about the country\u2019s success\u201d during Biden\u2019s tenure. \u201cThe economy is strong. Unemployment is near historic lows, more than 15 million jobs have been created, the S&P 500 is at an historic high and inflation is now decreasing,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on all of these facts and based on my interactions with the President, when he announced his plan to run for reelection, I was totally supportive. I supported him then, and I support him today.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

Vermont Sen. Peter Welch became the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside as the nominee in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday. Just\u00a010\u00a0congressional Democrats have\u00a0publicly\u00a0called for Biden to step aside, but a larger number are operating under a premise that Biden may still be deliberating, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying Wednesday, \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\u201d The comments made by Pelosi, who is known for her precision, confused some members but also\u00a0provided an opening for others, according to conversations with multiple lawmakers and aides. After a group of California House Democrats met in the Capitol Wednesday, many emerged echoing a similar sentiment. \u201cThe president has got to decide what he is going to do,\u201d Democratic Rep. Scott Peters told CNN. When presented with the reality that Biden has stated he plans to remain in the race, Peters responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think the week is over. I think that as more and more data comes in, he\u2019s got to keep his eyes open.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman told CNN that just because Biden has said he made his decision to remain in the race, that does not mean it is final. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Huffman, who has raised concerns about Biden, told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe all understand this as President Biden\u2019s decision. I will just say that good leaders always continue to consider new information and changed circumstances and sometimes make different decisions informed by that. So, this is going to be fluid for a little while.\u201d Even Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina who is a strident Biden supporter, told reporters Wednesday\u00a0he \u201chas no idea\u201d if Biden\u2019s decision to stay in the race is final. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him.\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia, told CNN Wednesday when pressed on if he really thought Biden could change his mind, \u201cif you can\u2019t change your mind, you can\u2019t change anything,\u201d adding he has always believed \u201crational people do the right thing.\u201d The high stakes meetings on Capitol Hill\u00a0that kicked off on\u00a0Tuesday also did little to resolve Democratic divisions over Biden\u2019s future. House members leaving a nearly two-hour meeting at the DNC argued they were still working through the process, and various caucuses within the Democratic party \u2014 including lawmakers who represent the most competitive districts \u2014\u00a0have held private meetings with Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has promised to relay concerns to the White House. New York Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, reversed course on Wednesday and went public with his concerns that Biden remaining at the top of the ticket could hurt Democrats\u2019 chances of winning back the House of Representatives. Torres said in a statement Wednesday that \u201cthere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d when two days prior had called the intra-party controversy \u201cself-destructive.\u201d Crystalizing his criticism, Torres said in a statement to CNN \u201cif we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d In just the last two days, Democratic Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Pat Ryan of New York have called on Biden to step aside, bringing the total number of congressional Democrats to make public statements asking Biden to withdraw to 10. During a Senate lunch Tuesday,\u00a0three Democratic senators \u2013 Colorado\u2019s Michael Bennet, Montana\u2019s Jon Tester and Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown - expressed concerns to their colleagues that they didn\u2019t think Biden could beat Trump in a rematch in November. Bennet later on Tuesday became the first Democratic senator to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. On Thursday, the Biden campaign will dispatch top campaign officials\u00a0including\u00a0senior Biden advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, and Biden Campaign Chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon to brief senate Democrats during a special meeting, a sign that questions about Biden\u2019s future are still lingering. Democrats both publicly and privately\u00a0contend that one of the challenges of the moment for them is that they need to see more of the President. \u201cThe President has to be more active, He has to be out there in unscripted situations, answering questions, interacting with voters in order to demonstrate that the debate performance was an anomaly,\u201d independent Maine Sen. Angus King said. Many members told CNN that they will be watching Biden very carefully for the remainder of the week,\u00a0including a high-profile press conference he is scheduled to host on Thursday at NATO. The number three Democrat in the House, Rep. Pete Aguilar of California,\u00a0said Tuesday,\u00a0\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d referring to the upcoming events. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how this plays out,\u201d Democratic Rep.

Ritchie Torres sounded a more dire tune. than he had earlier this week. \u201cThere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d Torres wrote on social media, beseeching Democrats to dispassionately study the \u201cthe cold hard numbers.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re going to choose a particular path, we should be clear-eyed about its consequences.\u201d In a comment to CNN, Torres added, \u201cIf we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d New York Democrats have struggled at the congressional and local level since 2020. Democrats on Long Island were nearly wiped out in municipal elections in 2021 \u2013 a sign of things to come. Gov. Kathy Hochul only defeated former GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin by a little more than six points in 2022, the same year Republicans flipped four seats on Long Island and the Hudson Valley. In 2023, Democrats lost control of additional local strongholds in the suburbs. \u201cWe have a Democratic governor, who a lot of people see as weak and ineffective. Whether that\u2019s fair or not, that\u2019s how she\u2019s perceived. And you have a mayor who is seen as weakened by the death of a thousand cuts with these little scandals that keep coming,\u201d said Laura Curran, the former Nassau County executive who was ousted by a Republican in 2021. \u201cSo who\u2019s the standard bearer of the Democratic brand in New York state? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Most New York Democrats are looking to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2013 both of whom remain popular and powerful \u2013 for guidance. Chris Coffey,\u00a0the New York-based CEO and partner of Tusk Strategies, said anxious Democrats should watch them closely in the coming days and weeks. \u201cHakeem Jeffries is singularly focused, or at least has been until this debate, on winning back some of the swing districts that New York Dems lost in 2022,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cIf Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer are really anxious enough that they think they\u2019re lost in the swing districts, my guess is they would then put some pressure on the president to drop out.\u201d Both Schumer and Jeffries have publicly backed Biden, but, as leaders of their conferences with significant down-ballot concerns, have tried to steer clear of thornier questions. \u201cOver the last few days, the members of the House Democratic Caucus have had conversations that are candid, constructive and clear-eyed about the path forward, which primarily includes doing everything we can to make sure that we take back the majority in November of this year,\u201d Jeffries told reporters on Wednesday on his way into a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. Asked if Biden is the best candidate for the job, Jeffries said his position had not changed. \u201cMy conversations right now are focused on the caucus,\u201d he said, \u201cand making sure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard.\u201d Jeffries\u00a0has told Democrats in meetings this week, including on Wednesday morning, that he is going to relay the concerns he is hearing from lawmakers to Biden, two sources familiar\u00a0told\u00a0CNN. Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York Democratic Party, offered a rosier picture \u2013 at least in his state. \u201cWe need support and we\u2019re getting it in key congressional races that are competitive. So we\u2019re getting that attention, finally. They haven\u2019t had that support,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cWe feel good about it.\u201d But he did warn that the ongoing drama over Biden\u2019s fate could, on its own, hamper Democrats in swing districts. \u201cThe longer we keep the focus on this issue and away from Trump and the Republican extremists, the more difficult a campaign this is,\u201d Jacobs said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_alexandria-ocasio-cortez-impeachment-supreme-court", "text": "Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has introduced articles of impeachment against conservative Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas over their failure to disclose gifts they have received while serving on the court \u2013 a messaging move that will surely fail in the GOP-controlled House. \u201cJustice Thomas and Alito\u2019s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. \u201cAnd their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis.\u201d \u201cCongress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,\u201d she said. This is the latest example of House Democrats \u2013 led by some of their highest-profile members \u2013 prioritizing the Supreme Court in their campaign year messaging.\u00a0They\u2019ve previously signaled that, if they regain control of the House, they\u2019d use the power of the gavel to investigate alleged ethical lapses by the justices. Alongside Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a panel on Supreme Court ethics last month that previewed how House Democrats would ramp up investigations into the justices should they gain a Democratic majority in the chamber this fall. Raskin is not a co-sponsor to the New York Democrat\u2019s impeachment articles, but several other progressives joined her in introducing the articles. They include Reps. Barbara Lee of California, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Delia Ramirez of Illinois, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Jasmine Crockett of Texas. Other legislation attempting to regulate the Supreme Court through an enforceable ethics code or expanding the number of justices on the bench has been introduced in the House. The bills aimed at the high court have little chance of success while Republicans control the House and can block legislation in the Senate with the filibuster. Still, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s impeachment attempt is the most\u00a0aggressive proposal by Democrats to crack down on a Supreme Court they believe is engaging in\u00a0inappropriate\u00a0conduct. Earlier this week, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse\u00a0of Rhode Island\u00a0and Ron Wyden\u00a0of Oregon\u00a0called for Attorney General Merrick Garland to\u00a0appoint\u00a0a special counsel to investigate whether the hospitality Thomas received from his wealthy friends violated various laws. Thomas has come under fire for failing to report on annual financial disclosures luxury travel enjoyed by him and his wife that was bankrolled by a GOP megadonor. It was also revealed last year that Alito flew on a private jet in 2008 owned by a hedge fund manager who had connections to cases before the court. Both justices have denied running afoul of the ethics and financial disclosure protocols followed by the justices. Last year, under intense public and congressional pressure, the Supreme Court\u00a0rolled out its own code of ethics, but the court leaves it to the individual justices to police his or her own compliance.

Ron DeSantis, a onetime Donald Trump political foe turned endorser, is now expected to speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week despite previously being given no role at the event, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. It is unclear which night DeSantis is expected to deliver his remarks, the source added. The decision came shortly after CNN reported Tuesday that DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, another Trump primary rival, had been left out of the program, sparking backlash from their supporters. A senior DeSantis official told CNN the governor\u2019s team had always been told he would have a speaking slot at the convention and had not been told differently. A separate source familiar with the matter, however, said a DeSantis speaking role came into serious consideration within past 24 hours. NBC News was first to report on DeSantis\u2019 role at the convention. Trump and DeSantis, who fiercely attacked one another during the GOP presidential primary, have made an effort to put their personal history behind them in recent months. DeSantis, who ended his presidential campaign in January and immediately endorsed Trump, met with the former president in Florida in April and told donors and supporters he would help fundraise for Trump. Trump\u2019s team is also currently discussing whether to invite Haley to the convention next week. On Tuesday, Haley announced that she\u00a0was releasing her delegates to the convention and urging them to support Trump. However, her spokeswoman told CNN that Haley was not invited and that the former governor was \u201cfine with that.\u201d \u201cTrump deserves the convention he wants.\u00a0She\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s voting for him and wishes him the best,\u201d spokeswoman Chaney Denton said. Two sources familiar with the discussions told CNN that an invitation may be extended to Haley after all and that such planning was still being worked out. Haley\u00a0made clear in a May speech\u00a0that she would vote for Trump, and the two spoke last month. Trump told Fox News Radio on Wednesday that he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at potentially inviting Haley to speak at the convention. But he noted that \u201cthere was a lot of bad blood there\u201d during their bitter primary fight, which ended with Haley dropping out in March.

The leaders did not provide a specific timeline for Ukraine to join the defensive alliance. Instead, they said they would \u201cbe in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree, and conditions are met.\u201d \u201cWe welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms,\u201d the leaders said in the Washington Summit Declaration, released after a meeting of NATO\u2019s North Atlantic Council Wednesday. \u201cAs Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,\u201d the declaration said. The declaration outlined the alliance\u2019s ongoing support for Kyiv, including previous announcements on new air defense systems and the establishment of the \u201cNATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners.\u201d The description of Ukraine\u2019s path as \u201cirreversible\u201d comes after months of diplomatic negotiations in the lead up to the Washington Summit and was a point of contention among the allies. Prior to the release of the declaration, some diplomats had argued that it was not enough to just describe the path as \u201cirreversible,\u201d but that there must be strong support undergirding that description. Moving the training and equipment coordination under the auspices of NATO has been seen by many as a way to ensure ongoing support for Kyiv in the case of the reelection of former US President Donald Trump. Officials have quietly expressed concerns about what a second Trump presidency could mean for the defensive alliance and for the military support for Kyiv as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine continues with little sign of a military or diplomatic conclusion. There is \u201ca growing and understandable doubt about the future of Western support\u201d for Ukraine, a European diplomat said last week. The aim of the NSATU \u201cis to place security assistance to Ukraine on an enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable, and coherent support,\u201d the declaration said, noting that it \u201cwill not, under international law, make NATO a party to the conflict.\u201d \u201cIt will support the transformation of Ukraine\u2019s defence and security forces, enabling its further integration with NATO,\u201d the declaration said. The leaders also announced \u201ca pledge of long-term support\u201d to Ukraine, with the intention  \u201cto provide a minimum baseline funding of \u20ac40 billion within the next year, and to provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail.\u201d The declaration also expressed \u201cprofound concern\u201d over the \u201cdeepening strategic partnership\u201d between China and Russia \u201cand their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order.\u201d The declaration calls Beijing \u201ca decisive enabler of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine through its so-called \u2018no limits\u2019 partnership and its large-scale support for Russia\u2019s defence industrial base,\u201d and calls on China, \u201cas a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia\u2019s war effort.\u201d It noted that China \u201ccannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\u201d echoing the growing public concern from the US and European allies about Beijing\u2019s support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy", "text": "A federal bankruptcy judge told Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday that he plans to decide by the end of the week whether the former New York mayor should leave bankruptcy protection, which would allow two Georgia election workers to try to seize his properties, or put all of his finances under the control of a trustee. Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings came to a head at a hearing in White Plains, New York, with several outbursts from the mayor, after creditors accused him of not being completely upfront about his finances as they are trying to collect what he owes them. The developments move Giuliani closer to losing his multimillion-dollar apartments in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, as fallout continues from his efforts as a lawyer for Donald Trump after the 2020 election. The election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss are Giuliani\u2019s most significant creditors. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Mr. Giuliani to go back to the real world where he can\u2019t use Chapter 11 as a sword and a shield,\u201d Rachel Strickland, the attorney for Moss and Freeman, said in court. Judge Sean Lane expressed concern about keeping Giuliani tied up in bankruptcy. \u201cI am concerned that the past is prologue\u201d and that \u201cdifficulties in terms of transparency\u201d into Giuliani\u2019s finances during the bankruptcy proceedings might persist, Lane said at the hourlong hearing. The judge said he plans to announce a decision Friday afternoon about what\u2019s next for Giuliani. Giuliani\u2019s attorneys told CNN that if their client leaves bankruptcy protection, he might continue to litigate over control of his two homes and that he still wants to appeal the jury verdict of $148 million awarded to Freeman and Moss for defamation. \u201cEverything will be dealt with in state court,\u201d Giuliani\u2019s lawyer Heath Berger said outside the courthouse after the hearing, referring to Freeman and Moss possibly seeking a lien on his homes. \u201cThe Freeman plaintiffs will take advantage of all of their remedies available, and Mr. Giuliani will take advantage of all remedies that he has available,\u201d Berger added. Hectic day in court The bankruptcy fireworks on Wednesday began with filings, where Giuliani scrambled to change his position after months of fighting off his creditors. Giuliani proposed to a judge he\u00a0leave\u00a0bankruptcy protection\u00a0on Wednesday, essentially agreeing with Freeman and Moss while at the same time being angry with their lawyer\u2019s criticisms of him. If the judge agrees with their plan,\u00a0Freeman and Moss \u201care entitled to take both of his homes immediately,\u201d in Florida and New York, Strickland told CNN. Giuliani\u2019s attorney Gary Fischoff told the judge at the start of the hearing on Wednesday his team believed the purpose of Giuliani for being in bankruptcy has \u201crun its course.\u201d Fischoff added the assets Giuliani has that Freeman and Moss may be able to claim immediately are jewelry,\u00a0namely luxury watches,\u00a0\u200band his two apartments. Giuliani piped up a few times in the hearing after calling in via his iPhone, about 10 minutes late. But the judge told him not to interrupt. \u201cWould you get them on the phone!\u201d Giuliani exclaimed at one point while Strickland was speaking to the judge, apparently trying to communicate with his attorneys. The judge told him he should let Strickland finish, prompting Giuliani to respond, \u201cincluding all the defamatory remarks?\u201d The judge then warned Giuliani he would cut his line if he kept interrupting. If the judge does not agree to dismiss the bankruptcy case, other creditors have been arguing to the judge to remove all of Giuliani\u2019s accounts from his control and place them under the control of a Chapter 11 trustee. That committee does not wish for Giuliani to leave bankruptcy. \u201cThis is slick maneuvering,\u201d Daniel Gielchinsky, a bankruptcy expert who isn\u2019t involved in the case but following it closely, said in response to Giuliani\u2019s 11th-hour move. Giuliani has repeatedly said he plans to appeal the jury verdict Freeman and Moss won against him late last year, but can\u2019t while he is in Chapter 11 proceedings. Bernie Kerik, a close friend of Giuliani\u2019s, told CNN on Wednesday morning that \u201chis spirits are great.\u201d But \u201che\u2019s frustrated with the system,\u201d Kerik added. \u201cHe\u2019s really frustrated by frivolous bullsh*t,\u201d such as his many ongoing civil and criminal court proceedings. The two men had spoken Tuesday night, Kerik said, but hadn\u2019t discussed Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy situation. An attorney for Giuliani also said on Wednesday that Giuliani at one point was open to settling at least one of the ongoing lawsuits he faces, but both sides couldn\u2019t come to terms.

Here is a fact check of some of Biden\u2019s claims in the interview. New York Times polling Biden claimed that \u201cthe New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that he gained a point in New York Times polling after the debate is false. In fact, the Times\u2019 post-debate poll, conducted with Siena College,\u00a0showed Biden doing three points worse\u00a0against former President Donald Trump than he had done in the\u00a0final Times/Siena poll before the debate. Biden\u2019s specific numbers were also wrong. He was not \u201cdown 10 points before the debate\u201d in Times/Siena polling. In fact, he was down three percentage points with likely voters and six percentage points with registered voters. In the Times/Siena poll after the debate, those margins grew to six percentage points with likely voters and nine percentage points with registered voters. Biden did acknowledge his uncertainty about the data when he said \u201cor whatever the hell it is.\u201d But he was wrong, nonetheless. Sen. Mark Warner and the presidency When Stephanopoulos noted a\u00a0Friday report in The Washington Post\u00a0that said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is trying to put together a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Biden to withdraw from the election, Biden responded, \u201cWell, Mark is a good man. We\u2019ve never had that \u2013 he also tried to get the nomination too. Mark\u2019s not \u2013 Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that \u201che also tried to get the nomination too\u201d needs context. Warner has never run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did\u00a0make extensive preparations\u00a0for a possible run for the 2008 nomination, including hiring staff and raising millions for a political action committee, but he\u00a0announced in October 2006\u00a0that he had decided not to launch a campaign after all. And he has not sought the nomination since then. Biden did run in that 2008 presidential primary, which was won by Barack Obama. Trump and bleach Biden repeated his familiar claim that Trump \u201cis a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with Covid.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim is misleading. Trump never portrayed his ill-informed and widely denounced musings about using disinfectants to address Covid-19 as advice to Americans. Rather, Trump was talking about the possibility of scientists conducting tests of this idea. Trump made his remarks, at a\u00a0press briefing in April 2020\u00a0after Bill\u00a0Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said sunlight or disinfectants like\u00a0bleach\u00a0and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces and in saliva. When Trump jumped shortly afterward to the dangerous idea of injecting disinfectants inside people\u2019s bodies, he said: \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were\u00a0slammed by medical experts\u00a0as highly dangerous, and they prompted urgent\u00a0warnings\u00a0from public health authorities and companies that sell household disinfectants. But he never actually said he was suggesting citizens go and use such products. Trump and jobs Biden repeated another one of his regular campaign claims about his Republican opponent, saying Trump was the only president other than Herbert Hoover \u201cwho lost more jobs than he created.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is true, but Biden left out some important context. While there was a\u00a0loss of about\u00a02.7\u00a0million\u00a0jobs\u00a0from the beginning of Trump\u2019s four-year term to the end, there was a gain of about 6.7 million jobs until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country about three years into that term.\u00a0 Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March 2020 and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. The US then started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million from May 2020 through December 2020, but not enough to make up the massive early-pandemic losses.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_republicans-noncitizen-voting-elections-trump", "text": "Voters in eight states soon will decide whether to change their constitutions to explicitly ban voting by noncitizens, part of a multipronged effort by allies of Donald Trump to raise the unlikely specter of foreigners casting ballots in November\u2019s elections to throw the race to his Democratic opponent. North Carolina, a potential presidential battleground, is the most recent state to put a citizen-only voting measure on the fall ballot \u2013 joining Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin, another key swing state in the race for the White House. It\u2019s illegal for people who aren\u2019t US citizens to vote in federal contests, and experts say it rarely happens, given that violators face imprisonment and deportation. But Republican policymakers have pointed to moves by individual cities to give legal noncitizen immigrants the authority to vote on municipal matters to stoke concerns about foreign infiltration of US elections. The growing citizen-only voting movement marries two issues Republicans hope will animate their base this fall: concerns about election fraud and illegal immigration. The Republican-controlled US House voted Wednesday to require proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections.\u00a0In recent weeks, top Republican officials who oversee elections in Tennessee and Ohio have flagged potential noncitizens on their voting rolls, and Louisiana has enacted a law requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. On Monday, Republicans approved a draft party platform that includes a call for proof of citizenship in voting. The platform will be taken up next week at the GOP\u2019s national convention in Milwaukee. Trump himself has made outlandish claims about Democrats seeking to add undocumented immigrants to the voter rolls. \u201cNon citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians who are not being stopped by an equally dishonest Justice Department,\u201d the former president wrote Tuesday on his Truth Social platform, urging passage of the congressional bill, known as the SAVE Act. Critics, however, say the push to require proof of citizenship to vote could erect unnecessary barriers for US citizens, including young people on college campuses who might not have ready access to their birth certificates when they register to vote. And they argue that Republicans aligned with Trump are hoping to establish a predicate to challenge the outcome of November\u2019s election should the GOP not succeed in winning the White House and making gains in Congress. Michael Waldman, the president of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school, called concerns about widespread noncitizen voting \u201can urban myth \u2026 being pushed preemptively, I believe, to set the stage for undermining the legitimacy of the 2024 election.\u201d \u201cThis year, the Big Lie is being pre-deployed,\u201d he said during a recent congressional hearing. Trump allies are among those lobbying for the changes.\u00a0Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser in the Trump White House known for his hard-line immigration positions, recently spoke in support of changing federal law to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Lawmakers who oppose that, Miller said during a news conference on Capitol Hill, \u201cwill be declaring to the whole country that they want Joe Biden\u2019s illegals to vote in this election.\u201d Cleta Mitchell, a conservative lawyer who joined Trump on his now-infamous call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to \u201cfind\u201d the necessary votes to overturn his 2020 defeat in the state, recently launched the Only Citizens Vote Coalition, which advocates proof-of-citizenship laws. Federal and state moves Republicans on Capitol Hill have made the issue a priority. The GOP-controlled House has voted to repeal a Washington, DC, statute permitting legal permanent residents of the city to vote in local elections. The measure the House approved Wednesday, which had Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s backing, would require people to present proof of citizenship \u2013 such as a birth certificate or valid US passport \u2013 in person when registering to vote. Neither bill is expected to pass the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority. But Johnson, at a recent news conference, said potential voting by undocumented immigrants represents a \u201cclear and present danger to the integrity of our election system\u201d and called the proof-of-citizenship bill \u201cone of the most important pieces of legislation that will be presented within our lifetime.\u201d Among its provisions: requiring states to establish a system for removing noncitizens from their voting rolls and giving state officials access to federal agency databases to help determine the citizenship status of voters. The bill would also allow private citizens to file lawsuits against election officials who registered noncitizens to vote. The push to spell out prohibitions on noncitizen voting has gained traction at the state level too.\u00a0Voters in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota and Ohio all have approved citizenship voting requirements in recent years. And since the 2020 election, 11 states have approved new laws targeting noncitizen voting, according to a tally by the Voting Rights Lab. In North Carolina, the Republican-controlled legislature late last month approved the fall ballot measure that would enshrine citizen-only voting in the state constitution. Like other states, the North Carolina legislature has the power to refer measures to the ballot without requiring the governor\u2019s signature. Voting by noncitizens is already against state law in North Carolina. And the state\u2019s constitution says that \u201cevery person born in the United States and every person who has been naturalized\u201d is eligible to vote. Voters will decide whether to change that to say \u201conly a citizen of the United States\u201d can vote. \u201cIt has to say \u2018only,\u2019 so it\u2019s clear that\u2019s what we mean,\u201d said Paul Jacob, chairman of Americans for Citizen Voting, which has advocated ballot initiatives in North Carolina and other states. \u201cWe\u2019re really pushing back against cities around the country that are pushing noncitizen voting and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s let the people decide that,\u2019\u201d he said. Washington, DC, is one of several localities that allow noncitizens to participate in local elections. Others include San Francisco; Takoma Park, Maryland, a liberal suburb just outside the nation\u2019s capital; and three cities in Vermont. A New York City law that would have allowed voting on local issues by some 800,000 legal permanent residents and people with authorization to work in US was struck down by two courts as violating the state constitution, following a legal challenge from the Republican National Committee and others. The City Council has appealed to New York state\u2019s highest court. The RNC recently filed a lawsuit challenging a noncitizen voting ordinance in school board and budget elections in another municipality, Burlington, Vermont \u2013 the state\u2019s largest city. \u201cAmericans should decide American elections,\u201d RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement announcing the Burlington lawsuit. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 persistent efforts to enable noncitizen voting dilute the voices of Americans in Vermont and across the country.\u201d Voting rights experts say instances of people who aren\u2019t US citizens casting ballots are extremely rare. In Georgia, a state with nearly 8 million registered voters, state election officials in 2022 conducted an audit of its voter rolls to gauge attempts by noncitizens to register to vote. It found that 1,634 potential noncitizens\u202fhad attempted to register between 1997 and early 2022. But none was successful, according to Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state. And in North Carolina, a post-election audit of the nearly 4.8 million votes cast in the 2016 general election found evidence that 41 noncitizens with permanent legal status in the US had voted. Still, the issue is a potentially powerful motivator\u00a0for GOP voters. Among Republican-aligned registered voters, immigration ranked behind only the economy as a top issue, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April. And a recent Marquette Law School poll of registered Wisconsin voters found that 52% said Trump would do better on immigration and border security, compared with just 28% who thought Biden would. Noncitizen voting is \u201ca good issue for Republicans to drive,\u201d said Charles Franklin, who oversees the Marquette poll. \u201cTrump is combining multiple elements of immigration to make a powerful rhetorical connection between the border crisis and vote fraud and manipulation of elections,\u201d he said. A Supreme Court hurdle to proof-of-citizenship push Amid the ballot initiatives banning noncitizen voting is a separate but related push to require that prospective voters provide documents showing their citizenship to register to vote. Louisiana is the most recent state to adopt such a law, and the New Hampshire legislature has sent such a measure to Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s desk, but it is unclear whether he will sign it. Republicans hold the executive and legislative levers of power in both states. Long-running Republican efforts to impose such mandates are constrained by a 2013 Supreme Court opinion, authored by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, that limited when a state could implement such a requirement. The ruling allows\u202ffor demands of citizenship documents from voters casting ballots in state elections but says that for federal elections, states are obligated to accept a federal voter registration form that currently does not require proof of citizenship. Only Arizona \u2013 where voters approved a 2004 ballot initiative at the center of the 2013 case \u2013 has set up the type of two-track election system that allows it to require proof of citizenship for state elections. It\u2019s unclear whether Louisiana will seek to implement its newly passed requirement for federal elections. The GOP-backed proof-of-citizenship bill in the US House would override the 2013 ruling by amending the National Voter Registration Act. But congressional Republicans would be unable to enact the legislation absent a GOP trifecta in Washington. In the meantime, litigation is ongoing around a 2022 Arizona law that would impose the proof-of-citizenship requirement for voters in the presidential election and for ballots submitted by mail, with the RNC intervening in the case to defend the requirement. The judge in the case has blocked the proof-of-citizenship requirement, and Republicans are asking an appeals court to reinstate it for this year\u2019s election. The judge upheld other aspects of the law, including much of its requirement that county recorders use various databases to check for indications that a person seeking to register is a noncitizen. Election experts have concerns that some databases are outdated and ill-suited for such an analysis. Opponents of proof-of-citizenship requirements say that, without certain fail-safes or exceptions, such rules could lead to citizens being wrongfully disenfranchised because they lack access to the types of documents that meet the requirement. A newly released survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and other groups found that 9% of voting-age citizens don\u2019t have or would have difficulty accessing documents proving their citizenship and that 2% of voting-age Americans don\u2019t have any form of such documents. The people who could be disenfranchised by such a requirement would likely be very old and very young Americans, citizens on the lower end of the socioeconomic scale, and low-frequency voters, according to Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School professor who has worked on voting issues in Democratic administrations. Noting that some of those voters lean Republican, Levitt said of the GOP officials pushing the measures:\u202f\u201cIn order to counter a stereotype \u2013 and maybe a tiny trinkle of wrongdoing \u2013 they may be hurting a larger group of eligible voters, and maybe even their own voters.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\u201d But, Clooney added, the Biden he saw during the June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \u201cwas not the Joe \u201cbig F-ing deal\u201d Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020.\u201d \u201cHe was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d Clooney added, referencing Biden\u2019s faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN. That statement was a stunning assessment of Biden\u2019s current state from someone who has interacted with the president privately \u2014 that the way the president presented himself during that debate, which the White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed on a cold and a tiring travel schedule, was not an aberration. Clooney is not just a movie star and a prominent donor: He\u2019s someone who has spent time with Biden over the years and has always been a big fan. This goes all the way back to Biden\u2019s early days as vice president, when Clooney came by the White House and dropped in to Biden\u2019s then-office down the hall in the West Wing from the Oval Office and ended up having an extended visit talking about helping Darfur. Clooney is friendly with Obama too, but he and Biden have stayed in touch over the years, and the strength of that relationship held even when Biden criticized the International Criminal Court\u2019s May decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a result of his actions in Gaza \u2013 which Clooney\u2019s wife, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, had been a key part of crafting. Clooney called a top White House adviser to complain, but he did not pull back on his support then, or on his participation in the June fundraiser. Biden forcefully criticized the ICC\u2019s efforts because of the implication of an equivalence between Israel and Hamas. Clooney is also seen by many Democratic backers in Hollywood as a sort of compass given his engagement and activism. His standing with Biden until now helped rally wider donor and celebrity support, even among some who had never been big Biden fans and were not enthused about backing him long before the debate. Asked for comment Wednesday, Biden\u2019s campaign pointed toward the letter the president wrote to members of Congress on Monday indicating he would remain in the race. Clooney\u2019s opinion piece represents the biggest defection against Biden in Hollywood, which the party has long relied on for big-named support and money. It comes as a handful of Democrats in Congress have also publicly demanded Biden step aside due to persistent concerns about his age and mental acuity. The fundraiser that Clooney headlined raised $28 million for Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, the most for the Democratic Party from a single event in history. A source familiar with the event says that part of the reason that the Los Angeles fundraiser took place on June 15\u00a0\u2013 immediately after Biden\u2019s travel to the G7 summit in Italy \u2013 was because that was the one date Clooney said would work for him. Biden has cited his intense travel ahead of last month\u2019s debate as one reason for his poor performance. In the opinion piece, Clooney called on key Democrats \u2014 naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 to ask Biden to \u201cvoluntarily step aside.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to win in November with this president,\u201d Clooney warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view. He said the country deserves to hear from other politicians who are seen as potential replacements for Biden on the ticket, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Saying \u201cthe dam has broken,\u201d Clooney wrote \u201cwe can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\u201d Clooney\u2019s opinion piece comes amid the most crucial week of Biden\u2019s reelection campaign, as cracks in the coalition of Democratic support behind Biden continued to grow. At least eight members of Congress from his own party have publicly asked Biden to step down from the ticket. On Wednesday, CNN reported organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. Organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed\u00a0given the continued erosion of support\u00a0for Biden\u2019s candidacy. The event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, is just one of many events planned in conjunction with the party\u2019s convention, when the campaign was expecting to tap into high-dollar supporters\u2019 enthusiasm and wallets for the home stretch of the race. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule. Clooney isn\u2019t the only prominent Hollywood Democrat who has asked Biden to step down. Rob\u00a0Reiner, a Biden surrogate who attended a fundraiser alongside Harris after the debate, also called for the president to step aside. \u201cMy friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\u201d\u00a0Reiner said in a\u00a0post\u00a0to social media platform X Wednesday in which he linked to Clooney\u2019s op-ed. Reiner\u00a0began his calls on Biden to step down earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop (expletive) around. If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It\u2019s time for Joe Biden to step down,\u201d he\u00a0wrote\u00a0Sunday. Biden is participating in high-stakes meetings with NATO allies on Wednesday and will hold a solo news conference \u2014 his first since the debate \u2014 on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_joe-biden-debate-discussions", "text": "Nearly two weeks after President Joe Biden\u2019s stunningly halting debate performance, many of his fellow Democrats are still fretting\u00a0about it\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0anxiously wondering whether\u00a0Biden is really the\u00a0party\u2019s best bet to defeat Donald Trump in November. But the president and his team are done talking about\u00a0it. Aides to the president told CNN that not only are they no longer interested in discussing Biden\u2019s on-stage fiasco last\u00a0month,\u00a0and there are simply no outstanding questions about the president\u2019s political future to debate. Biden is staying in the race, they say, and there is nothing that could change that. It doesn\u2019t matter how many more Democratic lawmakers might call\u00a0on Biden to drop out; it doesn\u2019t matter what news outlet releases a new editorial calling on the president to abandon his campaign for a second term; it doesn\u2019t matter how Biden\u2019s upcoming public appearances and interviews go. \u201cWe\u2019re done talking about the debate and focused on a singular mission: Defeating Donald Trump in November,\u201d one Biden aide told CNN. And\u00a0rather than worry about the president\u2019s political future, a senior administration official told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m moving on to my day job.\u201d They may not find it so easy to move on. Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0White House\u00a0press briefing was\u00a0once again dominated by questions about Biden\u2019s health, mental fitness and the political fallout of the debate. Diplomats in Washington for the NATO summit this week are nervous about whether Biden will be able to defeat Trump a second time. And the president himself is set to face the press in a rare solo news conference on Thursday at the summit, where he\u2019s sure to face intense questions about the future of his political life and his health. Despite all that, asked\u00a0about the likelihood the president had considered withdrawing since the debate, a longtime adviser to Biden said:\u00a0\u201cZero. He truly believes he is the only person who can defeat Donald Trump. It\u2019s not an act.\u201d Aides also\u00a0say that the president\u2019s family, some of whom had privately discussed whether Biden should fire any senior staff in the immediate aftermath of the CNN debate, remain all in on the 81-year-old president\u2019s pursuit of a second term. The adviser told CNN that some members within the president\u2019s inner circle have expressed concern about the deterioration of support for Biden on Capitol Hill \u2013 but that only the president\u2019s own family could persuade him to exit the race, and only if they had hard data. \u201cJill and Valerie won\u2019t let him go down in flames,\u201d this adviser told CNN, referencing the president\u2019s wife and sister by their first names. The president, for his part, has sought to personally reassure nervous supporters in recent days, including by calling into meetings this week with donors and elected officials. In a letter written to Democratic lawmakers on Monday, Biden forcefully called on his party to turn the page on the debate, saying: \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cWe have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election,\u201d he added. \u201cAny weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us.\u201d But those moves have done little to calm the nerves of some despondent Democratic elected officials. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate emerged from their respective caucus meetings and told reporters that there had been plenty of airing of concerns about the president\u2019s viability. Those conversations would continue into the week, some of them said. The president\u2019s letter to his colleagues angered some lawmakers, who found it wholly dismissive of real concerns that exist across the party. \u201cHe told us to go F ourselves,\u201d one House Democrat said. Democrats, including those\u00a0inside the administration, view\u00a0this week as critical to Biden\u2019s political survival,\u00a0in no small part because lawmakers\u00a0on Capitol Hill gathered privately for their weekly meetings\u00a0on Tuesday.\u00a0Neither\u00a0House nor Senate Democrats emerged from their meetings with a consensus on how to move forward, though it was clear that concerns had been aired behind closed doors. On the House side, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries listened as he was confronted with concerns and frustrations from all factions of the caucus during House Democrats\u2019 Tuesday meeting. The open mic format, during which roughly 30 lawmakers spoke, was designed so Jeffries and his leadership team could hear directly from members during the group\u2019s first in-person meeting since the presidential debate. While Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a staunch Biden ally, called the meeting \u201cvery positive,\u201d another Democratic member in the meeting told CNN that there was a sense of \u201csadness\u201d in the room from \u201ctalking about someone you love who is in obvious decline.\u201d In the Senate meeting, Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana all said they thought Biden cannot win the election, a source familiar told CNN. The approach from\u00a0Senate\u00a0Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was that it was kind of a fait accompli and there wasn\u2019t much he could do, and if the senators thought he should get out, they should call the president, the source said. Reporters are also continuing to press the White House for answers as press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre faces a daily\u00a0onslaught of questions about the president\u2019s health and medical records. Jean-Pierre\u00a0on Tuesday defended her statements to the press about her answers about Biden\u2019s health, acknowledging that the past few weeks have been an \u201cunprecedented time\u201d and that she was working to \u201cmeet the moment.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal, Annie Grayer, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Michael Williams contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/joe-biden-debate-discussions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is rejecting any idea that he would step aside as the Democratic nominee, a decision that is his alone. When we asked readers what questions they have about Biden, they expressed some confusion about the process that made him the presumptive Democratic nominee. Here are answers to some of the questions posed to CNN from readers: No. There was a series of primaries in states and territories this year and voters in those contests overwhelmingly backed Biden. He faced only token opposition from a little-known congressman, Rep. Dean Phillips, and an author, Marianne Williamson. Biden won nearly all of the 3,949 pledged delegates who will officially select the party\u2019s nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Delegates pick the nominee during a roll-call vote. While party rules don\u2019t formally require delegates to vote for the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged, they\u2019re supposed to, and campaigns have the right to approve the delegates pledged to their candidates. Biden has the votes to win the nomination in that first round of voting and realistically, it\u2019s highly unlikely that another candidate could be elected without Biden voluntarily stepping aside. This is an unprecedented situation. Primaries began in January and went on for months. That monthslong process provided Democrats and independents who wanted to take part in the Democratic primary the opportunity to back a different candidate. Each one of those primaries, arguably, was a sort of off-ramp. But Democrats at the time were largely rallying behind Biden. That was, however, before his poor debate performance fed festering concerns about his age. It is remarkable that even though polling has long suggested voters feel Biden is too old and would have preferred a different choice, high quality opponents did not challenge him. Phillips and Williamson never gained traction and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. left the Democratic Party to run as an independent rather than challenge Biden for the party nomination. The party also worked hard to discourage opposition to Biden. It did not sponsor debates, and multiple states, including Delaware and Florida, did not hold Democratic primaries after it was clear that Biden had the delegates to win the nomination. Delegates are supposed to honor the voters in their states. Here\u2019s the language in the Democratic party rules for the 2024 convention: \u201cAll delegates to the National Convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d Primaries are an important part of the process and primary voters chose Biden. Not that they had much choice; the party worked hard to unify early behind Biden and discouraged serious opposition. But delegates technically pick the party nominee, which is why it would probably take Biden releasing the delegates he won to replace him on the ticket. We received several versions of this question, not all of them fit to print. The large universe of people who believe Trump is unfit to be president have thought that for a long time. There is a universe of people who are newly questioning Biden\u2019s fitness after the debate. I would point out that figure \u2013 that Trump lied more than 30 times at the debate \u2013 is directly reported in CNN\u2019s Fact Check of the debate. From that report: Trump\u2019s repeat falsehoods included his assertions that some Democratic-led states\u00a0allow babies to be executed after birth, that\u00a0every legal scholar and everybody in general wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, that there were\u00a0no terror attacks during his presidency, that\u00a0Iran didn\u2019t fund terror groups during his presidency,\u00a0that\u00a0the US has provided more aid to Ukraine than Europe has, that\u00a0Biden for years referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators,\u201d that Biden is\u00a0planning to quadruple people\u2019s taxes, that\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 National Guard troops for the US Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u00a0that Americans don\u2019t pay the cost of his tariffs on China and other countries, that\u00a0Europe accepts no American cars, that\u00a0he is the president who got the Veterans Choice program through Congress, and\u00a0that fraud marred the results of the 2020 election. So I believe it is inaccurate to say the media is giving Trump a pass. Trump, for his part, has all but disappeared from the campaign trail since the debate and Biden is holding events, doing TV and audio interviews and more as he engages in damage control. There has also been ample coverage of Trump\u2019s criminal trial, his many other legal troubles, and his often outrageous claims and policy proposals. Biden argues he has the best chance of winning and says the pollsters he talks to say the race is a tossup. High-quality public polling since the debate, on the other hand, suggests Trump does have a lead. In hypothetical matchups in which other Democrats are put up against Trump, the results are not currently much different. If those numbers start to change dramatically, pressure on Biden to drop out will increase dramatically. When I put this question to CNN\u2019s polling director, Jennifer Agiesta, she cautioned that polling is frequently misinterpreted as a tool to predict the future. It does not tell us who has a better chance of winning, but the state of the race in a particular moment. \u201cEven before the debate there was almost no polling showing Biden with a significant lead of Trump nationally or in key states,\u201d Agiesta said. \u201cIn a two-way matchup between Trump and Biden, there hasn\u2019t been a high-quality poll showing a significant Biden lead since February.\u201d Biden says he does not have a debilitating cognitive condition so it does not appear he is hiding one. His advisers argue that he maintains a full campaign and governing schedule and he frequently appears in public, although his advisers have clearly tried to minimize unscripted moments. Impeachment is utilized to punish \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d according to the US Constitution. Republican efforts to impeach Biden, which have so far failed, have focused not on his age, but on his son\u2019s former business interests. The 25th Amendment provides a pathway to dislodge an incapacitated president, but it is a complicated process and would require a majority of Biden\u2019s Cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris to agree in writing that he is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d None of his allies are currently saying that about him. But if, in the future, a majority of his Cabinet and Harris (or some other body appointed by Congress) turned on Biden and tried to declare him incapacitated, he could dispute their finding and resume his duties. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days in which to double down on their declaration that the president was unfit, at which point both houses of Congress would have 21 days to decide in a vote if he should carry on as president. It would require two-thirds of the Senate (usually 67 of 100 senators) and two-thirds of the House (usually 290 of 435 representatives) to remove the president from office. Democrats have not exactly turned on Biden. Only a handful of elected Democrats have publicly argued he should step down as the party\u2019s candidate in 2024. But they are almost universally worried that Trump will beat Biden in a rematch. Not only do Democrats disagree with the former president\u2019s policies, they also view him as a destabilizing threat to American democracy. If Biden is not viewed as capable by the few independent voters who might support either candidate, it makes a Trump election more likely. This would get very complicated, as CNN\u2019s David Wright has written: It\u2019s a significant war chest that\u00a0totaled $240 million at the end of June, including the Democratic National Convention and allied committees, according to an announcement from Biden\u2019s campaign on Tuesday. At the end of May, Biden\u2019s campaign account alone held $91.6 million, according to the most recent available data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). If Harris\u00a0were\u00a0tapped as a replacement nominee, she would take over the existing campaign account, and have control of funds deposited there, per FEC rules. If the race were thrown open,\u00a0the Biden-Harris campaign could\u00a0transfer all of\u00a0its\u00a0cash on hand\u00a0to the Democratic National Committee, as\u00a0FEC rules\u00a0permit unlimited transfers from candidate committees to national party committees. The DNC could use those funds in several ways to support a new nominee, and could distribute that money to a variety of other down ballot candidates and allied committees \u2013 but in doing so, the DNC would be limited by FEC rules governing spending and contributions\u00a0for national party committees. There are other options, each with its own set of drawbacks, according to Wright, including turning Biden\u2019s campaign account into a PAC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democratic-fears-biden-landslide-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden and his advisers keep issuing unequivocal declarations that he\u2019s staying in the 2024 race, but Democrats aren\u2019t hearing it. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d repeating her position of a week ago as if Biden had not made any declaration at all. \u201cSpeaker\u00a0Pelosi\u00a0fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do,\u201d a spokesperson said in a subsequent statement. But the comments from such a senior member of the party had already essentially reopened the debate about whether Biden should go. Vermont Sen. Peter Welch on Wednesday evening became the first Democratic senator \u2014 and the 10th congressional Democrat \u2014 to call for Biden to step aside as the nominee, writing in a Washington Post op-ed, \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d That all came on the heels of Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet on Tuesday evening voicing the concerns other Democrats have shared privately. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith from Washington, agreed with that landslide assessment and implored Biden to reconsider. \u201cDon\u2019t let this be your legacy, that you refused to step down and got him back in the White House,\u201d Smith said, referring to Trump, during an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cthe Situation Room.\u201d And New York Rep. Ritchie Torres \u2014 a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been strongly supportive of Biden \u2014 put the potential down-ballot effects of a Biden candidacy bluntly. \u201cIf we are going on a political\u00a0suicide\u00a0mission, then we should at least be honest about it,\u201d he told CNN. Clooney: step aside to \u2018save\u2019 democracy George Clooney, the actor and Democratic fundraiser, is a Biden ally who spent time with him in Los Angeles and cohosted a record-breaking fundraiser for the president\u2019s campaign recently. The Biden that disastrously appeared on the debate stage is the same one that he saw in California, Clooney wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday. Now he argues that Biden needs to step aside so that capable Democrats can come forward to compete for the nomination or face losing control of the entire government. Democrats have been so \u201cterrified\u201d of a second Trump term that they ignored warning signs about Biden during the primary, Clooney said. \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\u201d Clooney wrote, appealing to Biden\u2019s sense of duty. He\u2019s not the only bold-faced Hollywood name raising the alarm. Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas, both Democratic fundraisers, are also on the record. And there are other fundraising concerns: Organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. A test every day Biden told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos during a high-stakes interview last week that he doesn\u2019t need to take a cognitive test and prove his fitness to lead because every day in the presidency is a cognitive test. That\u2019s going to be Biden\u2019s curse going forward. No matter how many fiery teleprompter speeches he gives, he likely won\u2019t be able to suddenly walk without shuffling or talk in conversation with the steadiness he once did. The next of his daily tests will come Thursday, when the president conducts a rare solo news conference at the conclusion of a NATO meeting taking place in Washington. Biden should be talking about his successful efforts to expand the treaty organization and mobilize it to stand up to Russia, but instead he will face question after question about his fitness to do the job. Stephanopoulos, by the way, who spent time in direct contact with the president, told a passerby secretly recording him on a New York City street that he doesn\u2019t think Biden can serve another four years. Next week, Biden will sit down with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt for an interview that will tape and air\u00a0Monday, the network announced Fear of a \u2018landslide\u2019 Bennet, the Colorado Democrat, became the first senator in his party to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester \u2014 the two most vulnerable senators facing reelection \u2014 also said Biden would not win during a meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar, CNN reported Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country,\u201d Bennet said on CNN. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s critically important, for us, to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\u201d Democrats are already in a difficult position in the race to control the Senate, since they are defending a larger number of seats than Republicans this cycle. About a third of the Senate is up for election every two years. CNN\u2019s senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein argued Tuesday that a Biden loss could cost Democrats the Senate, which would reverberate for decades since it would give aging conservative justices on the Supreme Court, like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, cover to resign and solidify the court\u2019s conservative majority. Trump is currently ahead CNN\u2019s Road to 270 assessment of the electoral map shows Trump in position to win the election. Georgia, Michigan and Nevada \u2014 all states that Biden won in 2020 \u2014 are all leaning toward Republicans. If Trump wins those three state and all the states he won in 2020, he would have 272 electoral votes, enough to win the election. CNN Senior data reporter Harry Enten said polling clearly shows Trump is ahead at this point. But he notes that polling this far from the election does not generally represent the final vote. \u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at this data we should keep in mind that it\u2019s still just July and the election is in November,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how things shift as things go on from here.\u201d Is Biden hearing this? The Democratic leader in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, has publicly backed Biden, but he has told nervous lawmakers he will take their concerns to the White House, according to CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer and Manu Raju. But Jeffries\u00a0brushed off questions about whether Biden is the most effective nominee and said he has no plans to meet with him on Wednesday. \u201cOver the last few days, the members of the House Democratic Caucus have had conversations that are candid, constructive and clear-eyed about the path forward, which primarily includes doing everything we can to make sure that we take back the majority in November of this year,\u201d he told reporters on his way into a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. Some Democrats want to move on from this debate, worrying that it only boosts Trump. \u201cDonald Trump and the Republicans have loved every minute of watching this discussion,\u201d Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents the battleground state of Michigan, told CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean.

But now, as Biden fights to keep a grip on the party after his calamitous debate performance, many of those same detractors are emerging as critical allies. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, both regulars on the campaign trail for Biden and Democrats, have offered the president lifelines this week, publicly backing him during one of the tensest moments of his political life. \u201cHe has made it abundantly clear that he\u2019s in this race, he is not leaving, and I am here to support him and I\u2019m here to make sure that we win in November,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told reporters on Monday. Biden, a source familiar with their conversation told CNN,\u00a0called Ocasio-Cortez this weekend. Sanders has acknowledged the president\u2019s debate performance was \u201cbad,\u201d but also criticized the media for trying to make the election into a \u201cbeauty contest,\u201d when Americans are \u2013 or should be \u2013 \u201cvoting for policy.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks have also caught the attention of other progressive House members and their staffs. In one recent text message\u00a0reviewed by CNN,\u00a0an aide to a progressive House member told a colleague, \u201cHonestly, if the squad were to say anything, I want them to say\u201d what Ocasio-Cortez did on Monday. \u201cSo the centrists own this mess.\u201d Another staffer\u00a0for a different progressive member, in a separate message, made a similar argument. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna say anything let\u2019s say what AOC is saying,\u201d the staffer said in a text reviewed by CNN. \u201cSo that whatever chaos is ensuing in the party is the centrists battling it out.\u201d The strategy headlined by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders is not unanimously popular\u00a0across\u00a0the progressive universe, some of which remains skeptical of\u00a0aligning\u00a0too closely with the president. But it reflects both the increasingly cagey approach to Washington politics adapted by some on the left during Biden\u2019s presidency and an understanding, according to multiple sources familiar with internal conversations, that calling now for Biden to quit the race would have little effect on his decision while offering fodder for outside groups \u2013 as they did in working to oust Rep. Jamaal Bowman \u2013 to accuse progressives of being disloyal to the president and the party. \u201cEven if we have been strong critics of Biden, especially over the Gaza stuff before the debate, it is not to our advantage, both in terms of being effectual in removing him or having him withdraw, to be the loudest ones calling for him to withdraw,\u201d said one Democratic strategist in close contact with several progressive offices. \u201cThat would only backfire on them and actually maybe help him stay in power.\u201d Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar told CNN on Tuesday that conversation around Biden\u2019s fate is all but over. He will be the nominee, she said, and anyone who thinks otherwise is living \u201cin an alternate universe.\u201d \u201cIn this moment, progressives are thinking about what it means for us to continue to build on the progress that we have made,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAnd we know that a Trump presidency poses a great threat to that progress. And the reelection of Biden allows for us the opportunity to continue to push for progress.\u201d The Biden campaign declined to comment. Another progressive strategist offered a blunt assessment of the dynamics between the Biden campaign and lefty lawmakers. \u201cProgressives are always damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t, and I think we all know they\u2019re not going to be what keeps Biden in or out of this race \u2013 that\u2019s up to Biden and the people around him,\u201d the strategist said. House progressives expect to meet directly with Biden in the coming days as the White House schedules sitdowns with assorted party factions. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had his own meeting with progressive caucus leaders on Tuesday, a source familiar with gathering told CNN. \u201cI am fully behind him as our nominee, until he is not our nominee,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cThere are serious concerns that have been raised.\u201d Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, who is facing a tough primary challenge in her St. Louis district, said that for all the \u201cconcerns\u201d aired at the Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday, the fundamental goal \u2013 defeating Trump \u2013 was unifying. \u201cIt\u2019s just making sure that there is a path,\u201d she said. Bush has not committed to a position, indicating that some members of the progressive bloc in Congress are still deliberating about their next steps. \u201cThe whole squad has not endorsed the president. Some have. Some have not said anything publicly. We haven\u2019t said anything publicly,\u201d Bush said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m listening to my constituents and I\u2019m hearing from my colleagues.\u201d Though there is a social media chorus criticizing Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives for not trying to undermine Biden, the message from leaders like Sanders has been clear: It\u2019s time to end the drama and back Biden. \u201cI think (Biden) had a terrible debate. Nobody disagrees\u00a0with that,\u00a0I think he\u2019s been doing better\u00a0since that debate. I think he\u2019s got to get out there. He\u2019s got to talk to people,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins on Monday night. \u201cI think that he has the ability to be an excellent\u00a0president. But what we need right now in that campaign is an agenda that speaks to the next four years. People\u00a0are hurting.\u201d Longtime Sanders campaign adviser Nina Turner, a former state senator in Ohio and DNC member who has never been shy in criticizing the president or Democrats, recently wrote in a Newsweek op-ed that she believed Biden should leave the race. But rather than push for a leftist replacement, she backed Vice President Kamala Harris to take over. Her logic in coming to that decision, she explained, largely followed what more typically cautious Capitol Hill progressives have been saying. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting too caught up in a mess that we didn\u2019t make,\u201d Turner said of the infighting over Biden\u2019s fate. \u201cThe more moderate neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party will never let progressives have a progressive candidate, so why are we sweating this?\u201d The suggestion that progressives could vault one of their own to the nomination during an open convention, Turner added, was little more than fan fiction. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a horse in this race,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we need to settle down and we need to focus on pushing and keep doing what we\u2019re doing, which is to try to push this party further to the left. Whoever it is, we are going to push them and make demands.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/aoc-sanders-biden-progressives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial", "text": "Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s defense attorney wrapped up his closing arguments Wednesday, saying the case against the New Jersey Democrat was \u201cshaky and rotten to its core.\u201d \u201cThis case dies here today because they have failed to prove,\u00a0they have failed to prove\u00a0to that very high standard that Bob\u2019s actions were anything other than exactly what we want our elected officials to do. He was doing his job, and he was doing it well,\u201d the senator\u2019s attorney\u00a0Adam Fee\u00a0said in Manhattan criminal court. \u201cResist the temptation to pick a salacious story about a corrupt politician because it\u2019s\u00a0not,\u00a0it\u2019s not there, \u201d Fee said. \u201cYou must acquit because there is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Bob took anything in exchange for a particular official action.\u201d Menendez and his co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of participating in a yearslong bribery scheme. Federal prosecutors say the senator tried to use his power to advance Egyptian military interests, interfere in criminal prosecutions, and secure investment from Qatari officials, among other things. Menendez and his wife allegedly received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a Mercedes Benz convertible and other bribes in exchange for his influence. The senator\u2019s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but will be tried separately later this year after she was granted a delay by the judge so she can focus on her treatment for breast cancer. She has pleaded not guilty. Bob Menendez\u2019s team called a total of five\u00a0witnesses to testify in his defense during the trial, though not the senator himself. In all,\u00a037 witnesses were called over the nine-week trial. Fee began his fiery closing arguments Tuesday afternoon and concluded Wednesday morning after spending roughly five hours addressing jurors. Fee said Tuesday that\u00a0federal prosecutors had presented a \u201ccherry-picked\u201d\u00a0case\u00a0that asks the jury to convict the senator based solely on\u00a0non-credible\u00a0\u201cinferences\u201d\u00a0and not on\u00a0evidence. \u201cAssumption, speculation, fantasy, conjecture. They will call it inference, it\u2019s\u00a0not,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cYou are being asked to imagine, in the gaps of evidence, the criminal stuff.\u201d In reference to the cash and gold found in the Menendez home, Fee reiterated that Bob Menendez\u00a0customarily stored cash due to familial trauma from fleeing Cuba and that Nadine Menendez already owned gold, gifted to her by her family. \u201cThey want you to conclude that every dollar, every piece of gold, every item of value that you have heard a reference to in this case, must\u2019ve been a bribe,\u201d he said. Fee\u00a0said\u00a0the senator didn\u2019t even know\u00a0about the gold\u00a0that\u00a0the FBI seized from the Menendez home during the\u00a0raid on June 16, 2022. He said that the cash found inside the senator\u2019s home office was\u00a0money he had withdrawn and that the cash found in the basement, stuffed inside shoes and jacket pockets, could not reasonably be pointed back to his client. The FBI seized a total of $486,461 of cash, 11 one-ounce gold bars, and two\u00a0one-kilogram\u00a0gold bars from the home, according to\u00a0trial testimony. \u2018Corruption on a massive scale\u2019 Federal prosecutors on Tuesday concluded their closing arguments, which also lasted approximately five hours over two days. \u201cThis is a big case, but it all boils down to a classic case of corruption on a massive scale,\u201d Assistant US Attorney Paul Monteleoni told the jury. \u201cIt\u2019s about a politician who put his power up for sale and the people who were willing to buy it from him.\u201d In his closing arguments, Monteleoni\u00a0challenged\u00a0the defense\u2019s suggestion that Nadine Menendez kept her husband in the dark about key parts of the alleged quid pro quo scheme. \u201cThe pattern was the same: Menendez was in charge,\u201d the prosecutor said Monday. \u201cHis wife, Nadine, was his go-between, demanding payment, receiving payment, passing messages but always, always keeping him informed.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by being clueless,\u201d Monteleoni said of the senator. On Tuesday, Monteleoni\u00a0focused\u00a0on the part of the alleged scheme involving Jose Uribe,\u00a0the New Jersey businessman who allegedly bribed the senator in exchange for legal favors and pleaded guilty before the trial began.\u00a0Uribe testified in June that he gave Nadine Menendez a\u00a0Mercedes-Benz convertible\u00a0in exchange for the senator\u2019s promise to intervene in criminal investigations into his associates. Monteleoni said messages between the senator and his wife show that he was \u201cin the weeds on the whole car purchase.\u201d Uribe\u00a0previously testified\u00a0that during a 2020 dinner, the senator told him in Spanish, \u201cI saved your a** twice. Not once, but twice.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat is the boast of a corrupt politician about wielding power for the private benefit of the person paying him bribes,\u201d Monteleoni said Tuesday. Menendez\u2019s attorneys consistently tried to undermine Uribe\u2019s credibility during the trial. On Wednesday, Fee argued that Uribe was \u201cgood liar\u201d who \u201cembellished\u201d his testimony to \u201cinvent corroboration\u201d with other evidence of text messages, phone calls and restaurant meetings that\u00a0were\u00a0presented at trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_biden-fate-political-career", "text": "The high-stakes week ahead is critical to whether President Joe Biden\u2019s defiance will save his reelection bid or whether Democrats who question his capacity to serve a second term will succeed in pressuring him to step aside. While only a handful of House Democrats have\u00a0publicly called for the president to end his campaign, there is deep disquiet inside the party at the possibility that Biden, who swept\u00a0Donald Trump out of the White House four years ago, could ruin his legacy\u00a0and throw the country into uncharted political territory by\u00a0failing to deter voters from sending\u00a0his rival back in the Oval Office after November\u2019s election. Biden on Monday emphatically said he was staying in the race. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter to congressional Democrats. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Democratic anxiety reverberated through a call that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hosted for his conference Sunday afternoon. Some members said Biden should go, and there\u2019s a consensus among dozens of party lawmakers that he needs to step aside, sources told CNN. But a meeting that Sen. Mark Warner planned for Monday to consider the president\u2019s future is now scrapped, and the Virginia Democrat has not decided whether he thinks Biden should step aside, a source said. Several key party heavyweights said on Sunday morning news shows that the president needs to do far more to ease skepticism among voters. \u201cI think this week is going to be really critical for him to answer those remaining questions,\u201d Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The president nevertheless insisted in a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania on Sunday that \u201cI\u2019m up for the job!\u201d Biden reinforced his refusal to cede the Democratic nomination he earned through a largely unopposed primary run in a high-stakes interview with ABC News on Friday, warning only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could compel him to end his campaign. But the interview only reinforced Democrats\u2019 panic that followed his devastating debate performance last month over his chances of beating Republican presumptive nominee Trump. The interview also raised further questions over Biden\u2019s health as he seeks a new term that would end when he is 86 and over whether he understands the gravity of his political plight as he trails Trump in polls. The turmoil surrounding Biden\u2019s future is creating a grim mood inside the White House, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee reported. West Wing staffers are rattled by the president\u2019s debate performance and the coverage of the president\u2019s subsequent struggles, although support for his reelection bid remains strong in the building. A moment of soul-searching for the Democratic Party Among the key questions now is whether a critical mass of lawmakers will unite to try to convince the president to stand aside. \u2022 If that happens, would senior party leaders be willing to go to the\u00a0president\u00a0and argue that his position is unsustainable?\u2022 And even if they did, would Biden \u2013 who has earned the votes of millions of Democrats to secure the nomination and who maintains he is fully fit to serve a new term\u00a0\u2013\u00a0agree to cede his campaign?\u2022 If the president remained obdurate at this point, Democrats would face a decision on whether to go public about their views, and many in critical states and districts would have to consider distancing themselves from their own party\u2019s presidential nominee to try to save themselves in November. There is an almost surreal quality to the frenzied political debate as Biden digs in. It would be an extraordinary twist to an already remarkable year in which Republicans will nominate a convicted felon and\u00a0twice-impeached former president if Democrats decline at the last minute to nominate a sitting president, who most believe has had a successful term,\u00a0over concerns that he can\u2019t win. Passing on Biden would also\u00a0mark\u00a0a humiliating coda to a political career that has spanned half a century, and the president would likely regard himself as the victim of scathing betrayal. If Democrats do push him aside, they\u2019d create a high-risk scenario unprecedented in modern history. They\u2019d have to decide whether to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 which has already begun in some quarters \u2013 or whether to stage a lightning process to pick an unvetted neophyte new nominee. There would be no guarantee that a new standard-bearer would do better than Biden, who has already beaten Trump once. But the fact many want to try shows the intensity of alarm in the party and the potency of the image of an aged and sometimes incoherent president blazed on the minds of 50 million television viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta. In a worrying sign for Biden, even senior party figures who are normally supportive and laud the achievements of his term argue that he must do far more to convince voters that he is up to the demands of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the president\u2019s performance at the debate has raised questions for voters, not questions about his character or his decency or who he cares about or who he fights for, but questions as to whether this is still the old Joe Biden,\u201d Murphy said on\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0\u201cState of the Union.\u201d He told Dana Bash that the president needed to get out and \u201cdo a town hall, that he do a press conference,\u00a0(to) show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden.\u201d Rep. Adam\u00a0Schiff also raised concerns. Like Murphy, Schiff poured praise on Biden\u2019s achievements and lacerated Trump. But he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the debate performance raised concerns among voters about whether Biden had the capacity to win \u201can existential race.\u201d Given that Trump is a convicted criminal, the California Democrat said that the election shouldn\u2019t be close and that the president\u2019s age is the only reason it is. \u201cHe should seek out people with some distance and objectivity. He should seek pollsters who are not his own pollsters. He should take a moment to make the best-informed judgment. And if the judgment is run, then run hard and beat that SOB.\u201d The comments of the two senior Democrats underscore the disconnect in the party. While there is alarm among many on Capitol Hill and a desire for the president to do far more in unscripted situations to prove his fitness, Biden himself has already ruled out ending his reelection bid. He refused to answer a question in the ABC News interview about what he would do if leaders such as Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told him that he could harm Democrats in Congress if he stayed in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Biden said. But the president is getting strong support from his allies in the Congressional Black Caucus.\u00a0Ohio\u00a0Rep. Joyce\u00a0Beatty, a former chair of the CBC, said Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be going rogue against our own president.\u201d And voters at the Essence Festival in New Orleans voiced confidence in Biden and resisted calls for him to end his campaign, CNN\u2019s Ebony Davis and Eva McKend reported. The\u00a0ABC News interview aside, the president is not throwing himself into the intense scrutiny of repeated and spontaneous political events that even many of his supporters want to see. On Sunday, the president gave a speech in a Black church in Philadelphia and addressed campaign workers in a short, off-the-cuff speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He did spend considerable time working a rope line in stifling heat. And later this week, he\u2019s expected to hold a news conference at the NATO summit he\u2019s hosting in Washington, which will be another critical barometer of his faculties. But many Democrats want him to do more amid fears that his position is so precarious that he will not only lose the White House but that he could also drag down his party, allowing Republicans to win back the House and retain the Senate. With the Supreme Court cementing an era of ultra-conservative jurisprudence, many Democrats are openly scared of the consequences of a second, unrestrained Trump presidency. House Democrats on Sunday vented their frustration about Biden\u2019s troubles and the impact they could have on winning back the House, a possibility that many members had been optimistic about until the debate. \u201cIt was pretty brutal,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation among House leaders. No decisions about demands for a White House meeting or about the possibility of sending a letter to Biden are expected to be made before the full Democratic caucus meets Tuesday, aides said. A source who was on the Sunday call told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee that Jeffries has not taken a position on what should happen. But the Tuesday meeting looms as a fateful moment for the president. Concern about Biden\u2019s ability to perform on the campaign trail and the long-term implications of the debate remain deep, despite the legacy of a first term in which his legislative record matches or surpasses that of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson. Rep. Gerry Connolly, for instance, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Saturday that he believed what happened was more than \u201ca bad night, and that\u2019s why that image is so indelible on so many minds.\u201d The Virginia Democrat said that while Biden\u2019s performance in the ABC News interview was largely good, there were some troubling aspects. \u201cInvoking God Almighty as the only intervention that is going to dissuade him from going forward, I hope Joe Biden didn\u2019t really mean that,\u201d Connolly said. Biden hits the trail Biden sought to squash speculation about his future by seeking to project a picture of vigor on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, a state that he must keep in his column in November to keep his hopes of victory alive. The president reflected on faith and the trials it can help surmount at a stop at Philadelphia\u2019s Mount Airy Church of God in Christ. \u201cWe\u2019re all imperfect beings. We don\u2019t know where or what faith will deliver us to or when,\u201d he said, while appearing to read from prepared notes. Black Democratic voters helped to rescue Biden\u2019s primary campaign in 2020 and to put him in the White House. He has been beset by polls in this cycle suggesting Trump is making inroads in a community that usually votes overwhelming for Democratic presidential candidates. Later in the day, Biden moved on to the state capital of Harrisburg, in the company of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a\u00a0Democratic\u00a0rising star\u00a0spoken of as a possible alternative nominee. Biden also traveled with Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, one of the most vehement supporters of his continued reelection campaign, and his old friend Sen. Bob Casey, who is in a tough reelection race, completed the impression of the commonwealth\u2019s top Democrats protecting his back. \u201cThis election is going to be about blocking, tackling simple, basic politics, simple. It\u2019s going to be a matter of how many signs we get out, how many doors we knock on, how many calls we make and how many requests we answer,\u201d Biden told supporters. His campaign has already announced that he plans to campaign in another vital swing state, Michigan, on Friday, following\u00a0this week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington. Hosting world leaders will allow Biden to highlight his credentials as a statesman and one of the most significant aspects of his term \u2014 his reinvigoration and expansion of the Western alliance and the steeling of US allies to meet the threat posed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. If he can successfully navigate the event without more controversy, the focus may begin to turn away from his perceived liabilities and back toward Trump, who is expected to unveil his vice presidential nominee at or ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. By the time Biden is back in the spotlight, there will be even less time ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August for his critics to push any alternative nominee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/biden-fate-political-career/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-democrat-michael-bennet-biden-reelection-cnntv", "text": "Sen. Michael Bennet on Tuesday became the first Democratic senator to publicly say he doesn\u2019t believe President Joe Biden is capable of winning reelection after his disastrous debate performance last month. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cSo for me, this isn\u2019t a question about polling. It\u2019s not a question about politics. It\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country.\u201d \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\u201d the Colorado Democrat said. His comments underscore a growing concern among congressional Democrats that Biden\u2019s reelection bid could hurt the party in down-ballot races this fall. Democrats, including those\u00a0inside the administration, view\u00a0this week as critical to Biden\u2019s political survival,\u00a0and lawmakers\u00a0on Capitol Hill\u00a0gathered privately for their weekly meetings\u00a0on Tuesday.\u00a0Neither\u00a0House nor Senate Democrats emerged from their meetings with a consensus on how to move forward, though it was clear that concerns had been aired behind closed doors. Bennet, who stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw, also warned on \u201cThe Source\u201d about what\u2019s at stake in the 2024 election, saying that losing the House and Senate to Republicans would be \u201can American tragedy.\u201d \u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d he said. Bennet said his voters have \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about whether Biden can win and urged the White House to not ignore worries about his viability. Bennet\u2019s comments confirm earlier CNN reporting that Bennet told his colleagues during the private meeting between Senate Democrats Tuesday that he does not think Biden can win. Biden\u2019s performance at the CNN debate in June kicked off a flurry of concern over his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign. While several House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race, the president has vowed to continue. He told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday \u201cthat despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,\u201d he is \u201cfully committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\u201d Responding to Bennet\u2019s comments, Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to CNN: \u201cThis was always going to be a close race \u2013 and the dynamics at play are the ones we\u2019ve long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\u201d he added. CNN previously reported Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester also said Biden would not win during the meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar. Another source confirmed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told senators at the meeting they should speak with the White House directly. Other senators also said they believed the administration is more receptive to hearing from senators directly. After the meeting ended, many Democratic senators declined to talk to reporters. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, an ally of Biden, was asked if a consensus had been reached in the meeting but only said that \u201cit was a constructive conversation.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-democrat-michael-bennet-biden-reelection-cnntv/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_lbj-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, according to CNN\u2019s latest report. He remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision. Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here\u2019s part of that address: It is a remarkable speech to watch today. Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded. By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson\u2019s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted. Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16. Health was a concern for LBJ Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term. \u201cThere\u2019s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,\u201d Updegrove said. \u201cHe had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn\u2019t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,\u201d Updegrove added. A year of incredible uncertainty 1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson\u2019s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty. Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities. In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent. If Biden decides to step aside this year, Democrats should study what happened in 1968, when they ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside. In November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states. Johnson remains one of the country\u2019s most transformative presidents Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a \u201cgreat society,\u201d including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty. Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/lbj-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_democrats-virtual-roll-call-biden", "text": "The party announced May 28 it would hold a virtual roll call ahead of the Democratic National Convention to comply with Ohio law. That decision \u2013 made well before the June 27 debate \u2013 could now help tamp down efforts to convince the president to step aside after a disappointing performance last month. Amid questions of whether President Joe Biden will remain the Democratic nominee, there is also uncertainty around when delegates will vote to make his nomination official. But it has also led to a flood of questions about when and how Biden will be nominated. As of now, it\u2019s not clear how long delegates \u2013 including the nearly 4,000 pledged to Biden \u2013 will have to vote for the nominee, or when the process will start or end. According to convention nomination talking points circulated by the Democratic National Committee last week, the electronic roll call vote will happen by August 7, but no decisions have been made on the format or timing of the vote. A DNC spokesperson told CNN that no date has been decided for the electronic roll call. Biden, who\u00a0won about 99% of his party\u2019s delegates, is expected to become the official nominee when the vote is complete. The DNC\u2019s convention rules panel is expected to meet July 19 and its credentials committee is expected to meet July 21. Both meetings will be streamed on the committee\u2019s YouTube page. Originally, the electronic roll call was meant to avoid further ballot access issues for the president. Earlier this year, the office of Ohio\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose informed Democrats that their party convention, which will take place from August 19-22, would fall after the state\u2019s deadline for submitting the party\u2019s official nominee. LaRose said he would not accept a provisional certification and efforts to push back the deadline in the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature dragged. After weighing possible options, including litigation, the DNC opted to hold a virtual roll call vote. The committee stuck with the plan even after Ohio enacted a law that would push back the deadline to after the convention. On June 3, LaRose sent guidance to county election officials informing them of the new timeline. One day later, the DNC Rules and Bylaws committee approved an amendment, which was then approved by the full DNC, allowing the DNC convention\u2019s rules and credentials committees to set up the process to conduct the virtual roll call. At that June 4 meeting, DNC Rules and Bylaws committee co-chair Minyon Moore, who also chairs the national convention, argued that the Ohio legislature had proven to be \u201cuntrustworthy stewards of voting rights\u201d in the past, and raised concerns the state could undo their law delaying the certification deadline. She noted that the law delaying the deadline doesn\u2019t go into effect until August 31. \u201cWe cannot leave our democracy or our rights, or the rights of Ohio voters in their hands,\u201d Moore said in the meeting. At the time there were concerns that a virtual roll call would dampen enthusiasm at the actual convention. Carol Fowler, a DNC member on the rules and bylaws committee, urged the committee to make the experience worthwhile for delegates traveling to Chicago during the June 4 meeting. \u201cWhatever you can do to give the actual delegates in the actual convention hall the most opportunity there is to participate and to do things that mean something, not just sit there and listen to speeches,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cGive them some opportunities to vote.\u201d Moore said her team had worked with that in mind. \u201cI assure you that we will be taking all of that into account,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/democrats-virtual-roll-call-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fact-check-biden-campaign-j-d-vance-heritage-foundation", "text": "In two social media posts on Tuesday, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign distorted a quote from Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio to inaccurately make it seem as if Vance had been praising a conservative think tank\u2019s\u00a0Project 2025\u00a0initiative and expressing support for a nationwide abortion ban and cuts to Social Security. Both of the\u00a0\u201cBiden-Harris HQ\u201d\u00a0posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, included a nine-second video of Vance \u2013 a\u00a0possible Republican vice presidential candidate\u00a0\u2013 saying the following in a 2023 speech:\u00a0\u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all of the Heritage Foundation for 50 years of incredible work on conservative policy.\u201d\u00a0Roberts is the president of the think tank. In\u00a0one of the posts, the \u201cBiden-Harris HQ\u201d account claimed that the video showed Vance complimenting Project 2025 in particular.\u00a0Project 2025\u00a0is an extensive Heritage Foundation blueprint for how former President Donald Trump, if elected again, could radically reshape the executive branch and implement right-wing policies. The Biden campaign claimed in\u00a0the other post\u00a0that the video showed Vance praising two unpopular policy proposals. The post said: \u201cTrump VP contender JD Vance thanks Project 2025 leaders for their \u2018incredible work\u2019 of creating a plan for Trump to ban abortion nationwide and cut Social Security.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Both of the Biden campaign posts are false.\u00a0The full video\u00a0of Vance\u2019s speech to the Heritage Foundation shows that he did not mention Project 2025, abortion, or Social Security at all; the 2023 speech was almost entirely about foreign policy, with a dash of criticism of progressives. And the Biden campaign misleadingly edited the Vance sentence it purported to quote, using ellipses to omit the fact that Vance was broadly praising the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work over the last five decades rather than endorsing any particular recent initiative or proposal. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. An edited quote The Biden campaign edited Vance\u2019s quote to make it read as follows:\u00a0\u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all the Heritage Foundation for\u2026 incredible work on [our] policy.\u201d That\u2019s a distortion. Here, again, is what Vance actually said: \u201cI want to thank especially Kevin Roberts and all of the Heritage Foundation for 50 years of incredible work on conservative policy.\u201d So the Biden campaign removed the words \u201c50 years of\u201d and \u201cconservative,\u201d and added the word \u201cour,\u201d to make it sound like Vance was conveying praise of current policies Vance himself had adopted \u2013 rather than general praise for Heritage\u2019s decades of contributions to the conservative movement. What Project 2025 says and what Vance says\u00a0 Vance did\u00a0say\u00a0near the beginning of the speech that the Heritage Foundation \u201cis going to play a major role in helping us figure out how to govern, at the White House, at the Senate, at the House and all across our great country.\u201d But the full Project 2025\u00a0policy document, a 920-page tome called \u201cMandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\u201d was\u00a0not released until the day after Vance\u2019s speech, which he delivered on April 20, 2023. That Project 2025 policy document\u00a0barely mentions Social Security, let alone makes significant proposals on the subject. On abortion, the policy document calls for the Justice Department to enforce a law, first\u00a0passed in the 19th century, that criminalizes the mailing of abortion pills and any other items used in abortions. Critics have\u00a0warned\u00a0that strict enforcement of this law could create a de facto national abortion ban without requiring Congress to pass new legislation. On NBC this past weekend, Vance said he supported the recent Supreme Court decision that allowed abortion medication mifepristone to continue to be mailed to patients without an in-person visit to a doctor. On CBS in May 2024, he\u00a0avoided taking a position\u00a0when asked what minimum national standard on abortion he would support, nodding toward Trump\u2019s stated position that abortion policy will be determined by individual states. Vance is opposed to abortion; on the website for his 2022 campaign for the Senate, he\u00a0declared himself\u00a0\u201c100 percent pro-life\u201d and called for \u201celiminating abortion.\u201d However, he\u00a0said\u00a0on CNN in December 2023: \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans. They just don\u2019t. And I say that as a person who wants to protect as many unborn babies as possible. We have to provide exceptions for life of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fact-check-biden-campaign-j-d-vance-heritage-foundation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters", "text": "It is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign. But it is rare, and no president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness. One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than President Joe Biden would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns. Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that if Biden were to drop out now \u2013 something he has so far shown no sign of doing \u2013 it would be the latest such decision in history. Johnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does. Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right. But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection. Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House. Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden still has Democratic nomination sewn up, and he would have to choose to give it up. Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate. Roosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another. Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten\u00a0strips of paper\u00a0given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election.\u00a0The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise. Three 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats. James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said: Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents. Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president. Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction. Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876. Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate. For Democrats today, holding on to at least one lever of power in Washington is a major priority as they fret over a possible second Trump term. If Biden becomes convinced that his own candidacy risks a Democratic wipeout, he might be swayed to step aside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/politics/joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_trump-burgum-rubio-running-mate", "text": "Former President Donald Trump, nearing an announcement of his running mate, said Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s an issue\u201d that North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a near-total abortion ban in his state. The comments from the presumptive GOP nominee mark the latest insight he\u2019s shared about some of the top names thought to be under consideration for his vice presidential pick ahead of next week\u2019s Republican National Convention. He also weighed in Wednesday on Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s residency, saying it \u201cmakes it more complicated\u201d since they both live in the Sunshine State. Asked about Burgum as a potential pick, Trump told Fox News Radio, \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of an issue. It\u2019s a pretty strong ban.\u201d Trump, who wants abortion to be left to the states to legislate, has said he thinks Republicans who support hardline bans on the procedure have suffered at the ballot box in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, though he regularly champions his role in building the conservative court majority that made that decision. \u201cYou know, I think Doug is great. But it is a strong, he\u2019s taken a very strong stance, or the state has, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Doug, but the state has, so it\u2019s an issue.\u201d Burgum signed the law, which only allows exceptions for rape or incest within the first six weeks of pregnancy, last year. Trump and Rubio both live in Florida, and while there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0the Constitution dictates that state electors must vote for a president and vice president \u201cone of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\u201d Trump said Rubio\u2019s residency wouldn\u2019t preclude the senator from being the pick, but said, \u201cIt makes it more complicated. There are people that don\u2019t have that complication. Now, it\u2019s fairly easily fixed, but you have to do something with delegates, or there has to be a resignation, you know, etc., etc.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s not like picking some people where it\u2019s very easy, where there is none of that,\u201d Trump continued. Rubio said Wednesday that getting around the residency issue to serve as vice president is \u201cnot without precedent\u201d and suggested he\u2019d be willing to serve in the role. \u201cAt this time in our history, given everything that we\u2019ve gone through, if someone has an opportunity to serve this country at that capacity, unless there\u2019s some reason why you can\u2019t do it, you almost have to say yes, especially if you care about public service as much as I do,\u201d Rubio told Fox Business. Rubio spoke at Trump\u2019s rally Tuesday at his golf course in Doral, Florida, where the former president continued to build suspense around his selection. \u201cI think they probably think I\u2019m going to be announcing that Marco\u2019s gonna be vice president,\u201d Trump said as he alluded to the media presence at his rally. Trump was also asked Wednesday whether Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance wouldn\u2019t be his pick because of his beard after a report from The Bulwark about Trump not liking facial hair. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never heard that one,\u201d Trump said, adding that he thought the Ohio Republican \u201clooks good\u201d and \u201clooks like a young Abraham Lincoln.\u201d Trump has said in recent interviews that he wants to announce his running mate at the GOP convention, which is taking place next week in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but said it could also happen right before the convention. The presumptive GOP nominee, who has said he doesn\u2019t think President Joe Biden would exit the presidential race, said Wednesday during the radio interview that he hoped Biden would be the Democratic nominee because, \u201cWe planned for him.\u201d Trump suggested in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday that uncertainty around Biden\u2019s status as the Democratic nominee was a factor in his running mate selection. \u201cI haven\u2019t made final decisions, but I have some ideas as to where we\u2019re going. And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they\u2019re doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure that it would,\u201d Trump said. This story has been updated with additional reaction.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_biden-nato-analysis", "text": "The NATO summit was long planned to celebrate the alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary, to lock in longterm military support for Ukraine and even to future-proof the West against a possible second term for Donald Trump. But no one expected the meeting in Washington this week to turn into a public test of 81-year-old President Joe Biden\u2019s health and cognitive capacity with his reelection campaign facing an existential moment after his disastrous debate performance. Biden\u2019s leadership of NATO and lifeline to Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion make him the most significant presidential trustee of the alliance since President George H.W. Bush. But his achievements, including Sweden and Finland\u2019s entry into the group, will be eclipsed at the summit by his battle to save his political future. Every step Biden takes, every gesture he makes, and every word he utters will be under intense scrutiny, especially in unscripted moments after the image of an aged and at times incoherent commander in chief was burned into the minds of 50 million viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta late last month. A president who is older than the alliance itself will be under enormous pressure to show vigor and mental clarity at a solo news conference on Thursday. Any hint of confusion or weakness could spark a fresh round of panic among Democrats and derail Biden\u2019s aggressive effort to quell talk of him abandoning his campaign. The president can expect a volley of questions about his health, his medical records and whether he has been hiding the true details of his condition from journalists infuriated by the White House\u2019s handling of the debate fallout. The press conference will also be a must-see event for Democrats who are demanding he do far more to prove he is fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, warned Monday evening, \u201cWe need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job.\u201d It was a strikingly strong statement by the Washington state Democrat that underscored the vulnerability of Biden\u2019s position. She added: \u201cAt this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.\u201d Biden will also have an important audience overseas. The effects of the president\u2019s advancing age are not just an issue for his political future; they are now the West\u2019s problem given that he is the last defense against a stunning comeback by Trump, who spent his first term berating NATO allies and cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has suggested he would let Moscow \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d and would not honor NATO\u2019s sacred Article 5 mutual defense principle if he considered that a member state had not met the alliance\u2019s defense spending guidelines. World leaders will be keen to make their own assessment of Biden Biden\u2019s debacle created a new complication for US allies already formulating plans for a possibility that many of them dread \u2014 a Trump victory in November. The world leaders who will spend hours with Biden this week are therefore certain to make their own assessments of the president and his political hopes. Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO, said Biden\u2019s partners will arrive in Washington looking for both political and strategic assurances about Biden and the United States\u2019 future role as the leader of NATO. \u201cIs it going to be President Biden? Is he capable of that? Is he going to run for reelection, is he going to get reelected? If so, what does that look like?\u201d Volker told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Monday. Allies are also looking toward an uncertain future, Volker said. \u201cThen they worry \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t do that and it\u2019s former president Donald Trump coming back, what does that mean for US support for NATO, US support for Ukraine?\u201d Foreign diplomats and governments are loath to speak about Biden\u2019s plight on the record out of a desire to avoid being dragged into domestic US politics. But diplomats from Europe, Asia and the Middle East expressed disbelief at his debate showing, CNN reported last week. And looking forward to the summit, one European diplomat said leaders from the continent would stay polite and seek to avoid any accusations of interference or taking sides in US politics. But the person added: \u201cBeneath this cool surface, I believe (the) Biden debate is very crucial. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe there are many Europeans who could see how Biden could still be a successful candidate.\u201d Another European diplomat said that \u201cevery leader arriving in Washington in the coming days will ask questions about (Biden\u2019s position) and there will be lot of speculation, but the NATO echo chamber doesn\u2019t change the US domestic political calculus in any way.\u201d The furor over Biden\u2019s age is just the latest shock to rattle the certainty that NATO partners placed in the United States as the alliance\u2019s senior member for more than 60 years \u2013 through and after the Cold War until Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House. America\u2019s political paroxysms have left many allies, especially in Europe, considering how to protect themselves in an age when Washington is just as likely to be an agent of volatility as stability. Some question whether the US will be there to defend them anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality that we have to be prepared for the unpredictability of the US ally,\u201d a European official said. US officials reject any suggestion of concern among Biden\u2019s partners about his capacity to lead the alliance, even as multiple polls show most Americans believe he is too old to serve a second term. \u201cForeign leaders have seen Joe Biden up close and personal for the last three years. They know who they are dealing with and how effective he\u2019s been,\u201d a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity. The administration\u2019s national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday denied that foreign leaders needed to be assured about Biden\u2019s capacities. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all. Quite the contrary,\u201d he said. The critical national security substance of the summit is unlikely to be adversely affected by Biden\u2019s political crisis since diplomats and top military brass have been thrashing out deliverables for months. They\u2019ve focused on institutionalizing aid to Ukraine and on the future relationship between the alliance and the Kyiv government and its desire to eventually join the alliance. After months of diplomatic haggling, a draft text of the final summit communique describes Ukraine as having an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to membership, three sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN. Biden\u2019s political storm shows no sign of abating These are surreal days in Washington, with a sitting president waging a battle to remain atop his party\u2019s ticket less than four months from Election Day. On Monday, the president insisted he wasn\u2019t going anywhere even as worried Democratic lawmakers discussed whether Biden would cost his party the House and the Senate as well as the presidency if he remains their presidential candidate. Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, joined lawmakers calling for Biden to fold his reelection bid. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message. The president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way,\u201d the Washington state Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday. After days of conflicting statements about the president\u2019s medical situation, the White House, meanwhile, insisted that it was \u201cnot warranted\u201d for the president to have a new cognitive test and didn\u2019t fully explain why a physician who specializes in Parkinson\u2019s disease had held a meeting with the president\u2019s doctor earlier this year. Biden had earlier called into MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d to underscore his refusal to cede his campaign in a manner that indicated that any subsequent request from Democratic leaders for him to leave the ticket would cause an ugly political spectacle. Biden also seized on the upcoming summit as proof of his leadership skills and success as president, while his campaign sought to use his turn on the global stage on US soil to reset the comparison between him and Trump \u2014 the core theme of his campaign, which has been obliterated by his dismal night at the debate. \u201cThe rest of the world is looking \u2014 our allies are looking for US leadership. Who else \u2014 who else do you think could step in here and do this?\u201d Biden said on MSNBC. In an interview with ABC News on Friday, the president also billed himself as essential to global security. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that put NATO together, the future. No one thought I could expand it. I\u2019m the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen,\u201d Biden said. The president has not shut Putin down \u2014 the brutal Russian daylight air attack on Kyiv that hit a children\u2019s hospital on Monday is proof of that. But he has mustered the most effective arming of a Russian adversary since the US backed the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet Union in the 1980s and has indeed reinvigorated NATO and presided over the two Nordic nations entering the alliance. On the eve of the summit, Biden\u2019s campaign distributed a memo lauding his leadership in keeping Kyiv standing more than two years after the Russian invasion. \u201cDonald Trump is a threat to NATO, a gift to Putin and a wrecking ball to global peace, democracy and human rights,\u201d the memo read. The campaign also pointed out the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s frequent genuflecting toward Putin. \u201cThe eyes of the world will be on the NATO summit this week, where Joe Biden has strengthened, expanded and led the NATO Alliance against Putin\u2019s violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and unwarranted aggression.\u201d It will not be much comfort to Biden, but he is not the only NATO leader who is politically weakened. French President Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Washington after triggering a new era of political instability. His ordering of snap legislative elections to thwart the rise of the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen failed to produce a governing majority and empowered the far-left. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is weakened after his party and coalition took a beating in European Parliament elections. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing intense speculation about his future ahead of next year\u2019s general election after his Liberal Party lost an election in a Toronto district it had held for decades. The thorny question of Biden\u2019s age will also be underscored in summit photos since many of the leaders are far younger than a president born during World War II whose foreign policy expertise is honed from a half century of political experience spanning the Cold War and the increasingly restive period ever since. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is 47, for example. And Macron is 46. Trudeau has been in power for nearly a decade but is still only 52. The summit will also mark the international debut of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, 61, who was elected last Thursday. Biden has been a steadfast guide for NATO ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has made the survival of global democracy the cornerstone of his presidency. But he has a far more urgent priority at the summit this week \u2013 saving himself.

{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_biden-abc-interview-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s struggle to prove he\u2019s got the strength and cognitive capacity for a second term is becoming an excruciating personal and national ordeal. Watching a visibly aged Biden answer frank questions Friday about his health on primetime television \u2013 which would normally remain between a patient and their doctor \u2013 felt like an affront to presidential dignity. It was sad to see a person who\u2019s respected and beloved by many Americans suffer such a plight. And it would be a hard heart that did not empathize with Biden as he confronts the painful human realities of aging in the most public manner imaginable. Yet Biden\u2019s position, his shocking presidential debate performance and his defiant refusal to contemplate its implications for his reelection campaign, mean he\u2019s forcing the country to have the conversation. The political tide may be turning against Biden, but the interview underscored his deep pride in a presidency that it took him nearly half a century to achieve. And he\u2019s not close to giving up his lifelong mantra to stand up and fight when he\u2019s knocked down \u2013 a factor that will exacerbate the Democratic Party\u2019s dilemma. While his interview performance was far stronger than the president\u2019s often incoherent showing at the CNN debate in Atlanta, that\u2019s not saying much. It did not contain any new disasters that would push him immediately out of the race. But it equally did little to quell the storm assailing his campaign and raised fresh intrigue about his health amid increasing signs his Democratic power base is beginning to crack. It\u2019s becoming clear that the president, his party and the country are slipping inexorably into a political crisis that raises the extraordinary possibility that a presumptive nominee could be pushed aside weeks before his party\u2019s national convention and four months before one of the most critical elections in history. The threats to Biden\u2019s prospects are quickly mounting. Two more Democratic congressman Friday called on the president to cede the nomination to a younger candidate. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner moved forward with an effort to get Senate Democrats on the same page about Biden\u2019s future and is reaching a place where he thinks it\u2019s time for Biden to suspend his campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. And House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting with ranking party committee members as he faces increasing pressure from his conference over Biden\u2019s position, a Democratic lawmaker said. A test set by the campaign Biden\u2019s campaign had scheduled the interview with ABC News to try to prove that the president\u2019s stumbling debate performance last week was an aberration and to shut down growing doubts about his position as his party\u2019s 2024 nominee. He appeared more composed and fluent than at the CNN debate. He made a far more robust argument for his own successes in office and more effectively prosecuted a case against Trump than he did in the debate. And he dug in deeper despite calls by a handful of a Democratic lawmakers for him to fold his reelection bid and the growing panic among many others yet to break cover. He also dismissed concerns about his health, insisting that he was not frailer than before. \u201cCan I run the 100 (in) 10 flat? No, but I\u2019m still in good shape,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,\u201d Biden said in the interview conducted in swing state Wisconsin. \u201cIf the Lord Almighty came down and said, \u2018Joe, get out of the race,\u2019 I\u2019d get out of the race,\u201d Biden said, but added: \u201cThe Lord Almighty\u2019s not coming down.\u201d But Biden\u2019s admission that he felt \u201cterrible\u201d in the days before his clash with the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump only posed new questions about his health. Those questions come at a time of growing anxiety that he\u2019s well enough at 81 to shoulder the exhausting demands of the presidency and the strain of a reelection bid. Biden compounded those doubts by seeming unsure about whether he\u2019d watched a playback of the debate \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no,\u201d he said when asked if he\u2019d watched the event \u2013 and other moments in which he trailed off in some sentences. And he added yet another explanation for his poor debate performance to add to his allies\u2019 claims he was overloaded with facts by staff, jet-lagged and suffering from a cold. The president said Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking even though his microphone was muted had put him off. Asked whether he was the same man who took office three years ago, Biden deflected by offering a litany of his achievements. \u201cIn terms of successes, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be coming to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.\u201d The president was adamant that the debate was a only \u201ca bad night\u201d for which he took responsibility. But more than a week after the event, and amid rising fear among Democrats about his prospects in November and the possibility of what it will mean for democracy if Trump wins a second term, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. One bad night on such a high-profile stage before millions of viewers may be all it takes to irretrievably damage the campaign of president who will be 82 two weeks after Election Day, who large majorities of Americans worry is unfit to serve and who is asking the country to keep him in office until January 2029. Americans are worried about the next four years, not the last three Biden and his supporters warn that his painful 90 minutes on stage in Atlanta should not overshadow the achievements of his time in office. And they say that the threat posed by Trump and his autocratic instincts and vow to dedicate a second presidency to \u201cretribution\u201d far outweigh concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity. But the question that millions of Americans are asking has less to do with a review of Biden\u2019s first-term legacy and is more about whether he can function for four more grueling White House years. The interview also begged the question of whether the president is fully aware of the corrosive impact of the debate on confidence among Democrats over his chances of beating Trump. He quarreled with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos over polling that showed him slipping further behind the former president nationally and in swing states. The interview was one of a series of events, including the Friday rally and a planned news conference at the NATO summit next week in Washington, that the campaign has held up as moments to prove Biden\u2019s fitness. But Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California told CNN that the president needed to do a prolonged and live television interview unlike the recorded one on ABC. Other members are demanding the president get out far more to prove his stamina, even though the campaign on Friday promised an \u201caggressive\u201d program of events in July. But that pledge did not stop the growing demands for Biden to step aside. \u201cPresident Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington\u2019s, footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Massachusetts Rep. Seth\u00a0Moulton\u00a0told Boston radio station WBUR in an interview that went out before the ABC interview aired. And\u00a0Illinois Rep. Mike\u00a0Quigley\u00a0said Biden\u2019s continued presence in the race has \u201calmost no hope of succeeding.\u201d \u201cI would say Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing you can do now to cement that for all-time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this,\u201d\u00a0Quigley told MSNBC.\u00a0He later added on CNN: \u201cWhat we need right now \u2013 and what I think takes a spine \u2013 is to step aside and recognize the president of the United States doesn\u2019t have the vigor necessary to overcome the deficit here and it\u2019s going to affect us all.\u201d Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Maura\u00a0Healey did not go quite so far but said in a statement to CNN that Biden needed to \u201ccarefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate is especially painful for Democrats because many of them believe that the president has done a good job in reviving the post-Covid-19 economy, powering job growth, harnessing US allies overseas and passing big-ticket infrastructure and climate change plans. But increasingly, it seems as though the fear of a Trump term may be overwhelming satisfaction with Biden\u2019s achievements. To temper such worries, Biden used the rally to pivot from questions about his age to try to refocus attention on what he\u2019d actually done in office. \u201cI keep seeing all\u00a0those stories about I\u2019m being too\u00a0old,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me say something. I wasn\u2019t too\u00a0old\u00a0to create over 15 million new jobs. To make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act. Was I too\u00a0old\u00a0to release student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too\u00a0old\u00a0to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in the United States of America?\u201d After the debate, Biden\u2019s every word is under intense scrutiny and risks bolstering a critical narrative about his age and mental acuity after he seared an image of a struggling, president diminished by age in the mind of viewers. So, one fatalistic statement in the ABC interview about how he\u2019d feel next January if Trump won is likely to inflame concerns of many Democrats about his mindset, his understanding of his situation and what will happen in November. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said. The Biden campaign later contacted CNN to argue that the president had not said \u201cgoodest\u201d and ABC News changed its transcript of the interview to read \u201cI did the good as job as I know I can do.\u201d An editor\u2019s note said the transcript was \u201cupdated for clarity.\u201d The audio of the sentence is not conclusive on the question. But the situation underscored the extent to which every word the president utters following the debate is under the highest scrutiny.

The\u00a0president told The Chronicle\u00a0he had been trying to \u201ctrack down\u201d the governor to start the process of requesting aid. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to track down the governor to see \u2013 I don\u2019t have the authority to do that without a specific request from the governor,\u201d Biden told the paper. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has been in Asia for the past several days, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has assumed the role of acting governor during the state\u2019s response to the storm in his absence. The White House told the paper that officials have tried to reach Patrick and Abbott \u201cmultiple times.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for two days and we finally got the request,\u201d Biden said, according to The Chronicle. \u201cWe positioned an awful lot of stuff in Texas ahead of time, but I had to get a specific request for this.\u201d Biden\u2019s statements to The Chronicle are a rare example of the president publicly airing disagreements with state officials as they contend with a major natural disaster. Presidents, including Biden, have typically worked to focus on unity and reaching across the aisle in the wake of major storms. Touring Louisiana in 2021 after a hurricane struck that state,\u00a0Biden said\u00a0\u201cthere\u2019s nothing political about this. It\u2019s just simply about saving lives and getting people back up and running, and we\u2019re in this together.\u201d Patrick rejected Biden\u2019s characterization of the White House\u2019s outreach, accused him of politicizing the deadly storm. Beryl made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Texas on Monday, and Patrick said he first spoke with the president on Tuesday. \u201cI am disappointed that President Biden is turning Hurricane Beryl into a political issue,\u201d\u00a0Patrick said on X.\u00a0\u201cWe had a cordial call today that ended up with him granting my request for a major disaster declaration. But that\u2019s not good enough for him. He is falsely accusing me that I was not reachable. He obviously did not know his own employees from FEMA were side-by-side with me for 3 days! All he had to do was call them and have them hand their phone to me.\u201d State officials, Patrick wrote, had to determine Texas\u2019 needs before asking the federal government for help \u2013 a process that required officials traveling to impacted areas. \u201cTo quote President Biden, this is a load of malarkey, and he\u2019s shoveling it!\u201d Patrick wrote, using a term often used by Biden. Abbott, in his own post, took aim at Biden\u2019s mental fitness. \u201cBiden\u2019s memory fails again,\u201d the governor tweeted, adding that Biden has his number and \u201cnot once did he call me during Beryl.\u201d Abbott spokesperson Andrew Mahaleris also called Biden\u2019s comments \u201ca complete lie,\u201d\u00a0writing on X: \u201cBiden and his Administration know exactly how to get in contact with the Governor and have on numerous occasions in the past, most recently on Friday when FEMA called and spoke with him.\u201d Since making landfall earlier this week, Beryl has killed at least eight people in Texas and Louisiana and has left more than 2 million customers without power. Biden\u2019s interview with The Chronicle comes as the White House and Biden campaign have been working to get the president face time with more journalists in the wake of his faltering performance at last month\u2019s presidential debate. Patrick has been critical of Biden\u2019s debate performance, saying that he \u201clooked totally lost\u201d and that \u201cit was a Trump knockout in every round.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/biden-abbott-patrick-texas-hurricane-beryl-aid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_fake-electors-get-tapped-as-gop-convention-delegates", "text": "Seven battleground states are sending fake electors and others who worked to upend the 2020 election results to represent their state parties at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where they will officially anoint Donald Trump as their presidential nominee. The fake electors and other election deniers identified by CNN include several who are currently facing criminal charges for\u00a0their efforts\u00a0in helping Trump try to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. They hail from the states that were central to that plot last presidential cycle: Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada,\u00a0New Mexico\u00a0and Wisconsin,\u00a0according to lists published by state parties and other documents obtained by CNN. They\u2019ve been selected to serve as national committee members, delegates or alternates with one clear task: Make Trump\u2019s nomination official. Their role underscores how Trump has effectively woven election denialism into the GOP\u2019s platform. It also marks an about face for a party that, at least in the immediate aftermath of the\u00a0January 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol, sought to distance itself from Trump and his\u00a0efforts to\u00a0stay in power. \u201cElection denialism is like the price of entry now,\u201d according to former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a CNN contributor who served on the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6 US Capitol riot and has endorsed Biden for president in 2024. \u201cThese people that were in the fake elector scheme, or got a mug shot, they\u2019re now the heroes of the movement, and they\u2019ve taken over the party,\u201d Kinzinger added. Anna Kelly, a spokesman for the RNC, noted that Republican activists are responsible for electing their convention representatives. \u201cState delegations are made up of delegates elected by their peers at the state party level,\u201d Kelly said. From fringe elements to key players The Arizona delegation includes three fake electors who have been charged in that state for their alleged roles in the plot, including\u00a0state Sen. Jake Hoffman\u00a0who was recently elected to be a Republican National Committee member. Hoffman has pleaded not guilty. In Georgia,\u00a0Amy Kremer\u00a0\u2013 who\u00a0helped organize the\u00a0January 6\u00a0rally\u00a0on the Ellipse ahead of the Capitol attack\u00a0but has not been accused of any criminal activity\u00a0\u2013 was chosen to serve on the Republican National Committee. Michigan\u2019s delegation counts four individuals facing criminal charges brought by prosecutors in that state. The group includes former\u00a0Michigan GOP co-chair and fake elector\u00a0Meshawn\u00a0Maddock\u00a0who has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Matthew DePerno, a failed candidate for Michigan attorney general who recently announced a run for the state Supreme Court, is also headed to the convention. He too faces criminal charges for allegedly plotting to access and seize voting machines. He\u2019s denied any wrongdoing. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone from fringe elements of the party to, now, officially party members in good standing with perceived power,\u201d Kinzinger said, referring to those delegates who participated in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The Democratic National Committee also panned the roster headed to Milwaukee. \u201cThis kind of far-right MAGA extremism on full display in today\u2019s GOP is exactly why voters will reject Trump this November,\u201d said Alex Floyd, a DNC spokesperson. High honor Nearly\u00a05,000\u00a0delegates and alternates are set to convene in Wisconsin for the Republican Party\u2019s four-day confab\u00a0beginning July 15 in Milwaukee.\u00a0They\u2019ll descend from all 50 states and six territories. And they\u2019ll gather on the convention floor, sporting flamboyant hats and pledging their support to Trump. The convention comes just months after Trump effectively remade the Republican National Committee in his image. Committee members selected Trump ally Michael Whatley to take over as party chair and Lara Trump, Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, now serves as co-chair. Other senior Trump campaign advisers have taken on roles with the RNC, alongside their campaign duties. For the newly elected members of the RNC, the convention is a chance to gladhand and make their new role known. Their four-year term officially begins at the end of the convention. From there, they will take on responsibilities that could shape the GOP\u2019s future spending, fundraising, primary debates and next nominating convention. \u201cFor a lot of people, it is a high honor. You are delegate to a presidential nominating committee and taking an important step in our country\u2019s democracy and history,\u201d said Douglas Heye, a GOP political strategist who once served as communications director for the Republican National Committee. This year, those positions will be held by some Republicans who nearly undermined the democratic process in 2020. \u201cThe first conventions I was going to, character matters was a big part of Republican messaging,\u201d Heye said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really talk about that anymore. And this is a manifest of that.\u201d State cases against fake electors Prosecutors in five of the seven hotly contested states last presidential cycle brought charges against dozens of Republicans who served as alternate electors or Trump allies who allegedly orchestrated the plot to overturn the election results. But the cases have mostly plodded along. In Nevada,\u00a0a judge recently dismissed\u00a0the criminal charges against the GOP electors because of an issue about where the case was brought. At this stage, none of the four remaining state-level criminal cases is likely to be resolved before the 2024 election. The slow progress of the criminal cases has left those who worked to overturn the last presidential election free to continue openly participating in the political process, cheered along by GOP activists,\u00a0many of whom share in their baseless claims that the 2020 election was somehow rigged against Trump. In Nevada, well before the charges were dismissed, the Republican Party selected five of the six fake electors from 2020 to attend the Republican National Convention. New Mexico included just one of the alternate GOP electors \u2013 who has not been accused of criminal activity \u2013 in its convention delegation. Pennsylvania is sending three fake electors to represent the state party in Milwaukee. While the GOP electors from Pennsylvania have not faced criminal prosecution, several played an active role in trying to upend the last presidential election. That includes Thomas Carroll,\u00a0a Pennsylvania attorney who represented two local county commissioners\u00a0as part of a legal dispute about voting machine breaches. During the civil litigation, Carroll and the county were both sanctioned by the state\u2019s Supreme Court for defying a court order blocking their access to the machines, but they face no criminal charges. Remorse and defiance To be sure, some state level Republicans who participated in the fake elector scheme after the 2020 election have since expressed remorse for their actions. In\u00a0December,\u00a0the 10\u00a0fake electors from Wisconsin\u00a0disavowed their attempt to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020\u00a0and recognized the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s victory as part of a civil lawsuit settlement. In a rare moment of accountability, they even issued a statement acknowledging that the phony certificates they signed in December 2020 were \u201cused as part of an attempt to improperly overturn\u201d the lawful election results. The Wisconsin Republicans pledged\u00a0not to serve as real electors in 2024 or any election when Trump is on the ballot, or to act as sham electors in any future election, as part of the civil settlement. But it didn\u2019t place any restrictions on other roles they could play. One of Wisconsin\u2019s fake electors, Pam Travis, is headed to the convention as a delegate. Another, Robert Spindell, is set to serve as an alternate.\u00a0Neither have been charged with any crimes. Ahead of November, many of the 2020 fake electors have remained defiant. \u201cThe American people are awake to the perverse weaponization of government at the hands of power-hungry Democrats, which is why people are flocking to the Republican Party, President Trump, and the principles of liberty like never before, and my election as RNC National Committeeman for Arizona is proof positive that Republicans are the Party of everyday, hard working Americans,\u201d Hoffman, one of the Arizona fake electors, said in a statement to CNN. Hoffman has pleaded not guilty and slammed the charges against him, telling CNN in a statement: \u201cLet me be unequivocal, I am innocent of any crime, I will vigorously defend myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this naked political persecution by the judicial process.\u201d Maddock, one of the Michigan fake electors who has pleaded not guilty, has\u00a0also\u00a0called the prosecution against her \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and continues to claim that Trump won the 2020 election.\u00a0 She responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment but did not address questions about her role as a fake elector and the significance of being chosen as a delegate. DePerno, also facing state charges in Michigan, shared a statement with CNN that said, in part: \u201cYou should actually do some research. So now is a good time to point out that not only are so-called \u2018election deniers\u2019 (what a dumb term) staying involved, we are planning on winning.\u201d In Georgia,\u00a0Kremer has also parroted the lie that Trump won\u00a0a state he lost by some 12,000 votes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell people to go to the Capitol. But the thing was, the people wanted to do something. So people marched to the Capitol,\u201d\u00a0Kremer said in April, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0\u201cAnd we all know what\u2019s happened since then. The federal government has been weaponized against us.\u201d Kremer told CNN in a statement that she is \u201chonored and excited to be part of a new generation of leadership recently elected to the RNC and am blessed to represent Georgia on the committee.\u201d \u201cI look forward to working with my fellow colleagues at the RNC to secure our elections and make sure Donald J Trump is elected President in November,\u201d she\u00a0 added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fake-electors-get-tapped-as-gop-convention-delegates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_biden-rare-challenge-solo-news-conference", "text": "President Joe Biden will hold a closely watched news conference on Thursday, marking another high-stakes moment for the president to show off his skill in answering questions in an unscripted setting. The appearance will come\u00a0at the conclusion of a critical NATO summit where foreign diplomats will have a front row seat to observe his ability to lead on the global stage. Biden has held a historically low number of news conferences compared to his most recent predecessors \u2013 and has been encouraged by his top allies to lean into more \u201coff-the-cuff,\u201d casual moments in the aftermath of last month\u2019s debate performance. When he takes the podium Thursday evening, it will be just the 15th time Biden has held a solo news conference, and the first time since November 2023 \u2013 an engagement that ran 21 minutes. His average solo news conference has been roughly 37 minutes long. There is a possibility that the strategy telegraphed by his team to accelerate the president\u2019s schedule and spontaneous engagements will not have its desired outcome. But in recent days, Biden\u2019s team has leaned into\u00a0their plans\u00a0with stops at a church and campaign office in Philadelphia, a community event and a coffee shop in Harrisburg, a 22-minute interview with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos and an 18-minute call-in to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d\u00a0Biden\u2019s team is already looking ahead to the next unscripted engagement, teasing an interview with NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt set for Monday. Despite the unscripted plans, Biden and his team have previously sought to control what he\u2019s asked when. At his most recent June 13 news conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when a reporter asked him a question about a Hamas-Israel ceasefire, Biden expressed frustration with the reporter for going off-topic. \u201cI wish you guys would play by the rules a little bit. I\u2019m here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine \u2013\u00a0you ask me on other subjects. I\u2019ll be happy to answer in detail later,\u201d he said, a response that received condemnation from the White House Correspondents Association. The president is expected to give brief remarks at the beginning before taking questions from reporters, a White House official said. Biden has held 36 news conferences to date, including 14 solo and 22 joint news conferences alongside other world leaders. He has participated three joint news conferences so far this year: the June 13 presser with Zelensky in Italy, on May 23 alongside Kenya President William Ruto at the White House, and on April 10 with Japan Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, also at the White House. Former President Donald Trump, by contrast, held 88 news conferences overall during his presidency, and at the same point in his presidency, he had held 64 news conferences,\u00a016 of which were solo, according to an analysis of University of California at Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project data. Former President Barack Obama held 163 news conferences and had held 72 at this point in his presidency,\u00a032 of which were solo. And former President George W. Bush held 210 news conferences during his presidency, and 82 at this point in his presidency,\u00a015 of which were solo. Recent presidents who had held\u00a0fewer\u00a0news conferences at this point include former President Ronald Reagan, at 25, and former President Richard Nixon, at 24. Biden has been under intense scrutiny since the debate, with heightened attention on every verbal slip, diversion and moment of confusion. Close observers of the president have noted that his speech and delivery have lost some pacing, crispness and focus in the years since he took office. Biden has been largely insulated from potential signs of aging by his team, with strategies including short, tightly scripted\u00a0events in which the president reads from a\u00a0teleprompter; the use of shorter steps on Air Force One; and significantly pared-back engagement with reporters compared with his most recent predecessors. But some Democrats are increasingly convinced that those efforts were less aimed at preventing spoken gaffes or freewheeling diversions and more focused on eliminating more alarming incidents showing a weakened, aging president in recent months. Biden, who has a long history of verbal gaffes, further raised questions about the effectiveness of a strategy\u00a0when he went off the cuff last week. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be, as I said, the first vice president \u2013 first Black woman \u2013 to serve with a Black president, proud to have been involved with the first Black woman on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said during\u00a0a radio interview that aired July 4. Reached for comment\u00a0that\u00a0night, a Biden campaign spokesperson slammed the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of criticism of the president\u2019s missteps. \u201cIt was clear what President Biden meant when he was talking about his historic record including a record number of appointments to the federal bench,\u201d spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. And the response to a question from Stephanopoulos about how he\u2019d feel in January if Trump won did little to curb deepening concerns from Democrats. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said Friday.\u00a0The quote was also transcribed by other outlets as Biden saying he \u201cdid the goodest job\u201d he can do, which is how ABC originally transcribed the quote before changing it in a later version of their transcript. Biden has remained dug in, emphatically dismissing any suggestion that he\u2019s not the most qualified candidate to beat Trump in November and vowing to stay in the race. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be able to hold NATO together like me? Who\u2019s going to be able to be in a position where I\u2019m able to keep the Pacific basin in a position where we\u2019re at least check being in China now? Who\u2019s going to \u2013 who\u2019s going to do that? Who has that reach?\u201d Biden asked during his interview with Stephanopoulos last week. He added, \u201cI guess a real good way to judge me is you\u2019re going to have now the NATO Conference here in the United States next week. Come listen.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_global-elections-roundup", "text": "A year of global elections, in which nations with half the world\u2019s population are casting votes is proving punishing for incumbents struggling with the painful economic aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the scandals and exhaustion that afflict leaders who spend years in power. Elections in recent days in France and Britain have shown disgruntled but informed electorates using democracy in novel ways through tactical voting to reshape their countries. In Iran \u2013 even amid the highly restrictive circumstances of an election choreographed by the clerical autocracy, voters sprung a surprise and a hardliner lost. So far, this mass global exercise of political self-determination has done as much to highlight the growing threats to democracy, the rule of law and the rise of populist leaders as to enshrine the principle that people should choose their leaders. In some countries, like El Salvador and Slovakia, leaders and parties with authoritarian instincts have cemented their power through the ballot box. In others, like Russia, they\u2019ve strangled the rights of voters to extend their own rule. And there are rising concerns about how new leaders with strong mandates in nations like Indonesia and Mexico could use their power to centralize authority and erode democratic structures. For leaders seeking reelection this year, there are sobering omens. Incumbency usually means vulnerability \u2014 as a landmark vote in South Africa demonstrated \u2014 and there is widespread angst in developed societies over cost-of-living crises. Populism is having another moment to mirror Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in 2016, which was quickly followed by Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the United States. But democracy\u2019s enduring capacity to channel public anger against the power of dominant leaders or to force change has also been on display from India to Senegal. And elections in Taiwan and South Korea proved the dynamism of the idea that free elections can promote stable governance. Voting around the world is leading up to a critical election in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy \u2013 the United States \u2013 in November. President Joe Biden, weakened by a disastrous debate performance that exacerbated voter concern about his age, is warning that a return to power by Trump \u2014 who tried to steal the 2020 election after losing it \u2014 poses an existential threat to the principle of government of the people, by the people and for the people across the globe. Here are some of the most significant election results so far in 2024 that underscore what may turn out to be a pivotal moment for democracy. European Union The far-right made significant gains in elections to the European Parliament in June, though the populist wave fell short of some of the direst predictions of critics who warn that the continent\u2019s democratic heritage could be at risk. Still, the fact that the ultra-conservatives\u00a0did best in European Union powerhouses France and Germany is hugely significant. Despite the shuffled political deck, the center-right European People\u2019s Party remains the biggest single force in pan-EU politics and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to secure another term. France Sweeping gains by the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen in the European elections prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to make a shock call for new legislative elections, as he pleaded with voters to neutralize the growing threat of extremism. The two round French election system once again kept the far-right out of power on Sunday but Macron\u2019s gamble didn\u2019t exactly pay off. A left-wing New Popular Front coalition emerged to foil Le Pen and the elections ended up empowering the far-left, which Macron had previously crushed with his new brand of centrist politics. An era of political turmoil now looms with a hung parliament, a likely shaky coalition and instability ahead of the next presidential election in 2027. Britain Voters last week ended the 14-year-rule of the Conservative Party marked by scandals, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and political chaos that included five different prime ministers in eight years. The new Prime Minister Keir Starmer led his Labour Party to a landmark victory but faces a tough task in mending decaying public services with government finances depleted and with the economy hampered by the impact of Brexit. Indonesia Prabowo Subianto, a former army general, won the presidential election in the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation,\u00a0which is home to its largest Muslim population. Subianto is ostensibly a supporter of Indonesia\u2019s vibrant but often fragile democracy where the military still looms as a key power player. But he has been shadowed by accusations of human rights abuses, especially during his military career during the rule of his father-in-law and dictator Suharto. India The world\u2019s largest democracy sprung a surprise that showed the power of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d even in a nation where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of squelching the freedom of assembly and the press and eroding secular guarantees in the constitution. The Hindu nationalist leader did stay in power,\u00a0but his hopes of capturing an unassailable parliamentary majority crashed. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party will now have to rely on coalition partners following a weeklong election that will be remembered for a prominent pollster bursting into tears on live television after botching an exit poll\u00a0that\u00a0missed the shock result. Pakistan The power of voters and the limits of democracy were,\u00a0meanwhile,\u00a0on show in neighboring Pakistan in February in a massive protest vote against the military that left allies of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan with the largest bloc in parliament. But two anti-Khan parties \u2014 the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan People\u2019s Party \u2013 united to keep the former cricket superstar\u2019s affiliates from forming a government. Asif Ali Zardari, the scandal-tainted husband of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,\u00a0is now serving as president with an ally as prime minister. Bangladesh Concerns about the erosion of democracy in South Asia were also intensified by the victory of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in January in an election that the United States warned was not free and fair and that was marred by the arrests of thousands of members of the opposition. Russia There were no surprises in Russia, where President Vladimir\u00a0Putin stage-managed voting to extend his one-man rule until at least 2030. The election was the first since the death of opposition figure Alexey Navalny in a prison colony. And\u00a0those allowed to stand in opposition to Putin were controlled by the Kremlin with credible opposition figures all jailed, exiled or prohibited from running. El Salvador Strongman rule was also enshrined in El Salvador \u2014 through democratic means. President Nayib Bukele,\u00a0the self-proclaimed world\u2019s \u201ccoolest dictator\u201d whose wild popularity as president is based on his purge against gangs, was overwhelmingly reelected. His dominance was boosted when his New Ideas party won a thumping congressional majority. Despite his popularity, critics warn that Bukele is seriously eroding democratic standards in his country. Mexico Similar concerns about democratic institutions are being raised in Mexico after the historic election of the country\u2019s first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum. The left-wing climate scientist\u00a0and physicist profited from the popularity of her longtime ally, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Sheinbaum, who will also be Mexico\u2019s first Jewish president when she is sworn in, has the legislative majority to push through constitutional reforms that critics say will gut independent regulatory agencies, could politicize the judiciary and lead to few checks on executive presidential power. Taiwan The dynamism of democracy in Taiwan was showcased in an election that immediately intensified tensions with China. Lai Ching-te, the previous vice president, secured a historic third consecutive presidential election victory for his Democratic Progressive Party as voters shrugged off warnings by Beijing that their choice could increase the chances\u00a0of\u00a0conflict with a mainland government that insists Taiwan is part of China. South Korea In South Korea in April, voters delivered a stirring demand for change by handing liberal opposition parties a majority in the legislature in a blow to President\u00a0Yoon\u00a0Suk Yeol and his conservatives. The election was shaped by public anger over a cost-of-living crisis and political scandals, including one swirling around the president\u2019s wife. Portugal Incumbents suffered another blow in Portugal in March when the socialist government was ousted by the center-right Democratic Alliance coalition. But the election was most notable for the rise of the radical right-wing party Chega, which\u00a0took nearly a fifth of the vote for its leader Andr\u00e9 Ventura, a former trainee priest and football pundit. Many observers expect a new election soon because of the vulnerability of the minority government. Slovakia There was good news for Putin in Slovakia in April.\u00a0Left-wing nationalist Peter Pellegrini won a presidential election in a boost to pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has sparked concerns over the rule of law and government interference in the media. The result, however, was soon overshadowed by an assassination attempt against Fico, who suffered serious injuries and suggested he was targeted because he broke with the dominant pro-Ukraine position in Europe. South Africa Voters in South Africa also demanded change as the ruling African National Congress \u2014 the party of Nelson Mandela \u2014 lost its majority for the first time in 30 years in the most significant political shift since the ending of apartheid. The rebuke followed years of corruption scandals, economic mismanagement and rising violent crime. The political horse trading following the election produced an alliance that was even more stunning than the result.\u00a0The\u00a0ANC formed an agreement to form a government with its staunchest adversary \u2014 the White-led Democratic Alliance,\u00a0which had been the official opposition to the ANC for years. Senegal Senegal has long been seen as one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies, but that legacy seemed in doubt following a decision by outgoing President Macky Sall to delay the election, which triggered mass protests. Sall was,\u00a0however,\u00a0overruled by the country\u2019s top court and the presidential election went ahead in March with opposition candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye winning a majority and becoming, at age 44, the youngest democratically elected president in Africa days after he was released from prison in an amnesty granted by Sall. Iran Iran wasn\u2019t supposed to have a presidential election this year. But the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash forced snap polls that exacerbated a succession drama surrounding the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei amid public frustration over economic conditions and clerical authoritarianism. Tehran\u2019s religious leaders kept a lid on dissent and approved a slate of mostly hardline candidates. But reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian beat ultraconservative Saeed Jalili,\u00a0amid the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Pezeshkian has favored\u00a0dialogue with Iran\u2019s foes, particularly over its nuclear program, but the US said it did not expect Iran\u2019s posture to the outside world to change since the Ayatollah wields ultimate power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/global-elections-roundup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_russian-bot-farm-propaganda-justice-department", "text": "The US Justice Department said Tuesday\u00a0that it\u00a0seized two internet domains and searched nearly 1,000 social media accounts that Russian operatives allegedly used to pose as US residents to spread disinformation in the US and abroad. The so-called bot farm used artificial intelligence to create fake social media profiles purporting to be people in the US and used those phony accounts to post support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, according to the Justice Department. The elaborate scheme was organized by an employee of RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, financed by the Kremlin, and aided an officer of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence, the Justice Department alleged. The news comes as US intelligence officials are on heightened alert for efforts by Russia or other foreign powers to meddle in the 2024 election. US\u00a0officials are watching closely to see whether\u00a0the\u00a0United States\u2019 support for Ukraine\u00a0will lead the Russian government\u00a0to take more risks\u00a0in potentially interfering in the 2024 presidential election,\u00a0FBI officials\u00a0previously\u00a0said. European countries have also been on high alert for a flood of Russian influence operations as the Kremlin tries to splinter support for Ukraine\u2019s defense. Russian propagandists have\u00a0ramped up\u00a0efforts to denigrate the Paris Olympics this month, including through a fake documentary that uses AI to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise, according to Microsoft. Asked for comment, an RT spokesperson did not respond to the substance of the Justice Department allegations, and instead emailed: \u201cFarming is a beloved pastime for millions of Russians.\u201d CNN has requested comment on the Justice Department announcement from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, the Kremlin and the FSB. X voluntarily suspended the bot accounts identified in court documents, the Justice Department said.\u00a0CNN has requested comment from X. It wasn\u2019t just the FBI that helped expose the alleged bot farm. US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit, was involved, as were Dutch and Canadian security agencies. The bot farm also targeted Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine and Israel, according to an\u00a0advisory\u00a0released Tuesday by US, Dutch and Canadian authorities. Long a mouthpiece for the Russian government, RT has seen some of its influence in the US wane in recent years as social media platforms have\u00a0taken steps to block access to its output. But the outlet has looked for new ways to reach audiences, including, the Justice Department alleges, through an army of fake X accounts. According to an affidavit from an FBI agent, RT leadership signed off on a proposal from an employee to use software to create a bot farm that \u201cin theory\u201d would \u201ccreate multiple social media accounts through which RT \u2026 could distribute information on a wide-scale basis.\u201d The scheme kicked into gear when Russian operatives bought one of two domain names in 2022 from an Arizona-based company, Namecheap, that were used to set up the bot farm, according to court documents. The RT employee, an FSB officer and others had access to the bot farm, which included X accounts that purported to be interested in cryptocurrency, according to the Justice Department. In one case, a fake account purporting to be based in Minneapolis posted a video of Russian President Vladimir Putin claiming that parts of Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania were a \u201cgift\u201d from Russian forces that freed them from Nazi control during World War II, the Justice Department said. In another case, a fake account replied to an unnamed US politician running for federal office with a video of Putin trying to justify Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the department said. The Justice Department \u201cwill not tolerate Russian government actors and their agents deploying AI to sow disinformation and fuel division among Americans,\u201d\u00a0Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/russian-bot-farm-propaganda-justice-department/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_michael-cohen-supreme-court-trump-alleged-retaliation", "text": "Michael Cohen, the one-time fixer for Donald Trump, is asking the Supreme Court to revive his lawsuit against the former president for allegedly retaliating against him for promoting his tell-all book critical of Trump, according to Cohen\u2019s attorney. Cohen sued Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr and other federal officials in 2021 for alleged retaliation in response to public comments he made about the book. After declining to sign an agreement barring him from speaking with the media, Cohen was taken back into custody and placed in solitary confinement for more than two weeks, court records show. A US District Court dismissed Cohen\u2019s lawsuit for damages, and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0upheld that decision in January. \u201cWhen Cohen, who was writing a book critical of Trump, did not agree immediately to waive his right to free speech, he was summarily sent back to prison and thrown into solitary confinement,\u201d Cohen told the Supreme Court in an appeal his lawyer said he filed Wednesday. \u201cAs it stands, this case represents the principle that presidents and their subordinates can lock away critics of the executive without consequence.\u201d For the claim to survive, Cohen will have to clear a tall hurdle the Supreme Court has erected that makes it difficult for Americans to sue federal law enforcement officials. A\u00a01971 Supreme Court decision,\u00a0Bivens\u00a0v. Six Unknown Named Agents, established that people could sue federal agents if their rights were violated. But the court has been unwilling to expand that right beyond a limited number of circumstances. Two years ago, the high court denied a \u201cBivens\u201d claim against a Border Patrol agent in Washington state and further limited the conditions under which such lawsuits can be filed. That litigation followed an\u00a0encounter in which the owner of an inn near the US-Canada border claimed the agent used excessive force and then retaliated against him for reporting the incident. The Supreme Court will likely decide in the fall whether or not to hear arguments in Cohen\u2019s appeal. A Trump campaign spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine counts, including for campaign finance violations tied to payments he made or orchestrated to women during the 2016 campaign, and\u00a0was serving a three-year prison sentence.\u00a0He was released from prison on furlough in 2020 during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. When Cohen met with probation officials later that year,\u00a0they presented Cohen with\u00a0an agreement that required him to avoid engaging with the media and using social media. After Cohen sought to change the terms of that agreement, he was transported back to prison and placed in solitary confinement for 16 days, according to court records. At the appeals court, Trump\u2019s attorneys described Cohen\u2019s claims as \u201cmeritless\u201d and said he failed to establish any connection between the former president and the agreement. A federal court ordered Cohen\u2019s release days later.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/michael-cohen-supreme-court-trump-alleged-retaliation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_biden-democratic-lawmakers-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday clung onto the Democratic nomination on a high-stakes day in Washington, but the risks of his refusal to step aside were laid bare when one of his party\u2019s senators warned on CNN that Donald Trump could win in a \u201clandslide.\u201d Biden\u2019s stubbornness leaves Democrats increasingly fearful that the president could put at risk not just the White House but any chance of retaking the House or holding the Senate \u2014 already an uphill battle. The White House did succeed in heading off rebellions in emotional meetings of Senate and House Democrats on Tuesday but even some members who back Biden expressed reservations about his tactics and capacity to run a winning campaign. And on Wednesday, uncertainty about the president\u2019s prospects grew with comments from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and as actor and Democratic donor George Clooney called on Biden to voluntarily step aside. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet was among three Democrats who privately voiced fears that Biden couldn\u2019t win in November, sources told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, and then became the first of his colleagues to go public. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I said that,\u201d Bennet told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\u201d He added: \u201cSo for me, this isn\u2019t a question about polling. It\u2019s not a question about politics. It\u2019s a moral question about the future of our country.\u201d \u201cThe White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\u201d Bennet\u2019s remarks do not represent the public position of all Democratic senators but there is no doubt the debate and its aftermath have created deep concern in the party. Pelosi referred to that anxiety among members when she appeared to suggest that, despite Biden\u2019s insistence he\u2019s going nowhere, the issue of his spot on the Democratic ticket was still uncertain.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We\u2019re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\u201d she said on MSNBC Wednesday morning. \u201cI want him to do whatever he decides to do and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d And in a remarkable op-ed in The New York Times, Clooney turned on the president after appearing alongside him at a fundraiser last month. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\u201d\u00a0Clooney\u00a0wrote.\u00a0\u201cWe are not going to win in November with this president,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view. The last two weeks have badly weakened Biden\u2019s standing in a party already unenthusiastic about his campaign. His terrible stretch threatens to further narrow an already tenuous path to reelection against an invigorated\u00a0Trump, who burst back onto the campaign trail Tuesday night with a blistering rally in Florida, nine days before he accepts the Republican nomination. Deep disquiet over the president\u2019s prospects hung over shaken Democratic senators and representatives in Washington Tuesday, as venting sessions took place behind closed doors at both ends of the US Capitol. But no critical mass of lawmakers emerged to seriously threaten Biden\u2019s hold on the nomination and the party\u2019s Senate and House leaders offered clear, if hardly effusive, support for the president. Ultimately, Biden\u2019s warning in a letter to lawmakers on Monday \u2014 \u201cI am firmly committed to staying in this race\u201d \u2014 and the knowledge that primary voters have spoken left his critics little leeway to act. Pelosi on Wednesday morning again implied that the question of the Democratic ticket was not closed. She advised Democrats, \u201cjust hold off, whatever you\u2019re thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don\u2019t have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\u201d After Pelosi\u2019s comments went viral, a spokesperson said in a statement that the former speaker \u201cfully supports whatever President Biden decides to do.\u201d Another Democrat, Rep. Ritchie Torres,\u00a0offered a stark warning\u00a0to CNN\u00a0about the potential\u00a0down-ballot\u00a0effect\u00a0of Biden\u2019s reelection bid Wednesday: \u201cIf we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d \u201cThere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d Torres also said in a statement. Biden will face a fresh test on Thursday when he holds a solo press conference at the end of the NATO summit. Any slip-ups or confusion would rip off the fragile patch Biden has fixed on the dam of Democratic Party support. The spectacle of a party debating the viability, strength and mental capacity of its nominee less than four months from Election Day encapsulates the crisis that has consumed the president\u2019s campaign. There is little evidence so far that Biden is ready to throw himself into saturation-level town halls, campaign swings and media blitzes that many Democrats \u2014 including those who think he should stay in the race \u2014 have called on him to do. Some Democrats now see him as unlikely to win in November. And for all of them, the vibe is existential because Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, has rarely been in a stronger political position since jumping into presidential politics. Biden survives a critical day Tuesday had been seen as a critical day for Biden because it was the first time lawmakers gathered en masse since the debate late last month and the July Fourth recess that followed. But even as the number of lawmakers calling for him to step aside ticked up, the president so far this week has managed to stabilize the post-debate crisis. \u201cWe do want to turn the page. We want to get to the other side of this,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters, although Biden\u2019s parlous political fortunes as the oldest-ever president mean this may be an impossible aspiration. Still, Biden delivered one of his strongest recent public appearances in welcoming world leaders to the NATO summit in Washington Tuesday, even if the effect of aging was obvious in his diction and movements. \u201cRemember, the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen,\u201d he said, while lauding the \u201csingle greatest, most effective defense alliance in the history of the world.\u201d The boldness of Biden\u2019s rhetoric was a reminder that the summit should have been all about showcasing his leadership as one of the most significant leaders of the West since World War II and setting up a contrast with Trump, who spent his first term berating America\u2019s European allies. Instead, the event has turned into a test of the president\u2019s acuity. White House officials told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche that Tuesday\u2019s speech went off as planned and that staff hoped that Biden could now go back to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d That\u2019s unlikely to happen because every public event by the president has turned into an excruciating vigil with everyone braced for gaffes, awkward moments or freezes. And his every on-camera appearance is refracted through the prism of a debate performance that seared an unflattering picture of a struggling Biden on the minds of 50 million viewers. It\u2019s a low bar for a president to get through a short, scripted speech on a teleprompter at a summit without having a catastrophe. And Biden\u2019s often glacial pace in big public moments creates poignant contrasts with the wise-cracking force of nature that he used to be. The equation is unlikely to change over the next four months because it\u2019s endemic to this matchup and the president\u2019s decision to run for a new term that would end when he is 86. Biden needs one of his classic comebacks more than ever Still, it\u2019s too early to count Biden out. Voters decide elections, not critical lawmakers or scathing media commentary. The president has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise and has found inner steel in a life scarred by personal tragedy and political disappointments. And Trump, the first former president to be a convicted criminal, has an uncanny capacity to alienate moderate, suburban, and swing voters with his extreme rhetoric and threats against his opponents. The ex-president will be back center stage next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is likely to turn into a MAGA festival that the Biden camp sees as a chance to reinforce the contrast with Trump that the president\u2019s debate nightmare obliterated for the last two weeks. Most post-debate national polls suggest Biden lost at least a couple of points to Trump in what had been a race inside the margin of error. There is little high-quality polling in swing states so far that spans the debate aftermath. But Biden was generally seen as trailing Trump in many of the battlegrounds that will decide the election before the debate, which he needed to use to reset his clash with Trump. Instead, he created reverse momentum that he\u2019s still not arrested. And it\u2019s not just a question of the horse race. Biden was unable to use his debate answers to frame a sharp contrast with Trump on the most important issues to Democrats, including abortion, taxes, character, and the ex-president\u2019s perceived threat to democracy and founding US values. This \u2013 along with Biden\u2019s somewhat delusional disbelief in his own mid-30s approval rating and the apparent state of the race \u2013 fueled Democratic despair. That sense of disappointment with Biden was on display as lawmakers filed into their meetings on Tuesday, with many declining to speak to reporters on the way out. A source familiar with the Democratic Senate lunch told CNN\u2019s Bash that as well as Bennet, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana told colleagues they don\u2019t think Biden can beat Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I said that,\u201d Bennet told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins later Tuesday. \u201cDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\u201d Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said senators believe Biden must take on unscripted situations to answer questions from voters. King, asked what would happen if Biden stumbled in such settings, replied: \u201cIt seems to me that\u2019s a risk they have to take. If he\u2019s OK, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d One of Biden\u2019s most fervent supporters, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, defended the president. \u201cWe concluded that Joe Biden is old; we found out, and the polling came back that he\u2019s old,\u201d Fetterman told CNN. \u201cBut we also agreed that he\u2019s our guy.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is rarely reluctant to speak at length, was asked several times about Biden but only replied, \u201cI\u2019m with Joe,\u201d in an apparent attempt to shut down the line of questioning. Biden got a boost when New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who had privately expressed doubts about the president\u2019s spot on the ticket, said he\u2019d now support him. But the New York Democrat hinted that his decision had as much to do with the difficultly of pushing the presumptive party nominee aside as a feeling that he was a strong bet. \u201cI\u2019m not resigned to it. He made very clear he\u2019s going to run. He\u2019s got an excellent record, one of the most excellent presidents of the last century. Trump would be an absolute disaster for democracy; so, I\u2019m enthusiastically supporting Biden,\u201d Nadler said. The president has also been bolstered by the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, a vital power player in the House Democratic Caucus. Many of the CBC\u2019s members are in solid blue districts and may be under less pressure than frontline Democrats who have criticized the president\u2019s debate performance. Texas Rep. Marc Veasey expressed concern for those vulnerable colleagues when criticizing Biden\u2019s attempt to bounce back from the debate. \u201cWhatever I have seen so far hasn\u2019t shown me that that\u2019s going to be enough to get there. I just don\u2019t think that dog is gonna hunt,\u201d Veasey told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cI think that he has a long way to go and I think there are stronger candidates that would be more likely to beat Trump at this point, but if he says that he is going to stay in, (then) he\u2019s the nominee,\u201d Veasey said. Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey lavished praise on Biden\u2019s presidency and his victory over Trump in 2020 but became the seventh House Democrat to call on him to stand aside on Tuesday. \u201cBecause I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won\u2019t run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\u201d Some Democratic leaders sought to jump their members out of their angst by launching an attack against Trump. \u201cEvery single member of the House Democratic Caucus is clear eyed about what the stakes of this election are,\u201d said Rep. Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the caucus. \u201cDonald Trump cannot be allowed near the Oval Office and his extremist allies must never be allowed to pass a national abortion ban or their dangerous Project 2025, which would erode our democracy and enable Trump\u2019s worst impulses,\u201d the California Democrat said. But the strength of his presentation in a press conference only served to highlight the lines of attack that Biden largely missed in the debate. There was a brighter mood around the Democratic ticket in Las Vegas, where Vice President Kamala Harris displayed the forensic rhetoric of a former prosecutor to attack Trump. \u201cI will say that someone who vilifies immigrants, who promotes xenophobia, someone who stokes hate should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone and the seal of the President of the United States,\u201d Harris said. For those Democrats who think Harris would make a better nominee than the president, her fiery delivery was a reminder of an alternative 2024 path that Biden has acted to close off.

{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_house-gop-noncitizen-voting-bill", "text": "House Republicans passed a bill on Wednesday that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections, despite the fact that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections \u2013 a move that comes as former President Donald Trump and his allies continue to sow doubts over election integrity in the run-up to the 2024 elections. House Speaker Mike Johnson has been outspoken in support of the legislation and Trump has called for its passage. But critics say the push to require documents proving citizenship to vote could wrongfully disenfranchise citizens if they lack access to the types of documents that meet the requirement. It\u2019s illegal for people who aren\u2019t US citizens to vote in federal contests, and experts say it rarely happens, given that violators face imprisonment and deportation.\u00a0Opponents\u00a0also warn the GOP focus on noncitizen voting could serve as a way to undermine the results of the 2024 presidential election if Republicans do not win the White House. The bill is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Biden administration has said that it \u201cstrongly opposes\u201d the measure. In addition to requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration in federal elections, the bill also includes provisions for removing noncitizens from federal voter registration rolls. The vote is part of a broader push by Trump allies and comes after Trump and Johnson\u00a0raised concerns about the integrity of US elections\u00a0in a joint appearance at Mar-a-Lago in April that featured false claims about voting and immigration. At that event,\u00a0Johnson raised baseless concerns about \u201cpotentially hundreds of thousands of votes\u201d being cast by undocumented immigrants in the November presidential election. On Wednesday, Johnson said in a House floor speech ahead of the vote,\u00a0\u201cWould we prefer to wait for fraud to happen and only do something after elections are finalized? No, we have to catch the fraud on the front end so there\u2019s no question about the integrity of our votes.\u201d \u201cThere should be no objection to this legislation at all,\u201d he said. Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that Republicans must pass the bill, writing, \u201cOur whole voting system is under siege.\u201d The Biden administration has denounced the bill, saying in a statement earlier this week, \u201cThe alleged justification for this bill is based on easily disproven falsehoods. \u2026 States already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters\u2019 eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls. This bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.\u201d CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/house-gop-noncitizen-voting-bill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_harris", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday delivered the keynote speech at Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\u2019s biennial convention, issuing a call to action for Black women voters as she seeks to mobilize the key demographic amid a crucial week for the Biden-Harris reelection campaign. \u201cI do believe this is the most existential, consequential and important election of our lifetimes, sorors. Sorors, this is a serious matter,\u201d Harris said to thousands of her sorority sisters at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas. \u201cAnd so, in this moment, once again, our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward, to energize, organize and mobilize, to register folks to vote and to get them to the polls in November, because we know when we organize, mountains move. When we mobilize, nations change, and when we vote, we make history,\u201d she added. The ties between Harris and AKA, the oldest historically Black sorority in the country, run deep. Harris was a member of the sorority during her time at Howard University, and her sorority sisters have been among some of her most ardent and vocal supporters throughout her political career, especially when she was campaigning for president four years ago before Biden chose her to run alongside him when he clinched the nomination. Black women have been credited with helping propel Biden to the presidency in 2020, and they have been the most consistently supportive bloc for Biden since his time as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. But the timing of this year\u2019s address at AKA\u2019s 71st Boule is especially crucial, as Biden has seen lagging support due to his handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, persistent concerns about the 81-year-old president\u2019s age and mental acuity and continued worries about the shape of the economy. Harris\u2019 appearance comes as she\u2019s traveling to several states this week, including Nevada and North Carolina, following Biden\u2019s poor debate performance and hoping to rally key constituencies including Black, female and young voters. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\u2019s Boule is held every two years and invites members from around the world to convene for certification training, forums, workshops, community service projects and other events. In a post on Instagram, the sorority said Harris would be addressing more than 20,000 members in Dallas for her keynote speech. The post cited one of the sorority\u2019s key program initiatives, which is \u201cAdvocating for Social Justice.\u201d That initiative encompasses voter education, voter registration, mobilization and candidate forums. \u201cThe keynote address by Harris allows us to continue the efforts of our international program initiative \u2018Advocate for Social Justice,\u2019\u201d the sorority wrote. \u201cAlpha Kappa Alpha stands in the gap to empower and equip communities with knowledge, support, and tools through advocacy and social justice.\u201d Harris said AKA is \u201ca big part of me\u201d and underlined the role Black women played in Biden\u2019s victory to the White House in the last election. \u201cThe leaders of Alpha Kappa Alpha have stood up, spoken out, and done the work to build a brighter future for our nation, including, of course, in 2020, when,\u00a0during the height of a pandemic, you helped elect Joe Biden\u00a0president of the United States, and me as the first woman elected\u00a0vice\u00a0president of the United States,\u201d she said. Some sorority members attending Boule said Tuesday they were eager to hear the vice president speak. Glenda Baskin Glover, the former international president and CEO of AKA, said she hopes Harris discusses the Biden administration\u2019s record on supporting abortion rights, HBCU funding and student loan forgiveness. Glover, who is the former president of Tennessee State University and sits on Biden\u2019s HBCU Advisory Board, said Harris\u2019 speech will be critical to mobilizing sorority members to vote. \u201cEducational rights are on the ballot and a woman\u2019s right to choose what she does with her own body, that is definitely on the ballot,\u201d Glover said. \u201cShe can tell us what the Biden administration has done over the last three and half years to uplift women and minorities.\u201d Janae Dandridge, an AKA member from Detroit, said she believes Harris and the Biden administration understand the voting power of the sorority. Dandridge said Harris will need to speak about unifying the country in this divisive political climate, reproductive rights and the importance of fighting for social justice if she wants to build confidence in the Biden campaign. \u201cI think at the end of the day, our organization is so large \u2026 and it\u2019s such a powerful body of women located all over the country and the world who can get out and vote,\u201d Dandridge said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just us, we have family members and friends who can be force multipliers in getting other people out to vote. We can make a difference for the election.\u201d AKA is an international organization made up of more than 360,000 graduate and undergraduate members. It is the\u00a0oldest Greek-letter organization created by Black\u00a0college-educated women. AKA was founded in 1908 at Howard University. Glynda Carr \u2013 a member of AKA and president of Higher Heights for America, a political organization that engages Black women in politics \u2013 said Black women should not be taken for granted in this race. \u201cWhen a Black woman is fired up about ensuring that her community, you know, has access to resources and that we\u2019re centering the issues that we care about \u2013 she actually doesn\u2019t go to the polls alone. I always say she brings her house to her block, her church, her sorority and her union,\u201d Carr told CNN. She added that Harris\u00a0\u201cneeds to be fueled up with the energy\u00a0\u2026\u00a0to continue to go out to fight the good fight on the issues that we care\u00a0about.\u00a0(It\u2019s important that) the young undergrads here see the possibilities that exist for their leadership, right?\u00a0You can\u2019t be who you can\u2019t see.\u201d The speech comes at a critical time for the vice president. While Harris has been floated as a likely candidate for nomination if Biden decides to step aside ahead of November (he has repeatedly said he would not), she has remained firmly behind the president ever since the minutes after his disastrous debate last month. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I\u2019ve been watching the last three-and-a-half years of performance,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper immediately after the debate. Harris has spoken with elected officials over the last week expressing her support for the Biden-Harris ticket and calling for the party to stay united, according to a Harris aide. On Wednesday, the vice president touted the administration\u2019s record on several policy issues including health care and the economy, and also announced the Biden administration\u2019s creation of national health and safety standards for maternal care during her remarks. \u201cFor the first time, we have created national health and safety standards for maternal care. For the first time, national standards, which means nearly every hospital in our country will soon be required to provide new mothers with delivery rooms that are fully stocked with life-saving medical equipment,\u201d Harris said. But despite the administration\u2019s efforts, Harris emphasized \u201cwe have more work do,\u201d specifically around gun violence prevention, voting rights and women\u2019s reproductive freedom. Harris\u2019 team has kept their heads down amid the party fallout, following a mandate from senior officials to stay the course.\u00a0But that hasn\u2019t kept some Democrats from floating her name to lead the party\u2019s ticket. On Sunday, during a call held by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries with House Democratic ranking members,\u00a0it was generally acknowledged the nominee should be Harris, CNN previously reported. Over the weekend, Harris made no mention of the growing concerns over Biden\u2019s candidacy\u00a0during a moderated conversation with President & CEO of Essence Ventures Caroline Wanga, instead outlining the stakes of the upcoming election and a second Trump term. She echoed that on Wednesday. She again argued if elected, Trump would push for a national abortion ban should get reelected in November. \u201cWe will not let him. We will not let that happen. We have worked too hard and fought too long to see our daughters throw up in a world with fewer rights than our mothers. America must trust women. America must honor individual choice. America must defend freedom,\u201d she said. Harris denounced Project 2025, a conservative group\u2019s plans to radically reshape the federal government and American life should Trump win a second term. \u201cTrump advisors have created a 900-page blueprint of their agenda for the second term,\u201d Harris said as the crowd notably joined her in sync calling out the name: \u201cProject 2025.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt includes a plan to cut Social Security, to repeal our $35 cap on insulin, to eliminate the Department of Education and end programs like Head Start. So, let us be clear, this represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_politics_house-democrats-biden-future", "text": "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday that \u201cThere must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\u201d a marked reversal from his approach just days ago. On Monday, Torres\u00a0said\u00a0that the intra-party controversy was \u201cself-destructive\u201d worrying that it could weaken Biden\u2019s candidacy, should he remain the nominee. Now Torres has gone public in becoming much more explicit about Biden\u2019s candidacy, saying to CNN: \u201cIf we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\u201d This remark comes after a call between Biden and members of the CBC\u00a0Monday evening\u00a0that attempted to solidify the president\u2019s support among this key bloc of Democrats. Many prominent members of the CBC have staunchly supported Biden as questions swirl around his candidacy. Torres, who represents much of the Bronx, seems not to be sold on Biden remaining at the top of the ticket, instead focusing on polling as an indicator for viability. \u201cWhat matters is not how we feel but what the numbers tell us,\u201d he said. \u201cAn unsentimental analysis of the cold hard numbers \u2014 which have no personal feelings or political loyalties \u2014 should inform what we decide and whom we nominate.\u201d Despite the Biden campaign\u2019s effort to reassure congressional allies this week, reaction from Democrats on Capitol Hill showcased the headwinds facing the president. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made headlines when she told MSNBC on Wednesday that it\u2019s up to Biden \u201cto decide if he is going to run\u201d \u2013 despite Biden\u2019s repeated public comments this week that he\u2019s not leaving the race \u2013 the second time in as many weeks Pelosi has signaled the effort to replace Biden is not over. Pelosi\u2019s office later issued in a new statement that \u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u00a0fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do.\u201d Torres wasn\u2019t the only Democrat from New York to express skepticism of Biden\u2019s chances this fall\u00a0and the potential harmful impact he could have on down-ballot races. Moderate Rep. Pat Ryan announced Wednesday that he was the eighth House Democrat to call on Biden to step aside in the presidential race. \u201cFor the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside \u2013 to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders,\u201d Ryan wrote on X. On Tuesday, Torres\u00a0posted on X\u00a0about the Cook Political Report reclassifying six states away from Biden and toward former President Donald Trump with the caption \u201calarming and sobering.\u201d CPR\u2019s classifications now align more closely with\u00a0CNN\u2019s own Race Ratings, which already had many of the states CPR reclassified as leaning toward Republicans. Torres sits in a safely Democratic seat, having won election with 82% of the vote in 2022. Biden also won the area handily in 2020.
