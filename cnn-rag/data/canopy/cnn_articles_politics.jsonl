{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters", "text": "The way American campaigns are financed can be impenetrable even to people who pay close attention to politics. Campaigns can only get so much money directly from donors. More money flows to organizations that can\u2019t technically coordinate with campaigns but sure seem to come close. Separate organizations can also try to influence elections by pushing for issues, but they sure seem to try to benefit candidates. Add into that complicated mess the fact that former President Donald Trump has been paying his copious legal bills through the campaign finance system. To better understand what we know about how and by whom campaigns are being funded in 2024, I went to Fredreka Schouten, who covers this complicated issue for CNN. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below. WOLF: What are the broad strokes of what we know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: During the course of this campaign, the former president has asked his political donors to help pay his soaring legal bills. The primary vehicle has been a leadership PAC called Save America that Trump established after he lost the White House in November 2020. Trump seeded the PAC largely with money he raised in the aftermath of his loss when he asked for donors\u2019 help in fighting what he claimed was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. (Save America also transferred some of that money \u2013 $60 million \u2013 to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., that could directly spend money to help his campaign. More on that later.) As a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, Trump has consistently diverted a share of new political donations to Save America, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 to his legal expenses. For instance, a joint fundraising agreement among Trump, the Republican National Committee and a couple dozen state GOP committees\u00a0sends donations to Save America\u00a0before the national party and state committees get their cut, underscoring how much Trump prioritizes paying lawyers. Since the start of 2021, Save America has paid\u00a0nearly $80 million in legal bills\u00a0for Trump and others in his orbit. In April 2024 alone, as Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York got under way, the PAC racked up about $4.4 million in legal expenses between bills paid and outstanding debts, recent filings how. A big recipient: The law firm of Todd Blanche, the lead attorney representing Trump as he battled criminal charges in a Manhattan courtroom that centered on whether he falsified business records to conceal an election-eve payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump was convicted on May 30 and has vowed to appeal. WOLF: Can he simply use campaign dollars for court bills? Does the law allow that? SCHOUTEN: Federal campaign finance law is riddled with all sorts of loopholes. Technically, candidates cannot use money donated to their campaigns for personal expenses \u2013 whether that\u2019s to pay a criminal defense lawyer in a personal matter or to buy groceries. But the agency that enforces federal election law treats leadership PACs such as Save America differently than candidates\u2019 main campaign accounts. Leadership PACs started off as committees created by current and former members of Congress to help boost their profiles and support other candidates. They cannot be used to directly support a presidential campaign. But over the years, they really have become slush funds \u2013 helping underwrite travel, polling, meals and other expenses politicians incur. Keep in mind that Trump\u2019s allies maintain that applying donors\u2019 money to legal expenses is a legitimate use because they characterize all his legal troubles \u2013 whether in civil or criminal cases \u2013 as part of an extensive \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d organized by his enemies to derail his campaign. WOLF: How has the drain of his legal problems affected Trump\u2019s campaign war chest? SCHOUTEN: Well, the bills grew so high that Save America has clawed back tens of millions of dollars from the super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. So, as a practical matter, a super PAC focused on helping Trump get elected ended up diverting money to help pay legal bills during the early months of the presidential campaign. But one thing has become clear: Trump\u2019s team has used his legal difficulties as an engine to generate donations. We\u2019ve seen fundraising spikes during big court appearances but none so big as the nearly $53 million that Trump\u2019s political operation said it brought in in the 24 hours after the New York conviction last month. That single-day haul accounts for more than one-third of the whopping $141 million that the Trump campaign said it raised with the Republican National Committee in May. And MAGA Inc. just announced a May fundraising bonanza, saying it brought in nearly $70 million last month. WOLF: What are the important details we don\u2019t know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: We really don\u2019t have the full picture of legal expenses from campaign finance reports. Senior advisers have told CNN that Trump is paying some of his legal expenses out of pocket, for instance.\u00a0And we don\u2019t know how much the Trump Organization, his real estate and branding company, might be underwriting. During the New York criminal trial, for example, Rhona Graff, the president\u2019s former longtime assistant at the Trump Organization, testified that the company was paying her legal bills. WOLF: A complaint has been filed against Trump for hiding payments to lawyers. What\u2019s that about, and what could come of it? SCHOUTEN: The Campaign Legal Center\u00a0watchdog group filed the complaint with federal election regulators against Trump\u2019s campaign and related committees, alleging they have concealed details on millions of dollars in legal payments by routing the money through a vendor. The complaint centers on more than $7 million paid by Trump-aligned committees to Red Curve Solutions, LLC as \u201creimbursements\u201d for legal expenses \u2013 although the company is not a law firm and largely provides services to help campaigns comply with federal election reporting requirements. Bradley Crate, the treasurer of Trump\u2019s campaign, oversees Red Curve. In its complaint with the Federal Election Commission, the Campaign Legal Center said the payments suggest that Red Curve \u201croutinely advanced money or paid for the cost of legal services provided by other vendors\u201d and was later reimbursed, which would violate disclosure requirements of federal campaign finance law. Neither Crate nor the Trump campaign have responded to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the complaint. Don\u2019t expect action from the FEC anytime soon. The commission \u2013 evenly divided along partisan lines \u2013 often deadlocks on enforcement decisions or takes action years after a complaint is first lodged. WOLF: What is Joe Biden\u2019s team doing differently to test the campaign finance rules this year? SCHOUTEN: I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s doing anything differently, but he\u2019s relying on tactics we\u2019ve seen most politicians use in the big-money era \u2013 even if they have decried the rise of so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that keep their donors\u2019 identities private. The main super PAC supporting Biden\u2019s bid, Future Forward, gets a big chunk of its funding from a nonprofit arm that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors to the public. Our CNN Investigates colleague Casey Tolan earlier this year pored over tax records to report about a couple with ties to artificial intelligence investments and cryptocurrency trading emerging as some of the biggest donors to Future Forward\u2019s dark-money arm. WOLF: Is most of the election spending coming this year from campaigns, super PACs or issue organizations? SCHOUTEN: So far this year, outside groups \u2013 including super PACs and issue organizations \u2013 are leading the spending in advertising in the presidential race, according to a tally of AdImpact data by our CNN colleague David Wright, who keeps close tabs on political ads. That\u2019s not surprising. Candidates face strict limits on the size and source of donations they receive, but super PACs and other outside groups can raise unlimited sums from a wide array of sources. If you include future reservations, the pro-Biden super PAC currently leads presidential spending with some $130 million in ads reserved for the fall. But there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t be overtaken by Republican groups as the general election campaign heats up.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_blinken-middle-east-travel-ceasefire-deal", "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the Middle East next week as the United States seeks to ratchet up the pressure on a proposed ceasefire and hostage release deal that the administration argues could bring an end to the war in Gaza. Blinken will head to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Qatar to \u201cdiscuss with partners the need to reach a ceasefire agreement that secures the release of all hostages,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller announced Friday. The top US diplomat \u201cwill emphasize the importance of Hamas accepting the proposal on the table, which is nearly identical to one Hamas endorsed last month,\u201d Miller said. Hamas has not yet put forward a formal response to the proposal, which was transmitted to Hamas\u2019 political wing by the Qataris last Thursday. \u201cWe would hope for a response from Hamas as soon as possible, and we continue to wait,\u201d Miller said at a press briefing Thursday. A source familiar said Thursday that they expected a response in the coming days. In his meetings, Blinken \u201cwill discuss how the ceasefire proposal would benefit both Israelis and Palestinians\u201d and \u201cwill underscore that it would alleviate suffering in Gaza, enable a massive surge in humanitarian assistance, and allow Palestinians to return to their neighborhoods,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt would unlock the possibility of achieving calm along Israel\u2019s northern border \u2013 so both displaced Israeli and Lebanese families can return to their homes \u2013and set the conditions for further integration between Israel and its Arab neighbors, strengthening Israel\u2019s long-term security and improving stability across the region. The Secretary will also continue to reiterate the need to prevent the conflict from escalating further,\u201d he said. Blinken is the latest US official to travel to the region after President Joe Biden outlined the proposed deal last Friday, following visits by CIA Director Bill Burns and NSC official Brett McGurk. The top US diplomat has held a slew of calls to regional partners to discuss the proposal. As CNN reported Thursday, the Biden administration has spent the last week pushing countries, particularly Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, which have relations with Hamas to make specific threats to pressure the group to take the deal. The administration has asked multiple countries to threaten to freeze the bank accounts of Hamas members and clamp down on their ability to freely travel in the region, according to two US officials. In many cases, members of Hamas have long been able to operate freely despite being members of the terror group. The US has urged Qatar \u2013 who allows Hamas to operate a political office in its capital \u2013 to declare that it will kick out the terrorist group if they don\u2019t accept the deal, according to one of those US officials. After months of telling Hamas that they could risk getting kicked out, Qatar has now actually made that threat, that official said. Miller said on Wednesday that the US has seen both Egypt and Qatar \u201cexert significant pressure on Hamas,\u201d but he refused to get into the details of those separate pressure campaigns. In addition to meetings to push the deal, in Jordan, Blinken will attend \u201ca conference on the urgent humanitarian response to Gaza, co-hosted by Jordan, Egypt, and the United Nations,\u201d Miller said in his announcement Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/blinken-middle-east-travel-ceasefire-deal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_jill-biden-hunter-trial-first-lady-duties", "text": "First lady Jill Biden has traveled to great lengths to show support for her son Hunter as his federal gun trial is underway this week. The first lady was on hand at the Wilmington, Delaware, courthouse for the first three days of the felony trial this week, sitting through testimony recounting moments from one of the most troubled periods of her son\u2019s life. After departing court on Wednesday, she took a red-eye flight to France to attend the commemoration ceremonies for the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day. Less than 24 hours later, she boarded a military aircraft at Paris-Orly airport to make the journey home to Wilmington, where she\u2019s expected to attend court once again on Friday. Dr. Biden is set to travel back to Paris this weekend as she and her husband, President Joe Biden, will be feted with an official state visit. The back-and-forth travel and hours spent in the Delaware courtroom relistening to the details of a tumultuous saga\u00a0in\u00a0her family\u2019s history mark the latest example of how the first lady and president continue to keep their only living son close even as his legal entanglements play out against the backdrop of the presidential campaign. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d the president said in a statement Monday as the trial began. \u201cOur family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d The Bidens wanted to be close as the court proceedings began with the president spending most of Monday just a few miles away at his Wilmington home. For the first lady, there was no question she would be on hand at the courthouse to support her son throughout the trial \u2013 even as official duties called back in Washington, DC, and abroad. \u201cShe\u2019s his mother, and he\u2019s on trial, so of course she wants to be there as much as humanly possible,\u201d said Elizabeth Alexander, communications director for the first lady. \u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of parents, and maybe mothers especially feel, that when your children need you, it doesn\u2019t matter how old they get, they\u2019re always your children and you always want to be there to support them,\u201d she added. The first day of the trial coincided with the first lady\u2019s 73rd\u00a0birthday. On Tuesday, she hosted lawmakers for the annual White House congressional picnic after sitting in the court room earlier that day.\u00a0That same evening, she traveled back to Delaware to be in court on Wednesday morning and is expected to be a continual presence as the trial proceeds. \u201cThe back and forth, the push and pull, of family responsibilities, of first lady duties, of her career, of the campaign \u2013 that\u2019s just who she is,\u201d said Alexander. The White House has not announced the first lady\u2019s appearances in Delaware ahead of time. She could be in court when other family members are called to testify in the coming days.\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s defense team plans to call Naomi Biden, his daughter, and James Biden, his uncle and the president\u2019s brother, to testify as they begin to present their case Friday, according to people briefed on their plans. She\u2019s listened as prosecutors have laid out their case related to three felony charges stemming from a gun purchase her son made in 2018, and questioned witnesses. Dr. Biden was in France and not on hand when Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who later had a romantic relationship with Hunter Biden, took the witness stand. The first lady has sat stoically as her son\u2019s voice boomed through the courtroom when prosecutors played long audio excerpts of him detailing his addiction in his memoir, details she\u2019s likely heard before. During breaks from the court\u2019s proceedings, she\u2019s spent time with Hunter, the defense team and other Biden family members in a small room a few paces from the courtroom, with a phalanx of Secret Service agents guarding the door. The first lady huddled with her son\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell for several minutes during one of the breaks in the courtroom on Tuesday. The first lady stepped into the role of matriarch after marrying then-Senator Biden in 1977, five years after his first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident that also injured Beau and Hunter. \u201cJill came along at a really important point and put my family back together,\u201d the president said in an interview in 2021. \u201cShe\u2019s the glue that held it together.\u201d The Biden family was once again tested in 2015 when Beau Biden, whom many believed would one day run for the White House, died of brain cancer. The years that followed were tumultuous for the Biden family as Hunter Biden sank into the dark depths of addiction. In his memoir \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d he detailed how his mom and father tried to stage an intervention at their Wilmington home, a moment that descended into screaming and tears from the family. The first lady is known to be fiercely protective of her family, and she defended Hunter as he faced a federal criminal investigation in 2022. \u201cEverybody and their brother has investigated Hunter. They keep at it, and at it, and at it. I know that Hunter is innocent. I love my son, and I will keep looking forward,\u201d the first lady told NBC News. The first lady has slammed House Republicans investigating her son, saying that \u201cwhat they are doing to Hunter is cruel.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really proud of how Hunter has rebuilt his life after addiction,\u201d the first lady said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cI love my son and it\u2019s hurt, it\u2019s hurt my grandchildren, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m so concerned about \u2013 that it\u2019s affecting their lives as well.\u201d In an interview with ABC News on Thursday, the president said he would accept the jury\u2019s verdict in Hunter\u2019s case and ruled out the possibility of pardoning his son. As they wait for that decision to come, the first lady will be close by to lend her support at home and in court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/jill-biden-hunter-trial-first-lady-duties/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_republicans-justice-system-what-matters", "text": "Last week, President Joe Biden was defending the justice system as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of society. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Republicans tried to undercut the process that led to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York on state charges. This week, the president will have to remember those words while his son Hunter faces federal gun charges at a trial in Delaware, the first of two separate cases this year that could lead to jail time. The Biden family must be frustrated that a plea deal fell apart last year when it was rejected by the Trump-appointed judge in the case, Maryellen Noreika. Plus, these particular gun charges are rarely prosecuted on their own, perhaps evidence of the enhanced scrutiny placed on a president\u2019s son. Very different trials Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial is very different than Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, even if they both come in an election year, feature the public airing of painful, personal details and essentially boil down to allegations of lying on paperwork. Trump had to endure the detailed, public testimony of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleged an affair with Trump nearly 20 years ago. Hunter Biden will have to endure a public recounting of his affair with his brother Beau\u2019s widow, their tortured text messages and his drug addiction. But Trump\u2019s legal problems all revolve around his own campaigns and actions during and after his presidency. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments meant to cover up the alleged affair from voters in 2016. He also faces federal charges of mishandling classified information in Florida and trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, DC, as well as Georgia. Hunter Biden faces trial in Delaware starting this week for lying on a firearm background check application. He checked the box that said \u201cno\u201d he was not abusing or addicted to drugs. He also faces trial in California later this year for tax evasion. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed special counsel prosecuting the case, has never made allegations to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s tax problems to his father, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried, unsuccessfully, to connect the dots. I\u2019ve written before about how the Department of Justice ends up prosecuting similar numbers of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In New York this week, for instance, the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 his second distinct corruption trial in recent years \u2013 is underway. Trump may ultimately avoid federal prosecution. There is a very real possibility that Trump, while found guilty in a New York courtroom, will face neither set of the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith before Election Day in November. The US Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, and the judge in his classified documents case has delayed proceedings indefinitely. The Georgia case is also delayed, and an appeals court may not consider whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case until October. A chorus of bias allegations But while Joe Biden\u2019s son and the senior senator from New Jersey are both in major legal peril, it is quickly becoming an article of faith among Republicans that they are a targeted species by the justice system. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system,\u201d Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The justice system \u201chunts Republicans while\u00a0protecting Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, reacting to the Trump guilty verdict. In a fundraising pitch on X, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida encouraged supporters angry about the \u201ctravesty\u201d to \u201cget even.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took the conspiracy theorizing much further, arguing that the Department of Justice is only prosecuting Menendez and, separately, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas (who is also charged with bribery) because they have been critical of Biden on foreign relations and immigration policy \u2013 an allegation for which there is no evidence. Cotton predicted Biden would ultimately pardon his son. The White House has said there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden. Even Republicans who opposed Trump during the 2024 primary season are critical of Trump\u2019s New York conviction. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu complained that Trump will face sentencing days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThat is a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to do nothing but rile everybody up. It\u2019s going to look even more political than it is now, and just cast a shadow of a doubt on this entire case.\u201d \u2018I may feel differently about it\u2019 The irony here is that Trump in 2020 actually did pressure the Department of Justice to investigate Hunter Biden. He also pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to open an investigation, hoping to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company to his father. In 2016, Trump\u2019s supporters would launch into \u201clock her up\u201d chants targeting Hillary Clinton \u2013 behavior Trump encouraged at the time even though the FBI, in the form of then-director James Comey, announced before the election that there was not a strong enough case to prosecute Clinton over her private email server. Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that if elected again, he might feel differently about pushing for charges against Clinton. \u201cThey all said \u2018lock her up.\u2019 But I felt \u2013 and I could have done it \u2013 but I thought it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me. So I may feel differently about it,\u201d Trump said. Democrats promise to let the process play out against Hunter Biden Don\u2019t expect Democrats to show the same level of support for Hunter Biden that Republicans have shown for Trump. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised Democrats would respect the process as it plays out against the president\u2019s son. \u201cDemocrats are not out there saying that Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is a farce, it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s rigged. We\u2019re not attacking the justice system,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/republicans-justice-system-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_biden-d-day-american-leadership", "text": "The new world for which the greatest generation sacrificed in the bloody surf of the Normandy beaches is fading into history along with the last of the old soldiers. The 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings observed by President Joe Biden in France Thursday will likely be the last major decennial commemoration attended by significant numbers of veterans. Even a 19-year-old who stormed ashore in the biggest amphibious operation in history would soon be 100. \ufeff\u201cWe\u2019re not far off from the time when the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us, so we have a special obligation,\u201d Biden said after embracing and saluting the last surviving members of the invasion force, above the beaches where thousands of Americans died. \u201cWe cannot let what happened here be lost in the silence of the years to come.\u201d This year\u2019s memorial ceremony represents far more than a poignant farewell to surviving comrades of more than 150,000 allied troops who forged a beachhead for the liberation of Europe from Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazis. Presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from NATO nations gathered at a paradoxical moment. They are unusually united but experiencing growing dread. The alliance has a new sense of mission in opposing another war started by a tyrant bent on territorial expansion \u2014 this time in Ukraine. But at no point since June 6, 1944, has the unshakable US leadership of the West and support for internationalist values been so in question. Democracy is facing its sternest test in generations from far-right populism on the march on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Geopolitical empires like Russia and China are, meanwhile, resurgent and threatening to obliterate the global system dominated by Western values that has prevailed since World War II. Biden drew a direct line between the evil that US soldiers were called up to fight in the 1940s and the current attempt by President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia to wipe Ukraine off the map and extinguish its democracy. \u201cWe cannot let that happen.\u00a0To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable. Were we to do that, it means we\u2019d be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches. Make no mistake: We will not bow down, we will not forget,\u201d he said. Those who served in Normandy, Biden said, \u201call understood our democracy is only as strong as we make it all together. They knew, beyond any doubt, there are things that are worth fighting and dying for. Freedom is worth it, democracy is worth it, America\u2019s worth it, the world is worth it \u2013 then, now and always.\u201d His words were especially resonant amid growing fears in Europe that the United States \u2013 the bulwark of democracy ever since World War II \u2013 may be about to turn its back on the West. US allies already rattled by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s constant attacks on NATO in his first term were further rocked by his recent comment that he\u2019d let Russia do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d with allies that he regarded as failing to \u201cpay their bills\u201d on defense spending. The comment weakened the foundational NATO creed of mutual self-defense without which the alliance has no meaning. Some of Trump\u2019s ex-advisers have warned that he might try to exit the alliance if he wins a second term in November. Even if Biden wins, there are growing indications that Americans\u2019 willingness to maintain the security guarantees \u2014 even to former enemies like Germany and Japan that bought 80 years of peace \u2014 may be waning. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy has taken deep root in the Republican Party that once prided itself on winning the Cold War. The ex-president tried to overturn US democracy to stay in power four years ago. And some GOP figures led by the ex-president now appear to have more empathy for Putin than liberal European democracies that the United States rebuilt after World War II. And the monthslong delay in funding Biden\u2019s most recent aid package for Ukraine raised doubts that Washington will always stand up for democracy in Europe and against aggression by autocrats. Biden on Thursday cited an unrepayable debt owed to US, British, Canadian and other troops involved in Operation Overlord. He walked among row upon row of white crosses and Stars of David shaded by pine trees and oaks overlooking Omaha Beach. This is where more than 9,000 fallen Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia lay at rest thousands of miles from the land they left to save foreigners they\u2019d never met. When the final survivors of World War II are soon gone, the world will lose living testimony of a fight against tyranny that once involved millions of people and unimaginable pain and destruction. That will usher in a dangerous period when malevolent political actors will find it easier to distort history to bolster their own power. This has already been happening as the lessons of the Nazi Holocaust, from which there are dwindling numbers of survivors to bear witness, have been challenged by a rise in antisemitism in Western societies. Is America really \u2018back\u2019? Biden took great pleasure in traveling the world after winning the 2020 election and declaring \u201cAmerica is back.\u201d He lived up to his words by wielding the most effective leadership of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush at the end of the Cold War. But many foreign leaders worry that Biden\u2019s term is an interregnum of normality rather than a return to the certainty of US leadership. With his volatile temperament, transactional suspicion of alliances and idolizing of dictators, Trump\u2019s first term turned the United States from a bulwark of stability into an unpredictable force of disruption. After a long period of denial, many in the chancelleries of Europe expect Trump to be back. Trump\u2019s mix of isolationism and populism did not emerge in a vacuum. It was distilled from years of US military failures abroad in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and a growing belief among many Americans that the globalized world was eroding the domestic dividend of prosperity and security that flowed from World War II and was built by those who returned from the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific. A growing sense that Americans are tiring of their global role has sparked overdue debates in some European capitals about doing more to ensure the continent\u2019s own security. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believes that the internal threat to the West is as great as the external one posed by US enemies. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also what\u2019s happening to the political center in France, the political center in Germany, the likely gains of the far right in the upcoming EU elections. Even if Biden were to win, Americans, Europeans are asking difficult questions about American reliability.\u201d Success was not assured The Normandy landings, long regarded as a triumph, marked the moment in history when the United States truly emerged as a superpower with the might and the will to make the world safe for democracy. But at the time, the risk of sending an armada across the English Channel in questionable weather to battle hardened Nazi forces was enormous. As allied forces landed on the beaches, President Franklin Roosevelt uttered a D-Day prayer over the radio. \u201cAlmighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.\u201d To begin with, fears of failure seemed justified. By the end of June 6, none of the invading forces had achieved their first-day objectives. More than 10,000 were dead, wounded or missing. The Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, had prepared a message before the invasion in case of a retreat. \u201cIf any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone,\u201d he wrote. But the future president never had to take his remarks out of his wallet. In the days ahead, the allies slowly established a foothold in the northwest tip of the continent. After breaking out, they were in Paris by August and, after often bitter fighting, victory in Europe was won by May 1945. For many years after World War II, D-Day commemorations lacked the fanfare and high diplomatic and political significance they carry today. And there\u2019s an argument that the geopolitical symbolism has become too heavy and threatens to obscure the simple courage of dwindling groups of veterans who make a pilgrimage to honor slain comrades. But French and American presidents especially have used the gatherings as a stage to renew transatlantic bonds. In an especially significant piece of statecraft this time, the Western leaders will be joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has billed his nation\u2019s fight for survival after the Russian invasion as an echo of the allied battle against Hitler. Russian leaders or top officials have also attended the commemorations, at least since the end of the Cold War, in honor of the Soviet Union\u2019s staggering losses fighting the Nazis. But Putin is now a pariah and has not been invited. This year\u2019s event has important domestic connotations for several leaders. It will be the first of the decennial commemorations to feature Britain\u2019s King Charles III as head of state after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, a fixture in Normandy for decades. And it offers a stage for French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden, both politically weakened, to highlight their statesmanship at a moment of global turmoil. Biden will on Friday echo one of his predecessors, Ronald Reagan, who in 1984 traveled to a clifftop 100 feet high known as Pointe du Hoc, which was scaled in a daring raid by US Army Rangers on D-Day. Despite heavy losses, the Rangers seized German artillery pieces that could have caused even greater carnage of the Omaha and Utah invasion beaches. Reagan stood in front of a stone memorial shaped into the Rangers\u2019 emblem, with his back to the Channel, surrounded by surviving veterans of the raid, and gave one of the greatest presidential speeches. \u201cThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,\u201d Reagan said. He later confessed to his diary that he was so moved it was tough to get the words out. The speech came at a particularly contentious moment in the Cold War with tensions high between Washington and the Soviet Union. But Reagan\u2019s clarion call for freedom may have had an impact. Less than a year later, Mikhail Gorbachev became secretary general of the Soviet Communist Party and set in motion reforms and nuclear arms negotiations that led to the end of the Cold War. Biden, like the 40th president, is facing concerns about his age in his reelection year. And on Friday he will visit the same clifftop to make a similar call to save democracy. Reagan\u2019s Pointe du Hoc speech is not just remarkable for its poetry. Forty years on, it\u2019s stunningly relevant to a new political era. And it\u2019s equally striking how far the Republican Party has traveled from the man who once personified it to the anti-democratic American Firstism of its current hero. \u201cWe in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs. We\u2019re bound by reality. The strength of America\u2019s allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe\u2019s democracies. We were with you then; we are with you now. Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny.\u201d In 1984, Reagan could offer that promise without fear of contradiction. Biden cannot do the same in 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-d-day-american-leadership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_biden-trump-democracy-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is in Europe, warning of totalitarian evil and the dangers to democracy. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is back home, seeking a favor from Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, mulling revenge and trashing US elections. The former president is making his 2024 opponent\u2019s case \u2014 that the West is being challenged by unprecedented threats to the rule of law from hostile forces outside and in. But Trump\u2019s strength also suggests that the centerpiece of Biden\u2019s trip \u2014 an homage on Friday in Normandy to one of former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s greatest speeches \u2014 may fall on many deaf ears back in America. The former president is showing in every speech and public appearance that the seduction of demagoguery, the demonization of outsiders and the language of extremism is as potent now as it was before World War II. The 80th anniversary commemorations of the D-Day invasion that led to the liberation of Europe have turned into a rallying point for Western leaders warning that the darkest forces of political extremism are awakening. They have also used their meetings and speeches to draw parallels between Putin\u2019s vicious assault on Ukraine and Adolf Hitler\u2019s blitzkrieg. There\u2019s nothing new in a modern US president traveling to Europe to invoke the shared history of victory over tyranny. But no other commander in chief has done so after his predecessor tried to destroy democracy to stay in office. The possibility that Biden could lose reelection \u2014 and the threat of a return to the chaos Trump inflicted on European allies \u2014 has cast an ominous shadow over the trip. On Friday, Biden will send an unmistakable message by co-opting the legacy of Reagan \u2014 one of the greatest Republican presidents \u2014 to suggest that his rival is an affront to US and GOP values. In 1984, atop a cliff stormed by US Army Rangers on June 6, 1944, known as the Pointe du Hoc, the 40th president denounced US isolationism. He also invoked the war against Nazism to summon the West to a renewed and ultimately successful Cold War struggle against another form of extremism \u2014 Kremlin-style communism. Biden will imply that Trump, with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, attacks on the integrity of the free and fair 2020 election and use of extreme anti-immigrant rhetoric that echoes that of the Nazis, is summoning the same forces that triggered global war. Can the Gipper win one for Biden? Biden, who will almost certainly be the last US president to have been born during World War II, is asking Americans to muster the same commitment to democratic values as the greatest generation whose last representatives are now slipping away. \u201cIn memory of those who fought here, died here, literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice,\u201d Biden said Thursday, surrounded by the graves of more than 9,000 Americans. \u201cLet us be the generation that when history is written about our time \u2014 in 10, 20, 30, 50, 80 years from now \u2014 it will be said: \u2018When the moment came, we met the moment. We stood strong. Our alliances were made stronger.\u00a0And we saved democracy in our time as well.\u2019\u201d That a president should have to make such an argument shows how the political climate has shifted since Reagan stood on the same spot 40 years ago and filled many eyes with tears by turning to veterans and saying, \u201cThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who scaled the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped win a war.\u201d Back then, the GOP was an internationalist, pro-democracy party. It proudly boasted about how Reagan won the Cold War until Trump mixed his cocktail of isolationism and populism that looks more kindly on Putin than US allies. It is that defining shift in outlook that may mean that Biden\u2019s speech is an effective piece of political theater but has limited political appeal. The White House and the Biden campaign won\u2019t expect that invoking the spirit of the Gipper will dent Trump\u2019s lock on Republican base voters. But the president is seeking to win over disaffected national security Republicans nostalgic for the days when a hawkish foreign policy was seen as one leg of the fabled conservative policy stool. And he\u2019s especially seeking to attract some of the tens of thousands of Republicans who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the party\u2019s primary long after she suspended her campaign. The former United Nations ambassador under Trump might have endorsed her former boss and accused Biden of weakness on the global stage. But she\u2019s far more aligned with the current president\u2019s global outlook and disdain for dictators than she is with Trump\u2019s brand of strongman appeasement. Trump back on the trail Biden\u2019s visit to Europe has coincided with his predecessor\u2019s return to the campaign trail following his felony conviction last week in a hush money trial in New York. Trump chose the moment to issue his latest opening to Putin, an accused war criminal before whom he genuflected while president. The presumptive GOP nominee insisted that he\u2019d be able to free an imprisoned American reporter. \u201cEvan Gershkovich, the reporter for The Wall Street Journal who is being held by Russia, will be released almost immediately after the election,\u201d Trump said in a video posted on Truth Social on Tuesday. \u201cBut definitely before I assume office, he will be home, he will be safe. Vladimir Putin, President of Russia will do that for me \u2026 and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll do it for anyone else.\u201d This was far from the first time that Trump has sought to demonstrate special influence with Putin. After all, he once said in a news conference in Helsinki that he believed the Russian leader, who was standing beside him, rather than the US intelligence agencies he led, on the question of Kremlin election interference. Trump\u2019s politicization of the Gershkovich case was notable since it comes after months of quiet US government efforts to free the reporter and another imprisoned American, former Marine Paul Whelan. It raises the possibility that the Russians may simply manipulate any negotiations in the assumption that Trump may give them a better deal or that the Biden administration may be prepared to pay a higher price before the election. If the Kremlin eventually did free the reporter to Trump, it could be a coup for him and would ensure he is in Moscow\u2019s debt. Trump\u2019s outreach to Putin comes at a time when the Russian president is ostracized from the international community over the barbaric assaults on civilians in Ukraine and as he imposes the greatest threat to the integrity of continental Europe since the war that Biden flew across the Atlantic to commemorate. Using the plight of an American in the ruthless Russian penal system to score political points is also one of the more cynical modern campaign gambits. Russia shrugged off Trump\u2019s remarks on Thursday, saying that the release of Gershkovich would only happen as a result of reciprocity. After Trump played nice to Putin, the sitting president went out of his way to denounce the Russian leader, who was not invited to the D-Day events despite the Soviet Union\u2019s decisive role in the defeat of Nazism. \u201cHe\u2019s not a decent man \u2014 he\u2019s a dictator, and he\u2019s struggling to make sure he holds his country together while still keeping this assault going,\u201d Biden told ABC News in an interview. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was there instead. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s first campaign event as a felon on Thursday illustrated why the election could be so close. He was before a self-selecting crowd of supporters at a Turning Point Action Town Hall and spelled out a demagogic appeal that is effective with Republican base voters. He renewed his falsehoods about fraud in the last election, insisting he planned to win a mandate in November that was \u201ctoo big to rig.\u201d He attacked the legal system following his conviction by a jury of his peers, baselessly insisting that the verdict was \u201crigged.\u201d And in the border state of Arizona, he fired off searing anti-immigrant rhetoric, much of which was alarmist and false about the crisis on the border but that may prove an effective counterpoint to Biden\u2019s attempt this week to ease his exposure on the issue by massively curtailing asylum claims. The former president has consistently refused to guarantee he will accept the result of November\u2019s election. And several times this week, he has also implied that he would use presidential power to prosecute his political opponents, threatening a fresh assault on the rule of law. \u201cWell revenge does take time, I will say that, and sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest,\u201d Trump said during an interview with \u201cDr. Phil Primetime\u201d that aired Thursday. \u201cYou know, sometimes it can.\u201d At the Thursday town hall, the former president marveled at the fact that many of his questions, from an albeit friendly crowd, were about the high cost of living, the struggle of Arizonans to buy groceries and their perception that they are unsafe because of out-of-control arrivals of undocumented migrants at the border. This may be the decisive election equation in a nutshell: Trump will wield economic and immigration issues to counter Biden\u2019s warnings that his rival\u2019s anti-democratic and autocratic leanings make him unfit to be president again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/biden-trump-democracy-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_border-biden-trump-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is pulling from former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration playbook as he tries to stop a flow of asylum-seekers from around the world who are crossing into the US at the border with Mexico. Unveiled at the White House on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s new plan to all but shut down the US border to asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally uses executive authority Trump once used to bar people from mostly-Muslim countries from entering the US in 2017 and also to bar most asylum-seekers in 2018 \u2013 days after Republicans suffered huge setbacks in midterm elections that year. It\u2019s an odd, election-year twist, since Biden actually ran his 2020 campaign in part on a promise to revoke those actions, which he did in the months after taking office. Trump\u2019s asylum policy was also blocked by federal courts before Biden revoked it. In addition to slowing the flow of asylum-seekers, Biden\u2019s action could have the political effect of chipping away at Trump\u2019s lead on the immigration issue and triangulating some middle-ground support, even if it leaves progressives angry. Read the full story on Biden\u2019s announcement from CNN\u2019s White House team. Trump and Biden remain very far apart It\u2019s still very true that their rhetoric on immigrants remains very different. Biden expresses openness to immigrants as an important segment of American society. He wants to protect the children of undocumented immigrants who have grown up in the US and to create a pathway to citizenship for those already here. Trump routinely employs over-the-top rhetoric to demonize migrants and asylum-seekers as being from a criminal class or part of a coordinated invasion of the US, although there\u2019s no evidence to support those claims. Trump has promised a militaristic approach to the border and a massive deportation program if he\u2019s elected in November. Biden, meanwhile, has been pivoting to the middle on immigration all year. The decision to invoke executive authority comes months after a bipartisan border proposal in Congress failed to yield a new permanent law to reform the asylum process. Republican lawmakers, bowing to Trump, refused to work with the White House. Trump had said he wanted to run on the issue of immigration in this election year. Announcing the new action at the White House, Biden said he was trying \u201cto do what the Republicans in Congress refused to do.\u201d Even if he\u2019s adopting the authority behind Trump\u2019s policy, he promised not to adopt Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country,\u201d Biden said at the White House. Biden argued that exceptions in his action make it more humane than Trump\u2019s proposals. Asylum-seekers can still try to make an appointment with border officials and seek asylum at a port of entry. Expect challenges The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged Trump\u2019s border actions when he was president, now plans to challenge Biden. \u201cIt was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,\u201d Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement. But today\u2019s Supreme Court, which has a majority of conservative appointees, could be more friendly to Biden\u2019s action. Border crossings are actually down CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores reported from Hidalgo, Texas, on Tuesday and noted the decline in crossings. Whereas last December, there were around 250,000 border apprehensions, figures in recent months are less than 140,000, and Flores reported the figures dropped even further in May. The Biden plan would bar migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met, with some exemptions. The measure would stay in place until encounters drop below an average of 1,500 per day. Officials in Hidalgo County told Flores that any measures to address the influx of asylum-seekers would need to take into account the cross-border traffic that generates economic activity in the area. A top official in Hidalgo County, Judge Richard Cortez, told Flores that Biden\u2019s action, while welcome, was a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d and not a permanent solution. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform remains the sole solution and Congress remains the sole venue to achieve this reform,\u201d Cortez said in a statement to Flores. Flores described her interviews with women who became victims of sexual violence while waiting on the Mexico side of the border for asylum claims to be processed and pointed to the vulnerable position today\u2019s action could force migrants into if they wait on the Mexico side of the border. Why now? CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, reporting from the White House, said part of the administration\u2019s calculus had been to wait until after Mexico\u2019s presidential election, which took place over the weekend, to announce this new action. Americans\u2019 ability to cut border crossings will rest, she said, in part on Mexico\u2019s ability to stop the flow of asylum-seekers within its borders. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our Mexican neighbors instead of attacking Mexico,\u201d Biden said at the White House, drawing a distinction between his approach and Trump\u2019s. Biden said he spoke with Mexico\u2019s president-elect on Monday. Trump holds an advantage on immigration CNN\u2019s Harry Enten notes that in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration has taken on increasing importance in the minds of voters. Troubling for Biden is that Trump is favored by 27 percentage points on the issue, according to polling from CNBC. Watch more from Enten: Long-standing authority Presidents have been using the authority to act on the border for decades; it is based in a 1950s immigration law. Here\u2019s the specific language: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The authority has routinely been used, according to the Congressional Research Service, by all recent presidents to restrict entry to the US for specific groups of people, like Europeans at one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, suspected terrorists or officials from countries like Iran. A fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security outlines the specific changes in how noncitizens will be processed at the border. People apprehended and slated for expedited removal would need to express fear of returning to their home country in order to be interviewed about their situation. Otherwise, they will quickly be returned to either Mexico or their home country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/border-biden-trump-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_takeaways-day-4-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "The prosecution\u2019s most important witness against Hunter Biden, his sister-in-law-turned-girlfriend Hallie Biden, testified Thursday that she believed he was using drugs when she saw him in October 2018, the month he claimed on a federal background check that he was clean. Jurors\u00a0sat forward in their seats while she was on the witness stand. Some who have rarely taken notes jotted on their notepads as she provided critical testimony that filled in some lingering gaps about the time when Biden bought the gun. Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son, is charged with three felonies, stemming from prosecutors\u2019 claim that he was using or addicted to drugs when he bought and owned a revolver in October 2018. He pleaded not guilty. He has spoken openly about his yearslong addiction to crack cocaine, and a key witness already testified that she watched him smoking the drug in September and November 2018. Before court wrapped, special counsel David Weiss\u2019 team announced that they planned to rest their case on Friday, after they present testimony from two experts from the FBI and DEA. That puts the case on track to potentially head to the jury early next week, Hunter Biden\u2019s lead attorney said. Biden\u2019s defense team plans to call his daughter, Naomi Biden, and his uncle, James Biden, to testify as they begin to present their case Friday, people briefed on their plans said. Biden\u2019s lead attorney Abbe Lowell suggested that jurors could hear from them during his opening statement. Naomi Biden\u2019s testimony is expected to bolster the defense\u2019s effort to blunt the impact of testimony from Hallie Biden. James Biden\u2019s testimony is intended to help jurors hear about Hunter Biden\u2019s efforts during the key period of 2018 to seek drug addiction treatment, some of which his uncle \u2013 the president\u2019s brother \u2013 paid for. Here\u2019s what to know from the trial\u2019s fourth day in Wilmington, Delaware: Star witness Hallie Biden In many ways, Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who then dated his brother Hunter, was teed up to be the special counsel\u2019s star witness. She\u2019s the only person expected to testify who saw Biden in October 2018, when he returned to Delaware and bought the .38 caliber Colt Cobra revolver. She testified that she believed \u2013 based on her observations and his behavior \u2013 that Biden was using crack cocaine around October 22 and 23, days after he purchased the pistol. However, under cross-examination, she acknowledged she didn\u2019t personally see Biden using drugs in the month of October, a point the defense team has zeroed in on \u2013 trying to carve out October and create reasonable doubt. She also said she didn\u2019t see a lot of Biden in October. Jurors saw messages between the two where she was trying to get ahold of him, and wondering if he was seeing other women. In one message from that time period, she asked, \u201cAre you in New York with Zoe?\u201d referring to Zoe Kestan, who was romantically involved with Biden around the same time and testified about his rampant drug abuse. Lowell challenged Hallie Biden repeatedly during his extensive cross-examination. Hallie Biden \u2018panicked\u2019 and threw out the gun Hallie Biden described how events spiraled out of control after she found Biden\u2019s gun on October 23, \u201cpanicked\u201d and drove to a grocery store to throw the pistol in a trashcan. \u201cI panicked and I wanted to get rid of them \u2026 because I didn\u2019t want him to hurt himself or I didn\u2019t want my kids to find it and hurt themselves, and I just panicked and wanted to get rid of it,\u201d she testified. She then drove to Janssen\u2019s Market, a grocery store just a couple minutes away, and threw it in a trash can. Hunter Biden quickly discovered that his gun was missing and things went south, according to text messages shown to the jury. He was very angry, she testified. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe anyone is that stupid,\u201d he texted her amid the crisis, according to the messages presented by prosecutors. She later replied, \u201cYou can blame me all you want. I know it was stupid, but your part is dangerous and negligent. And because of this and my stupidity for being worried about you, I\u2019m dealing with insanity and possibly I\u2019m the one going to get in trouble.\u201d During cross-examination, Hallie Biden repeatedly said she didn\u2019t recall details from the day, including around phone calls between her and Hunter Biden or the timing of when she found the gun in his truck and where all she went that day. \u201cThere are some things you remember and many things you don\u2019t,\u201d Lowell told her, pointedly. Hallie Biden\u2019s drug use Early in her testimony, Hallie Biden testified to using drugs, saying that Hunter Biden introduced her to crack cocaine in 2018. \u201cIt was a terrible experience that I went through, and I\u2019m embarrassed and I\u2019m ashamed, and I regret that period of my life,\u201d she said. She said she quit in August 2018. She later said she went to rehab in Pennsylvania in early October 2018. Biden attended some \u201ccounseling\u201d with her as part of the treatment, she said. Lowell suggested this was the reason why Hunter Biden returned from Los Angeles to Delaware \u2013 which is where he bought the gun weeks later. Finding the gun Delaware State Police Lt. Millard Greer later testified about the series of events that led to the recovery of Biden\u2019s gun, after Hallie Biden reported it missing. Through security footage and interviews, investigators learned that an elderly man who liked to rummage around trash bins for recyclables may have taken the gun out of the trashcan that Hallie Biden had dropped it in. Greer said he surveilled the man at a Fidelity Investments storefront in the area, before approaching him later. The man, Thomas Banner, acknowledged that he found something very important in the trash. They went back to his home to retrieve the gun, but Banner was locked out of his house and started \u201cpanicking,\u201d Greer said. They eventually got inside, and Banner led Greer to the gun, which\u00a0Greer said\u00a0was\u00a0stuffed\u00a0in a sock\u00a0inside\u00a0a General Motors lunchbox.\u00a0He also, to Greer\u2019s surprise, handed over a second gun that he said he\u00a0had been\u00a0holding on to for years, and was given\u00a0to him\u00a0by a coworker who needed to get rid of\u00a0it to protect his brother. The 80-year-old Banner later took the stand, and both Lowell and prosecutor Derek Hines stood inches away from him during questioning, speaking in slow, clear words because he was hard of hearing.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_voters-trump-conviction-2024", "text": "Some things take time to sink in. But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_austin-cnn-interview", "text": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0told CNN\u00a0Thursday he believed the new policy allowing the Ukrainian military\u00a0to carry out limited strikes inside Russia with US munitions\u00a0will\u00a0be \u201cvery, very helpful to the Ukrainians going forward.\u201d \u201c[W]hat we have done is provided Ukraine the ability to counter fire, to fire back at those Russian troops that are firing at them and to be able to take out their artillery batteries as they\u2019re firing at the Ukrainians,\u201d Austin told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer\u00a0on\u00a0\u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Austin spoke with CNN from Normandy, France, where he has joined other world leaders for the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day, including President Joe Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown, and more than 20 other heads of state including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Austin\u2019s comments came days after Biden\u00a0gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russian territory \u2014 though limiting it to targets close to the border of Kharkiv\u00a0where Russian forces have been concentrating their efforts \u2014 with US munitions. Asked about waning support in the US, Austin said he believed there has been \u201cstrong support for Ukraine\u201d among both political parties, despite how long it took for Congress to pass its security aid package for the embattled country\u00a0and emphasized that\u00a0Russian President Vladimir\u00a0Putin likely won\u2019t stop at Ukraine. \u201cI was confident that the right thing was going to happen, because anytime you see that type of support on both sides of the aisle for a cause, Congress will find a way to get things done. Which is what they did in this case, because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ukraine matters \u2026 not just for Ukraine\u2019s purposes alone, not for Europe alone \u2014\u00a0it matters for to us and it matters to the entire globe.\u00a0So, we have to make sure that Putin doesn\u2019t have the ability to trample Ukraine because as the president said there\u2019s a good chance, almost certain, that Putin won\u2019t stop there. He will continue to move forward in other acts of aggression.\u201d On Thursday, Biden gave a blistering critique of Putin, telling ABC News\u2019 David Muir that Putin is \u201cnot a decent man, he\u2019s a dictator.\u201d Standing in the Normandy American Cemetery, Austin told CNN he believed the \u201cnumber of leaders who lean towards autocracy\u201d around the globe pose the greatest threat to the US, and that the sacrifice so many gave to \u201censure our freedom\u201d should never be forgotten. \u201c[I]t\u2019s those sacrifices that really gave birth to the rules-based international order that served us so well for so many years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to protect that \u2014\u00a0we have to work hard to protect it. Democracy is worth having, but it\u2019s something that you have to work on, you have to fight for.\u201d \u2018Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people\u2019 Austin declined on Thursday to comment on an overnight Israeli strike in Gaza on a UN-run school that was housing displaced people, which killed at least 45 people, saying he would \u201cleave it to Israel to talk about what happened in that strike.\u201d He emphasized though that Israel must take more actions to avoid civilian casualties, and that accomplishing their military objectives and protecting civilians should not be mutually exclusive. \u201cI think the way you ensure long-term success is by making sure that you take the civilian population, eventually strip them away from Hamas, and demonstrate that Hamas does not equal the Palestinian people,\u201d Austin said. Asked if he believes Israel has committed war crimes in its operations against Hamas in Gaza, Austin echoed Biden\u2019s comments that it is \u201cuncertain\u201d and should be investigated, which he said Israel would be doing. \u201cThis is a professional force,\u201d he said, \u201cand we would expect they do the kinds of things that professional forces do, you know, make sure they\u2019re doing the right things to employ the weapons appropriately, and also if there are problems, investigate those problems and learn from that.\u201d So far, Austin said, the US has still not seen Israel begin a \u201cmajor movement into Rafah.\u201d US and China must \u2018continue to have a dialogue\u2019 Austin also spoke briefly on Thursday about challenges in the Indo-Pacific and his recent meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Adm. Dong Jun, in Singapore. He reiterated that it is important for the US and China to \u201ccontinue to have a dialogue\u201d and that he voiced concerns over what is happening in the region. Just two weeks ago, China launched military drills encircling Taiwan after the democratic island swore in a new president. \u201cI voiced my concerns about some of the things that we\u2019ve seen in the region, and we\u2019ll continue to do so going forward,\u201d Austin said. \u201cBut unless you\u2019re talking to each other, you don\u2019t have the ability to prevent miscalculations and address misperceptions. So I think this is a good first step, but there\u2019s a lot more that needs to be done in terms of engaging and in terms of moving things in the right direction.\u201d This story has been updated with\u00a0additional\u00a0details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/austin-cnn-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_biden-administration-allies-hamas-ceasefire", "text": "The Biden administration has spent the last week pushing\u00a0allies in the\u00a0Middle East\u00a0to make specific threats to Hamas, as part of an urgent campaign to push the group toward accepting the latest Israeli ceasefire and hostage proposal\u00a0that would pause the fighting in Gaza. US officials have publicly called on\u00a0the group\u00a0to accept previous\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0proposals on the table as Israel and Hamas\u00a0have engaged\u00a0in months of back-and-forth negotiations, but\u00a0there has never been an all-out\u00a0pressure campaign marked by specific asks to individual countries\u00a0as part of\u00a0the Biden administration\u2019s push. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has\u00a0held almost a dozen calls\u00a0with key players in\u00a0the region since Friday\u00a0and\u00a0other top State Department officials have been intimately involved in the all-hands on deck effort. White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk traveled to Egypt this week and\u00a0CIA Director Bill Burns went to\u00a0Qatar\u00a0in the hopes of adding traction to the negotiations,\u00a0but US officials have remained largely mum on the trips so far, citing the sensitivity of the ongoing\u00a0diplomatic work. An initial response from Hamas on Wednesday\u00a0to the most recent Israeli proposal, as publicly described by President Joe Biden last week,\u00a0appeared to\u00a0signal that the\u00a0gaps may still be significant.\u00a0While it welcomed what Biden laid out, upon seeing the proposal brought by mediators, Hamas said that it \u201cturned out to be devoid of the positive foundations contained in Biden\u2019s statements.\u201d \u201cIt does not guarantee a permanent ceasefire, but rather a temporary one\u201d and allows for Israeli forces to remain in Gaza territory, the group said\u00a0in a statement obtained by CNN. Still,\u00a0the Biden administration believes there is\u00a0an opportunity to close the deal, one US official\u00a0said. A different source told CNN Thursday that\u00a0Egypt has received encouraging signs from Hamas on the latest proposal, though they declined to detail exactly what those positive indications were. Hamas is expected to respond to Israel\u2019s proposal in the coming days, sources said. As the Israel-Hamas conflict is on the eve of entering its ninth month, US officials are urging Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to turn up the heat on Hamas by using multiple pressure points.\u00a0They\u2019ve asked multiple countries to threaten\u00a0to\u00a0freeze\u00a0the bank accounts of Hamas members and\u00a0clamp\u00a0down on\u00a0their\u00a0ability to freely travel in the region, according to two US officials. In many cases,\u00a0members of Hamas have long been able to operate\u00a0freely\u00a0despite members of the\u00a0terror\u00a0group. The US has urged Qatar \u2013\u00a0who allows Hamas to operate a political office in its capital \u2013 to declare that it will kick out the terrorist group if they don\u2019t accept the deal, according to\u00a0one of those\u00a0US officials. After months of telling Hamas that they could\u00a0risk getting kicked out, Qatar has now actually made that threat,\u00a0that official said. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said on Wednesday that the US\u00a0has seen both Egypt and Qatar \u201cexert significant pressure on Hamas,\u201d but he refused to get into the details of those separate pressure campaigns. \u201cWe have seen both countries play I think an incredibly important role in mediating this deal, in making clear that this deal is in the interests of the Palestinian people, and doing so appropriately,\u201d Miller said. US officials privately say that Egypt is putting more pressure on Hamas than they have in the past, but the specifics of exactly how far the Egyptians have gone in their private dialogue with\u00a0the group\u00a0remain\u00a0unclear.\u00a0They say the US wants Cairo to threaten to cut off the access points from Egypt to Gaza, a key lifeline for the enclave. Biden unleashed the pressure campaign The Biden administration\u2019s\u00a0intense\u00a0pressure campaign coincides with\u00a0Biden\u2019s speech\u00a0last\u00a0Friday declaring that Hamas must accept the Israeli proposal on the table.\u00a0Biden laid out three phases of a\u00a0deal that\u00a0he said the Israelis\u00a0had\u00a0transmitted to Hamas\u00a0the night before he spoke. \u201cAnd as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposals, \u2018the cessation of hostilities permanently,\u2019\u201d Biden said of the deal. The Biden administration had been considering Biden\u00a0giving a speech\u00a0addressing the Israeli public for some time and\u00a0last week\u2019s address came together quickly as an opportunity to do so. \u201cIt was a very busy weekend after the president\u2019s speech, with everyone working the phones, talking to regional interlockers and pressing them to get Hamas to accept the deal,\u201d\u00a0one US\u00a0official said. As US officials have feverishly gamed out every lever they can pull,\u00a0there has been private acknowledgement by some that there is no\u00a0plan B for what would happen if Hamas comes back with a rejection\u00a0\u2013 a reality that\u00a0adds to the\u00a0weight of this moment. The US political calendar also remains a key factor.\u00a0US officials\u00a0had hoped for the war to end by the beginning of the calendar year, well before the presidential campaign\u2019s general election got underway. But with the ceasefire negotiations halting to a stop at multiple junctures, now, the Democratic National Convention where Biden is set to formally receive his party\u2019s nomination is now\u00a0less than three months away, adding to the urgency\u00a0that Biden allies feel as the backlash against the war only continues to mount at home. And now, one week after the latest Israeli proposal was transmitted to Hamas, it remains unclear if the pressure campaign will succeed. US officials say they have a decent idea of how to exert pressure that would impact the members of Hamas who are operating outside of the battlefield in Gaza, but the paramount challenge is convincing\u00a0Yahya Sinwar \u2013 Hamas\u2019 leader\u00a0in Gaza\u00a0who is believed to be hiding underground\u00a0\u2013 to accept the deal. Miller acknowledged Wednesday that Sinwar might not see it as in his interest to accept the deal on the table.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-administration-allies-hamas-ceasefire/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_arizona-fake-electors-jake-hoffman", "text": "Arizona state Sen. Jake Hoffman on Thursday pleaded not guilty to multiple felony charges related to the Republican lawmaker\u2019s alleged role in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results. His attorney, Timothy La Sota, entered the plea on his client\u2019s\u00a0behalf. Hoffman appeared before Court Commissioner Shellie Smith via Zoom\u00a0\u2013 with a painting of Ronald Reagan on a wall behind him \u2013\u00a0after an Arizona\u00a0grand jury handed up an indictment against him and 17 other defendants in April. He was charged alongside 10 other individuals who served as fake electors from the state and multiple close allies of former President Donald Trump. Hoffman, who was\u00a0elected\u00a0as a member of the Republican National Committee for Arizona just days after being indicted in April, told the judge he has plans to travel out of state this summer to attend various pre-planned Republican events. The judge released Hoffman on his own recognizance and will \u201callow travel for purposes\u00a0of his employment.\u201d His next court date is a pre-trial hearing set for July 2. Hoffman\u00a0sent a two-page letter\u00a0to Vice President Mike\u00a0Pence on January 5, 2021, asking him to order that Arizona\u2019s electors not be decided by the popular vote of its citizens, but instead by members of the state Legislature. \u201cIt is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,\u201d\u00a0Hoffman\u00a0wrote at the time. In\u00a0interviews,\u00a0Hoffman repeatedly argued that no electors be sent at all because \u201cwe don\u2019t have certainty in the outcome of our election\u201d and called to contest Democratic electors if they were sent. Following news of his indictment,\u00a0Hoffman\u00a0said in a statement that he was \u201cinnocent of any crime,\u201d adding, \u201cI will vigorously defend\u00a0myself, and I look forward to the day when I am vindicated of this disgusting political persecution by the judicial process.\u201d The Arizona Republican Party also condemned the indictment,\u00a0calling it\u00a0a \u201cblatant and unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial power.\u201d Others charged in the indictment include former Trump lawyer John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn.\u00a0Giuliani and Eastman pleaded not guilty last month.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_biden-putin-russia-ukraine-us-weapons", "text": "President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a fierce critique of Russian President Vladimir Putin while defending his decision give Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes within Russia using US weapons. \u201cI\u2019ve known [Putin] for over 40 years -\u2013 he\u2019s concerned me for 40 years,\u201d Biden told ABC News\u2019 David Muir. \u201cHe\u2019s not a decent man -\u2013 he\u2019s a dictator, and he\u2019s struggling to make sure he holds his country together while still keeping this assault going. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about giving [Ukraine] weapons to strike Moscow, to strike the Kremlin, to strike \u2013 it\u2019s just across the border, where they\u2019re receiving significant fire from conventional weapons used by the Russians to go into the Ukraine, to kill the Ukrainians,\u201d the president said, appearing to exaggerate how long he had been aware of Putin given that the Russian leader was serving as a KGB agent in East Germany 40 years ago. Biden\u2019s decision to loosen restrictions around the use of US weapons in Ukraine came after Russia made significant advances around the city in the northeastern part of the country close to the Russian border. While it marked a break from long-standing policy, it is limited to the area around Kharkiv,\u00a0and Ukraine has not requested permission beyond that, a US official previously told CNN, adding that they do not anticipate the US widening the area allowed. On Wednesday, Putin warned Western countries they\u2019re taking a \u201cvery serious and dangerous step\u201d by supplying weapons to Ukraine, which could result in Moscow arming their enemies. \u201cSupplying weapons to a conflict zone is always a bad thing,\u201d Putin told editors from international news agencies on the sidelines of the annual economic forum in St. Petersburg on Wednesday. \u201cEspecially if this is linked to the fact that those who supply them are not only delivering weapons but managing them.\u201d Biden, however, insisted Thursday, \u201cThey\u2019re authorized to be used in proximity to the border. We\u2019re not authorizing strikes 200 miles into Russia, we\u2019re not authorizing strikes on Moscow, on the Kremlin.\u201d The initial limits preventing Ukraine from firing into Russian territory with US weaponry were rooted in the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about the war escalating. While those concerns remain, the US moved to change position after the Ukrainian government explicitly cited the need to defend Kharkiv, European allies began changing tack and NATO leadership quietly urged the US to allow such strikes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-putin-russia-ukraine-us-weapons/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_revenge-tour-trump-republicans", "text": "Friendly interviewers have offered Donald Trump several chances over the past week to walk away from the threats of retaliation coming from him and his allies in the wake of his felony conviction. The former president, though, has repeatedly refused to close the door on it. The latest example came Thursday in an interview with psychologist Phil McGraw. The television host better known as Dr. Phil repeatedly urged Trump to rise above the impulse to fight back and instead focus on fixing the country. \u201cYou have so much to do,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to get even. You only have time to get right.\u201d Trump responded with a smirk. \u201cWell, revenge does take time. I will say that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes revenge can be justified. Phil, I have to be honest. You know, sometimes it can.\u201d The remark echoed another from earlier in the week when Trump declined several opportunities offered by Fox News host and close friend Sean Hannity to dial back his calls for retribution. \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president said. The exchange was reminiscent of Hannity\u2019s previous attempts to get Trump to assure Americans he wouldn\u2019t abuse power if he returned to the White House. Instead of dismissing the suggestion outright, Trump told Hannity in December, \u201cExcept for day one.\u201d Trump\u2019s refusal to take the off-ramp comes amid escalating calls for retribution from his allies in the days since a Manhattan jury convicted the former president on 34 felony counts related to payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 election. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo, an attorney in the prosecutor\u2019s office, testify \u201cabout the unprecedented political prosecution of President Trump.\u201d Several Republican senators \u2014 including vice presidential contenders Marco Rubio of Florida and JD Vance of Ohio \u2014 signed a letter signifying they would not work with the Biden administration to pass legislation, confirm his judicial nominees or increase non-security spending. \u201cIt\u2019s time to fight (fire emoji) with (fire emoji),\u201d Rubio wrote on social media. Others have publicly urged Republicans to use the levers of power to immediately target Trump\u2019s political opponents. Former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, appearing on Fox News after Trump\u2019s conviction,\u00a0suggested the House GOP flex its subpoena authority and Republican prosecutors open investigations. \u201cEvery facet of Republican Party politics and power has to be used right now,\u201d Miller said. The open calls for revenge have effectively put retaliation on the ballot this November, and Trump allies have said as much. Russell Vought, a former top official in the Trump administration now helping to plan for the Republican\u2019s potential return to Washington, wrote on social media: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about winning an election to shift the see saw toward our agenda.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about demanding that our leaders destroy this threat at every level with every tool. And if you can\u2019t rise to that level of historical awareness, then simply put, you are not needed,\u201d Vought said. Some Trump advisers have attempted to play down Trump\u2019s remarks. Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Wednesday that concern over the escalating rhetoric around retaliation was \u201cthe new narrative by all the lemmings in the mainstream media this week.\u201d \u201cIf you need any evidence,\u201d Conway said, \u201clook no further than how (Trump) just stood down in any kind of prosecution of Hillary Clinton and retribution after he beat her fairly and squarely and racked up 304 electoral votes in 2016.\u201d \u201cMany people said, \u2018Lock her up,\u2019\u201d she added, ignoring that Trump was one of those people. Yet, the next day, Trump on social media called for the indictment of the eight current and former members of Congress who served on the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. His post came as a federal judge ruled that former Trump adviser Steve Bannon must report to prison on July 1 for refusing to provide documents and testimony to the committee. Trump launched his third campaign for president still seething over his 2020 defeat and signaling revenge against those who kept him from a second term. In March 2023, Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference: \u201cI am your retribution.\u201d At the urging of some advisers, Trump has at times stepped back from the harsh rhetoric. Trump told the same conservative gathering earlier this year, \u201cRetribution is going to be through success.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment Trump has repeated many times since \u2014 including in the days after his hush money trial ended \u2014 but it\u2019s not one he appears fully committed to. Asked in a Fox News appearance after the verdict if he still felt that way, Trump replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough question in one way because these are really bad people.\u201d In his interview with McGraw, Trump posited, \u201cMaybe we have revenge through success\u201d before suggesting more direct retaliation would be warranted. After his interview with Trump, McGraw told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip that he tried to get the former president to understand that a \u201crevenge tour\u201d wouldn\u2019t heal the country and bring people together. He acknowledged, though, that Trump might not see it that way. \u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cThis is something that I think he had in his mind, that there\u2019s one way to go, and that\u2019s to get even. I think I really made some headway with him that that is not the way to go. I think it\u2019s a process.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/revenge-tour-trump-republicans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_joe-biden-pointe-du-hoc-speech", "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday summoned Americans to a defense of democracy, calling on the ideals of the Army Rangers who scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc 80 years ago to warn against a drift toward authoritarianism and drawing an implicit contrast with rival Donald Trump. Speaking from a concrete bunker where the US troops sought to dismantle German artillery, Biden said those men \u2013 none of whom are still alive today \u2013 would want their modern day fellow citizens to do their part to protect against autocrats. \u201cThey\u2019re not asking us to scale these cliffs,\u201d Biden said in his 15-minute speech. \u201cBut they\u2019re asking us to stay true to what America stands for. They\u2019re not asking us to give or risk our lives. But they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re asking us to do our job, to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up to aggression abroad and at home to be part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d he went on. The clear skies and azure Atlantic water Biden spoke in front of was a distant cry from the harrowing day he was describing in his speech. But with war once more on Western Europe\u2019s doorstep and a rival in the United States who has vowed to act as a dictator on his first day in office should he win in November, Biden sought to use D-Day as a call to modern vigilance. \u201cAs we gather here today, it\u2019s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day, June 6, 1944. It\u2019s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us,\u201d he said. In a week filled with poignant images featuring America\u2019s Greatest Generation, the speech stood out as a call to modern-day action against an isolationist streak seeping into American politics and a rise of authoritarianism around the world. Not lost on White House aides planning the speech was the one delivered on the same spot 40 years ago by Ronald Reagan, a Republican who issued warnings against isolationism in the face of tyranny. Eighty years after the allied landings, the president drew a \u201cthroughline\u201d from World War II to today. He didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, but the contrast was clear. Biden has repeatedly cast Trump\u2019s embrace of authoritarian leaders \u2013 including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un \u2013 as a threat to democracy. The president, Sullivan continued, will \u201creally be drawing a throughline from World War II through the Cold War and the stand up of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, the NATO alliance, to today, where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe.\u201d Biden,\u00a0a senior administration official told CNN, will \u201cfocus on the veterans of World War II and what we owe them and how we have to live up to their example \u2013 and the power of democracy.\u201d It comes as Biden is facing duel international crises: In Ukraine, where the US is hoping to turn the tide of Russia\u2019s offensive, and in the Middle East, where the Biden administration is calling on Hamas to accept an agreement on a ceasefire and hostage proposal. A monthslong delay in providing additional American assistance to Ukraine, prompted in part by resistance from Republicans aligned with Trump, led to setbacks on the battlefield and momentum for Russia. The strain of isolationism has led to concerns in Europe and elsewhere about what a return by Trump to the White House might portend. Biden announced a new aid package for Ukraine in a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday, touting the new funding for the war-torn region while apologizing for the delay. \u201cYou know, you haven\u2019t bowed down, you haven\u2019t yielded at all, you continue to fight in a way that is just remarkable, is just remarkable \u2013 and we\u2019re not going to walk away from you,\u201d Biden told the Ukrainian president. \u201cI apologize for the weeks of not knowing what\u2019s going to pass, in terms of funding, because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up, but we got it done.\u201d Still, he took the opportunity to tout Friday\u2019s funding announcement, as well as the additional funding sent to Ukraine since he signed the bill in April. \u201cSince then, including today, I\u2019ve announced six packages of significant funding today Including today \u2013 today I\u2019m also signing an additional package for $225 million to reconstruct the electric grid,\u201d he said. By speaking at Pointe du Hoc, Biden is harkening back to one of the most famous presidential speeches ever delivered, the 40th\u00a0anniversary D-Day address by Reagan. Reagan delivered a forceful rebuke of authoritarianism framed through the lens of the bravery of \u201cthe boys of Pointe du Hoc.\u201d The senior administration official said:\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s not going to be comparisons.\u201d That speech, like Biden\u2019s, occurred at a moment of contention with Russia. Flanked by the men who fought there, Reagan, another aging president running for reelection, made a forceful call for the power of democracy.\u00a0 \u201cYou all knew that some things are worth dying for. One\u2019s country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it\u2019s the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you,\u201d Reagan said. Like Biden, he also warned about American withdrawal from the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments,\u201d Reagan said then. Biden has taken centerpiece speeches on democracy on a traveling road show. It was a key theme of his 2022 State of the Union address as he defined the battle between democracy and autocracy as the key question of this moment in history. He said that the defense, protection, and preservation of American democracy was \u201cthe central cause of my presidency\u201d as he honored the late GOP Sen. John McCain in Tempe, Arizona, in September 2023. He highlighted unified support for democracy ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland, in February 2023. And on the eve of the third anniversary of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, earlier this year, Biden cast the value Americans place on democracy as the \u201cmost urgent question of our time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/joe-biden-pointe-du-hoc-speech/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to call out his predecessor Donald Trump as a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d for the first time represents a significant hardening of his rhetoric against his Republican general election foe. Biden\u2019s escalation at an off-camera fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday evening came as some Democrats pressed for a more robust political attack on the presumptive Republican nominee following his guilty verdict in his New York hush money trial last week. \u201cFor the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\u201d Other Democratic officials have used such rhetoric. But the phrase took on greater force coming from the mouth of the president himself. While Republicans have rallied around Trump since his conviction, it remains unclear how the verdict will go down in swing states where the shift in a few thousand votes could decide November\u2019s election. Biden\u2019s remark was yet another stunning turn in an election entangled in Trump\u2019s multiple legal threats. It came on a day when the first family was embroiled in its own extraordinary courtroom drama as Biden\u2019s son Hunter became the first child of a sitting president to go on trial. The younger Biden has pleaded not guilty to charges of buying and possessing a gun illegally while addicted to or abusing drugs. He also faces a tax trial in September. Last week, Biden noted that Trump had been convicted on 34 felony counts and said it was \u201creckless \u2026 dangerous \u2026 and irresponsible\u201d for his opponent to say the verdict was rigged. Presidential remarks in off-camera fundraisers can often serve as a test bed for rhetoric that later emerges in public events. But Biden\u2019s sharpened tone will certainly lead to accusations by the Trump campaign that the former president\u2019s conviction came after a process of political weaponization of the justice system. In another significant legal development Monday, Trump got good news from Georgia, where he is among multiple defendants in a racketeering case over his attempt to steal the swing state from Biden\u2019s column in the 2020 election. The Georgia Court of Appeals set oral arguments for October 4 over an effort to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. It was just the latest blow to prosecutors pursuing Trump over his election interference case. The timing of the arguments \u2014 only a month before Election Day \u2014 makes for an impossibly short timeframe for a trial. The Georgia case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been delayed by defendants\u2019 attempt to disqualify Willis after she employed a prosecutor with whom she was in a relationship. Other Trump cases are in suspended animation Two federal cases against Trump, in which he\u2019s also pleaded not guilty, are in a holding pattern. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on Trump\u2019s sweeping demand for immunity for actions he undertook while president. The justices could still deliver a definitive ruling, but any decision that requires further litigation in lower courts could mean time runs out in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case with only five months to go before Election Day. At the same time, multiple disputes in pre-trial motions have put the looming federal trial in Florida over Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents into suspended animation. Democrats have accused Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon of showing political bias in her rulings. The logjam on multiple fronts means that it may prove impossible for the US legal system to account for the alleged attempt by a former president to stay in power against the will of voters before he has the chance to win another mandate. In itself, the delay represents a significant threat to American democracy\u2019s bid to save itself since it suggests that a future president who acted the same way Trump did might expect impunity. Trump\u2019s avoidance of accountability over 2020 election interference \u2014 through a mixture of skilled litigation by his lawyers, some backfiring decisions by prosecutors and luck \u2014 would also hugely raise the stakes of November\u2019s election. If Trump loses, his future after already losing one criminal case looks incredibly grim, with three cases that are likely to eventually get to trials that will entail massive legal fees. But if Trump wins, he could appoint an attorney general who could halt the federal cases in their tracks. And his Justice Department would be sure to make every effort to delay or defray any negative outcome he faces in the Georgia case as well as the New York hush money conviction that is due to proceed to sentencing on July 11. Given the personal stakes, it\u2019s reasonable to assume Trump will not stop at anything to regain power at a time when he\u2019s refusing to guarantee accepting the result of the 2024 election. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House counsel, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday that the date set in Georgia in October means there is \u201cno possibility of this case going to trial before the election.\u201d\u00a0And he added that the chances were rising that Trump could avoid any legal accountability for his actions in 2020 if he wins in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s very real if he wins the election, it\u2019s not real at all if he loses,\u201d Cobb said. Referring to the federal election interference case and the classified documents matter, Cobb said, \u201cBoth of those will end up going at some point if Trump loses in early to mid next year and the Georgia case will likely follow that along.\u201d History made in Delaware The sluggish pace of Trump\u2019s criminal trials contrasts with the efficiency of those facing Hunter Biden, who\u2019s also due to face trial on tax charges in September. The cases of the former president and the current president\u2019s son are not analogous, and those surrounding Trump are hugely complicated. But they are sure to leave many Democrats marveling at the prospect that the only federal trial entangled with this year\u2019s election could be one that is targeting Hunter Biden and not Trump, whose actions after the 2020 election stretched US democracy to its limit. Joe Biden pledged on Monday not to comment on the outcome of a federal trial, but in a statement, he expressed boundless love for his son and his respect for his success in overcoming addiction to crack cocaine. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a dad,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s cranked up rhetoric at the Monday fundraiser follows a warning by Trump in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday of the consequences if Judge Juan Merchan imposed any jail term following the guilty verdict last week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the public would stand for it,\u201d the former president said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there\u2019s a breaking point.\u201d Some senior Democrats accused Trump of inciting violence in his remarks, which took on a more ominous complexion given his past invocation to supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \u201cThis is clearly Donald Trump once again inciting violence, potential violence, when he is sentenced,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff told Kasie Hunt on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\u00a0 The California Democrat accused Trump of issuing \u201cyet another dangerous appeal to violence.\u201d The extraordinary tangling of the 2024 election and legal cases weighing on both Trump and Biden is likely to dominate a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday when Attorney General Merrick Garland will brave a new grilling by Republicans. Garland vowed to restore trust in the legal system when he took office following the tumultuous Trump years by making sure everyone plays by the same rules. Three years on, he\u2019s frustrated much of Washington with a quest that looks quaint in an era when judges, prosecutors and juries in a proliferating wave of politically loaded cases are under almost constant attack. But hostility toward Garland has not come just from Republicans, who will be looking for vengeance on Tuesday following Trump\u2019s conviction. Democrats fret over the slow pace of the federal investigations. And the White House complained to Garland after special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report on Joe Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents portrayed the president\u2019s memory as significantly degraded in a report that unleashed weeks of political reverberations, CNN reported. Garland is also likely to face scrutiny over the Hunter Biden trial. House Republicans have seized on the case to try to damage the president politically, especially after failing to provide any evidence that he profited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in their misfiring impeachment investigation. Republicans celebrated when a plea deal, which they saw as \u201csweetheart\u201d treatment for Hunter Biden, collapsed in court. But the Hunter Biden trial, as well as a federal corruption trial targeting New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, undercuts Republican claims of a biased justice system made in the wake of the Trump verdict in New York last week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_tim-scott-black-latino-voters-outreach", "text": "South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a contender to be former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, is launching a multimillion dollar effort to recruit Black voters to support Republicans in 2024. The effort will target swing and low propensity Black and Latino voters. Scott will tour battleground states and host smaller events in the coming weeks as he makes direct appeals to voters of color, with the hope that they will shift their support to the GOP. The plan, which is being backed by Scott\u2019s Great Opportunity PAC, is to spend more than $14 million, including $5 million on earned and paid media. It will focus primarily on Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, where thin margins may determine the outcome of the presidential election. A source familiar with the plans said that the goal is to get started as soon as possible. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign are aware of the initiative, and the source said that they plan to be a resource where needed and vice versa. But, the source said, this wasn\u2019t a directive from the Trump campaign. Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, argued Black voters and other minorities are turning to the GOP because of the contrast between the Trump years and the Biden administration, which he deems a failure on the economy, the border and crime. \u201cA lot of reasons why the shift is becoming just so blatantly obvious that it\u2019s now undeniable that there is something amiss,\u201d Scott said at a briefing this week with reporters in Washington, DC. \u201cIt\u2019s not just racial, but it\u2019s going to manifest itself in a racial shift that we haven\u2019t seen in probably three decades of politics.\u201d \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t had before was a recent president on the right vs. the current president on the left. And that translates into a lot of ticked off people who are looking at the Republican Party,\u201d he said. Scott says working class Americans and African American men in particular are wide open for a political shift. He\u2019ll tout what he characterizes as wins under the Trump administration, like forgiving debt for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Central to his argument is that many Black voters are faith oriented and culturally conservative and they are not voting in alignment with their social values by continuing to support Democrats. Scott believes this message will resonate in places like Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Detroit \u2013 all major cities in key battleground states. The senator also stressed the importance of showing up in places where Republicans aren\u2019t typically welcome. Trump recently had a campaign event in the Bronx, a county that voted overwhelmingly for Biden over Trump in 2020, according to CNN\u2019s election results. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about this for years that we have to go where we\u2019re not invited,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe have just not had enough candidates doing that from the party, and now we do, and we\u2019re gonna see the results that are consistent with that.\u201d This effort from Scott comes at a time when the Biden campaign sees cracks in their support from Black voters. A New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states released in May found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in CNN\u2019s exit poll. In the same survey, 14% of Black voters said that if the election were held today, they would vote for Trump vs. 49% for Biden. Hispanic voters were 31% for Biden and 31% for Trump. When it comes to non-White voters without a college degree, 32% said they would vote for Biden if the election were held today while 27% said they would back Trump. While 69% said there is \u201cnot really any chance\u201d they would vote for Trump, 24% of Black voters in the poll said there is \u201cnot really any chance\u201d they would cast their vote for Biden. Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika cast Scott\u2019s outreach as a \u201clast-ditch effort\u201d to defend Trump\u2019s \u201cracist agenda.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden is on the campaign trail showing up \u2013 himself \u2013 to earn, and not ask for, Black Americans\u2019 support. That is what leadership looks like,\u201d Chitika said in a statement. Just last week, the Biden campaign went to Philadelphia launching a nationwide effort to mobilize Black voters, characterizing the Trump campaign as one with a \u201cracist and toxic agenda.\u201d An April New York Times/Siena poll suggested that Biden\u2019s support continues to lag behind typical Democratic performance among several key subgroups within the party\u2019s usual coalition, with Black voters breaking 69% for Biden to 16% for Trump and Hispanic voters dividing 50% for Biden to 41% for Trump. Younger voters were split about evenly, 46% for Biden to 45% for Trump. Scott is making the case that there are voters up for grabs, and in a tight election, it could make the difference if they turn out for Trump, rather than coming home to Biden or not voting at all. Scott also said that he thinks that Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony charges is helping drive \u201cmore folks to the Republican Party period.\u201d He suggested that the conviction, which he told Fox News is unifying the Republican Party, has the potential to pull more Black men into the fold. \u201cI think African American men, specifically, have experienced a lot with the justice system, not all of the good, and therefore, watching an injustice play out that is just so blatant, a lot of African American men have said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m gonna take a closer look at the Republican Party,\u2019\u201d Scott said. Trump recently suggested something similar in February at a gathering of Black conservatives in South Carolina ahead of the state\u2019s Republican primary. \u201cA lot of people said that that\u2019s why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I\u2019m being discriminated against,\u201d Trump said. Separate from Trump, the Great Opportunity PAC sees this opportunity to close the gap with voters who feel like Democrats let them down. As CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak reported last week, Biden\u2019s aides say they aren\u2019t taking Black voters for granted as surveys suggest an erosion of support, particularly among Black men. \u201cThey feel like their vote has been taken for granted,\u201d Jennifer DeCasper, executive director of the Great Opportunity PAC said, referring to Black and brown Democrats.\u00a0\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to jump on the Republican bandwagon anytime soon. But I do feel like now we are on a level playing field where we can also compete for their votes and compete for their ears, and I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s happened in a really long time.\u201d \u201cWe are in a position where we want to step into that space, step in pretty heavy handed and show that we have not only the right policy, but we actually care about winning their vote and keeping their vote,\u201d DeCasper said.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_trump-campaign-trail-conviction", "text": "During his decades in the public eye, Donald Trump has stood before crowds as a builder of skyscrapers and casinos, a best-selling author, a reality television host, a husband and father, a New Yorker and Floridian, and a current and former president of the United States. On Thursday, he addressed an audience for the first time with his newest moniker: Felon. Trump spoke at a town hall in Phoenix, marking his first campaign appearance since a Manhattan jury last week convicted the presumptive Republican nominee on 34 counts related to a scheme to pay off a porn star ahead of the 2016 election \u2014 in a trial that he falsely referred to as \u201crigged\u201d on Thursday. Trump next heads to California for a fundraising swing \u2014\u00a0including a San Francisco event Thursday night hosted by two prominent tech venture capitalists, David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, two sources familiar with the event told CNN, that\u2019s expected to raise roughly $12 million, one of the sources said. The former president holds a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday, his first since the verdict. The flurry of events signals a new phase of the campaign for Trump with his New York case now largely behind him. No longer tethered to a Manhattan courtroom during the week, Trump is expected to ramp up his activity as he pivots from the trial to the trail. But as he steps back onto the campaign trail as a convicted felon, the urgency for Trump has crystalized. Now staring down a sentence in the hush money case, his best ticket to avoid more serious charges in the three other indictments he faces is convincing Americans to put him in office again. Trump\u2019s allies have responded to the unprecedented moment with escalating calls for retribution \u2013 both in the immediate aftermath of his conviction and if he recaptures the White House. Trump himself has also threatened his political opponents, continuing the retaliatory rhetoric that has permeated from his campaign since the onset. \u201cWell revenge does take time, I will say that, and sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest,\u201d the former president said in a interview with TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw that aired Thursday. \u201cYou know, sometimes it can.\u201d It\u2019s a tone he\u2019s struck throughout the week responding to his conviction. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible precedent for our country,\u201d Trump said during an interview with Newsmax that aired Tuesday. \u201cDoes that mean the next president does it to them? That\u2019s really the question.\u201d Trump had already galvanized his supporters around his legal troubles long before last week\u2019s verdict. His rallies had become a space for Trump to riff on his multiple indictments, test the boundaries of gag orders, attack the justice system and cast himself as a victim in a conspiratorial plot to keep him from the White House. His campaign believes that messaging has braced the Republican base for this outcome \u2013 and it isn\u2019t expected to stop. His supporters have responded with an unprecedented wave of donations that flooded the Trump campaign\u2019s coffers with $53 million online in the 24 hours after his conviction, his advisers said, and the fundraising appeals centered on his convictions have continued. In text messages Saturday to supporters, Trump\u2019s campaign sent a link to donate and wrote, \u201cI\u2019m still standing. 34 rigged felony convictions can\u2019t keep me down.\u201d Still, Trump can\u2019t soon move out from under the lasting cloud of his felonies nor the uncertainty it has cast over his third White House bid. Chief among the unknowns is how the broader electorate will respond to the first criminal conviction of a former US president. The event in Arizona \u2014 from which 11 people were transported to hospitals after reports of heat exhaustion, according to the Phoenix Fire Department \u2014 was hosted by the conservative group Turning Point Action. Trump\u2019s arrival put him in a state where undecided voters could determine his fate and comes days after President Joe Biden\u2019s latest action to secure the border \u2013 an issue the former president has used to hammer the Democrat with each passing surge of migrant crossings. Biden on Tuesday announced an executive action giving him authority to effectively shut down the US-Mexico border to asylum seekers entering illegally when a daily threshold of crossings is exceeded. Biden and his allies have framed his new policy as moving in the face of Republican inaction, noting that Trump helped kill a bipartisan Senate deal to unleash new resources toward securing the border. \u201cThe American people demand solutions to fix our broken immigration system, but at every step of the way, Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans have made clear they only want chaos and partisan politics as usual,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement Tuesday. Trump used the opportunity in Arizona to deliver an extended response to Biden\u2019s asylum action, vowing to rescind it on his first day in office if he wins in November. \u201cJoe Biden wants an invasion. I want a deportation,\u201d Trump said, baselessly calling Biden\u2019s policy \u201cpro-invasion\u201d and \u201cpro-child trafficking.\u201d Much of his prepared remarks focused on immigration \u2014 and he even invited controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whom he pardoned in 2017, on stage with him \u2014 although the event was clearly intended to rally Trump\u2019s base around his recent conviction as well. \u201cPresident Trump has proven time and again that he is an absolute force of nature that the left fears more than any other,\u201d Turning Point Action founder and Trump ally Charlie Kirk said in a statement announcing the town hall. \u201cThey know Joe Biden can\u2019t beat him in a fair fight, so they\u2019ve disgracefully weaponized the justice system.\u201d The Trump campaign, though, was not concerned Trump will muddy the message on immigration by focusing on his legal battles. Trump \u201ccan walk and chew gum,\u201d a source with knowledge of his remarks told CNN prior to the rally. \ufeffThis story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_us-pier-gaza-resume-operations", "text": "The US military\u2019s temporary pier off the coast of Gaza\u00a0was\u00a0repaired and\u00a0reattached to the beach on Friday morning, after\u00a0breaking apart and\u00a0sustaining damage\u00a0in heavy seas\u00a0last week, the deputy commander of US Central Command said on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to announce that earlier this morning, in Gaza, US forces successfully attached the temporary pier to the Gaza beach. Israeli Defense Force engineers provided all the necessary support to ensure the safe emplacement of the pier to the beach,\u201d Vice Adm. Brad Cooper told reporters on Friday. \u201cThe policy of no US boots on the ground does remain in effect. We expect to resume delivery of humanitarian assistance from the sea in the coming days.\u201d Earlier on Friday, a US defense official said the pier,\u00a0which was constructed by the US military\u00a0to transport aid\u00a0into Gaza,\u00a0is expected to resume\u00a0operations as soon as Friday with aid distribution resuming within the next day assuming all goes to plan. \u201cWe anticipate that our goal will be to deliver 500,000 pounds over the beach initially and then ramp that up soon thereafter,\u201d Cooper added. A USAID spokesperson said Friday that the agency \u201cremains in close contact with our colleagues from across the US government and humanitarian partners on the ground to ensure that aid can safely and effectively resume movement, which we expect in the coming days.\u201d The pier broke apart and sustained damage in heavy seas\u00a0last week in a major blow to the American-led effort to create a maritime corridor for humanitarian supplies into the war-torn enclave. The pier\u00a0is the result of\u00a0months of work by US officials trying to come up with a way to get aid into Gaza in addition to\u00a0dropping it out of planes or trucking it through border checkpoints Even\u00a0though\u00a0it was operational for only about a week, the pier helped deliver some 1,000 metric tons of aid into Gaza before breaking apart. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0to operate. It was anticipated to cost roughly $320 million and had only begun operating on May 17; officials have since said the cost is now closer to $230 million. Cooper emphasized Friday that the damage to the pier stemmed \u201csolely from unanticipated weather,\u201d and that the military will continue to look at the weather closely going forward. The JLOTS system consists of two parts: the floating pier where shipments will be offloaded and the causeway to transfer the shipments to the distribution point in Gaza. The damage last week came after significant obstacles on distribution routes including Hamas drones and looting that delayed the deliveries. As a result, the US\u00a0military\u00a0had to help USAID come up with alternative, safer routes for trucks leaving the marshaling area on the beach near the pier and traveling to the warehouses. Before then, the US had faced\u00a0a number of challenges\u00a0with the pier, including planning around Israel\u2019s operations in Rafah; establishing who would transport the aid from the pier into Gaza; and logistical challenges such as sea and weather conditions. The pier\u2019s construction came as the humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorates and the death toll from Israel\u2019s bombardment climbs. In Gaza, the entire population has faced food insecurity. The US has made a number of air drops of humanitarian aid into Gaza in partnership with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, though they were suspended in recent weeks due to military operations in the north of Gaza, Cooper said Friday. Air drops are expected to resume \u201cin the coming days,\u201d he said. The USAID spokesperson said the maritime corridor is \u201cjust one of several entry points for life-saving aid arriving into Gaza, including critical land crossings.\u201d \u201cWe continue to push for all entry points into Gaza to remain predictably functional at maximum capacity, and that internal access be improved so that aid can reach people in desperate need,\u201d the spokesperson said. Along with food, Chris Mewett, the\u00a0deputy assistant secretary of defense for global partnerships,\u00a0told reporters Friday that there are other forms of aid being delivered over the pier. \u201cI think everyone recognizes that food is just one component \u2014 shelter, medical care, etc.,\u201d Mewett said. US officials previously told CNN the US military is likely to operate the pier for at least three months, but the ultimate goal is to turn it into a full-time commercial operation that can be used by other countries and non-governmental organizations.

{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-bali", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas on Friday formally disclosed a 2019 trip to Indonesia paid for by GOP megadonor Harlan Crow, a vacation that was at the center of the controversy over his travel. The trip to Bali was the focus of the original report in ProPublica last year that triggered months of headlines about posh travel accepted by justices. Though the news organization\u2019s reporting raised awareness of the trip, Thomas did not formally disclose it on his previous reports. Thomas\u2019 annual financial disclosure, which would typically disclose travel, gifts and outside income for the prior year, included a note at the end listing Harlan and Kathy Crow as the source of a trip to Bali in July 2019. The couple paid for \u201cfood and lodging,\u201d according to the report. Thomas did not place a value on the travel. Thomas also reported a trip paid for by the Crows to a private club in Monte Rio, California, that same month. The annual disclosures, which are required by law, provide only a rough sketch of the finances of the justices and lower court judges. But the reports have drawn considerable attention in recent years amid a series of ethics scandals involving private jet travel and luxury vacations accepted by some of the justices as well as lucrative book deals. Much of that attention has focused on two members of the conservative wing, Thomas and Samuel Alito. Thomas has come under fire for a series of trips he accepted from Crow. Alito drew fire for attending a\u00a0luxury fishing trip\u00a0on the private jet of a conservative hedge fund manager. Most of that travel was not initially disclosed. As in past years, Alito received a 90-day extension on his report. The governing body of the judicial branch announced last year that it had tightened the rules. Previously, justices could withhold disclosing certain trips \u2013 including private jet travel \u2013 by claiming they were extended as \u201cpersonal hospitality.\u201d Thomas, specifically, explained the travel as \u201cpersonal hospitality\u201d from \u201cclose personal friends.\u201d Justices and judges must make a \u201cgood faith estimate of the fair market value\u201d of that travel if the exact value can\u2019t easily be obtained. The reports, which cover the 2023 calendar year, are also the first to land since the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for the first time in its history last fall. That code, which also came as a response to the travel scandals, was embraced by all nine justices.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_rfk-jr-election-president", "text": "Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is perhaps the biggest X factor remaining in the presidential race. If the current polling matches the final result, Kennedy \u2013 a onetime Democrat who tends to be better liked by Republicans \u2013 would earn the second-highest vote share of any independent or third-party White House candidate in the past half-century. But can Kennedy defy the usual gravity of politics that drags down most non-major party hopefuls as the election approaches? There are already some signs that his support may have already peaked. Now, Kennedy, at this point, is still pulling a substantial portion of the vote. He scored 14% and 17% in May polls conducted by Quinnipiac University and Marquette University Law School respectively. That\u2019s better than any third-party or independent candidate has polled in an individual survey at this stage in the cycle since Ross Perot in 1996. It\u2019s that high level of support that has caused both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to go after Kennedy. Trump is likely reading the polls that show Kennedy is slightly more likely to pull from voters who say they would be more inclined to vote for the former president. Biden is likely aware that Kennedy voters tend to skew younger \u2013 a demographic that traditionally leans Democratic. The attacks leveled on Kennedy seem like they may be having an effect. Take a look at polls conducted by Fox News, Quinnipiac and Reuters/Ipsos. All have trend lines dating back to late last year. In these three polls, Kennedy\u2019s support has dipped by an average of 5 points from their first survey to their most recent. Fox News has him going from 15% to 11%; Quinnipiac has him going from 17% to 14% (in a ballot test that includes Green Party candidate Jill Stein); Reuters/Ipsos shows him dropping from 17% to 10% among registered voters. This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t find a poll that has Kennedy doing slightly better than he was a few months ago (see Marquette). But the long-term trend line for Kennedy is not positive. Perhaps more concerning for the independent candidate is what\u2019s going on under the hood. His declining support isn\u2019t just a matter of voters now believing that backing anyone who isn\u2019t a Democrat or Republican would be a wasted vote. This is a matter of Kennedy himself becoming less liked. Take two polls that asked about Kennedy after he declared his independent candidacy in 2023 and then last month. His unfavorable rating in May\u2019s Quinnipiac poll jumped to 43% among voters, his highest on record. Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating dropped to 25%, just one point above his all-time low in the Quinnipiac poll. His net favorability was minus-18 points. He\u2019d previously never had a net negative favorable rating in the double digits. Kennedy, for almost the entire campaign, had considerably higher net favorability than either Biden or Trump. This was reversed in the latest Quinnipiac poll. Marquette\u2019s polling showed a somewhat similar trend. In November, Kennedy had a 38% favorable and 38% unfavorable rating. Today, he\u2019s at a 31% favorable and 45% unfavorable rating \u2013 his worst to date. (Marquette found Kennedy with a net favorable rating of +8 points during the primary season in February, when his unfavorable rating dipped to 32%.) Both Marquette and Quinnipiac continue to show that Kennedy is better liked by Republicans than Democrats. But even there, Kennedy has seen a clear decline in popularity. From April to May, Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating went from 44% among Republican voters to 31% in Quinnipiac\u2019s polling. His unfavorable rating climbed from 20% to 30%. The dip in Kennedy\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t the biggest surprise. The last time Trump faced off against an unpopular Democrat (Hillary Clinton in 2016), Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson looked like he could become the first independent or third-party candidate since Perot to take at least 5% of the presidential popular vote. Johnson ended up fading down the stretch, getting a little bit more than 3%. That was still the highest percentage for a non-major presidential candidate since Perot in 1996. This year, Kennedy is consistently polling higher than Johnson was in 2016. But Johnson had access to the Libertarian ballot line and was on the ballot in all 50 states. Kennedy, however, is currently nowhere near securing official ballot access in all 50 states. So all these national polls that indicate high levels of support for Kennedy aren\u2019t telling the full story if he won\u2019t be an option on many voters\u2019 ballots. Of course, this election isn\u2019t going to be won through the national popular vote. It will be won state-by-state through the Electoral College. How many ballots Kennedy gets on in the six closest states that Biden won in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) will ultimately be what determines his role in this election. Getting on the ballot isn\u2019t always easy for an independent, as Kennedy has learned in his ballot battle with Nevada. Still, this election is expected to be a close one, especially in the northern battleground states. Any share of the vote that Kennedy takes away from Biden or Trump could end up being crucial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/rfk-jr-election-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-progressives-immigration", "text": "Joe Biden is pushing progressives who are already sour on his presidency to the limit with a tough new executive action barring most asylum applications from migrants crossing the US-Mexico border illegally. But the president\u2019s weakness on one of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest campaign issues means it\u2019s a risk that he has no option but to take. People familiar with Biden\u2019s strategy pointed out privately that he was in the position of taking bold action on immigration after Republicans in Congress refused to act after killing a bipartisan immigration bill to please their presumptive nominee. If Biden wins November\u2019s election, it will probably be because he was able to cement the most disaffected liberal Democrats behind him, while appealing to moderates and dissenting Republicans who reject Trump\u2019s extremism. Many of the latter group feel that the border crisis is a matter of urgent national security, and Biden needs to show he takes the presidential duty of securing the homeland seriously. But the president has been on dicey ground with his party\u2019s most liberal members for months, and his standing with progressives has weakened dangerously over his support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks. The party schism will be on graphic display when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses Congress in the coming weeks \u2014 honoring an invitation that originated with Republicans keen to maximize Biden\u2019s political distress. The president\u2019s dilemma is so significant because of signs that the coalition that carried him to power over Trump four years ago has eroded. His support in polling compared to his performance four years ago has been especially shaky among liberal voters and people of color. In a knife-edge election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, every Democrat who doesn\u2019t show up for Biden is effectively a vote for his rival. The election may well turn on another Biden vulnerability \u2014 high prices and interest rates \u2014 or it could be decided by his warnings that Trump is unfit for office and a danger to democracy. But polls show voters are increasingly concerned about immigration. Of all issues tested, Biden recorded his lowest approval rating on immigration in a CNN poll in February \u2014 just 30%. Loud dissent from progressives on Biden\u2019s immigration moves The executive action, which is designed to alleviate the pressure on a hopelessly swamped asylum system, differs in important ways from the draconian policies of Trump \u2014 a point Biden was at pains to stress on Tuesday by emphasizing that he\u2019s not sending the military to lock people up before mass deportations, as the former president has said he plans to do. The Biden measure includes exceptions for unaccompanied minors and people who are deemed to be victims of a \u201csevere form\u201d of human trafficking. And the restrictions can be lifted if migrant arrivals fall well below current levels. But the act of wielding executive power to thwart any asylum applications strikes many progressives as a betrayal of liberal values, morally repugnant and counter to the country\u2019s historic mission. Biden addressed those Democrats directly on Tuesday at the White House. \u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you \u2026\u00a0 be patient \u2026 (the) good will of the American people \u2026 is wearing thin right now,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing nothing is not an option.\u00a0We have to act.\u201d Progressives are not just angry that the president\u2019s actions curtail asylum rights for desperate migrants fleeing repression, economic blight, trafficking, gang violence and other forms of political and social intimidation in South and Central America. The fear is that Biden\u2019s position will be the new orthodoxy for Democratic immigration initiatives going forward. These Democratic critics also despair that there\u2019s no path to citizenship for millions of migrants already in the country \u2014 including those brought to the US as children who are in limbo with no legal status. \u201cOnce again, no relief for Dreamers, farmworkers,\u201d Sen. Alex Padilla told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju.\u00a0Asked whether Biden could be hurt with progressive and Hispanic voters, the California Democrat replied: \u201cI guess there\u2019s still time for him to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Biden points out that he\u2019d rather act with Congress and that Republicans refused to pass the most conservative immigration bill in decades that would have paid for extra border patrol officers and poured resources into the stretched asylum system. But even that measure was stripped of many of the measures that Democrats traditionally seek to include in comprehensive immigration plans. Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Pramila Jayapal voiced a complaint shared by many liberals that Biden can\u2019t win votes by trying to match the Republican Party\u2019s march to the right. \u201cWe are making the same mistake again that Democrats continually make when we try to out-Republican the Republicans; it does not work,\u201d the Washington state Democrat said. Texas Rep. Greg Casar said Republicans \u201ctry to cover up their failures for this country by scapegoating immigrants and by trying to point to the border and to immigrants as the source of all of our problems,\u201d adding that it is \u201cunfortunate that President Biden is responding to those politics\u201d with this action. Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley added: \u201cWith all due respect Mr. President, we should not be unearthing policies from the last administration.\u201d Any president who disappoints his own supporters is in a perilous place when seeking reelection. Biden has shown throughout his term that he is conscious that the grassroots of his party is shifting left. He\u2019s granted billions of dollars in student loan relief \u2014 despite his efforts being thwarted by the courts and blasted by Republicans as illegal. He\u2019s tried to revive US manufacturing with hundreds of millions of dollars in public spending in his bipartisan infrastructure plan. And he\u2019s passed the most significant climate change legislation in America history, even if the measures fell short of what progressives had initially hoped for. Biden has also courted key figures on the progressive left, including Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran against him in the 2020 Democratic primary. Progressives face their own dilemma Biden would never say it bluntly in public, but his gamble with progressives carries an implicit question \u2014 where else are they going to go? Will they instead vote for a Republican demagogue who borrowed Adolf Hitler\u2019s language while warning that immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country? Will progressives and Arab Americans really stay home in the key swing state of Michigan and give an opening to a former president who called for a Muslim ban? This is a risky proposition for Biden, and some Democrats privately fear that the deaths of thousands of Palestinians in Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza could be the kind of burning single moral issue that could depress significant votes in Michigan. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who represents the battleground state\u2019s 12th Congressional District, got a lot of attention last month when she warned that there would be a price to pay for Biden and other Democrats who she said smeared pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to forget in November are we?\u201d Tlaib said. The congresswoman\u2019s remarks followed a campaign in the Michigan Democratic presidential primary that led more than 100,000 people to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d because of Biden\u2019s support for Israel. The protests did not come with a commitment for voters to desert the president in November, and Trump, obviously, was not on the ballot. But anything like that loss of Democratic votes could spell big trouble for Biden in the general election. Still, Biden\u2019s comeback after a terrible start in the 2020 primary is a reminder that the loudest progressive voices do not necessarily represent the critical center of a party. Biden did especially well with moderate and Black voters, especially women, whose views may resonate as much as those of frequently quoted progressive leaders in Washington. And there are some scenarios in which being rebuked by voters like Tlaib may help Biden with the voters he most needs to beat Trump in November. \u201cBroadly speaking, for her to attack Joe Biden in this way probably helps him politically,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden White House communications director, said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d last month. \u201cI think the majority of voters he\u2019s trying to win over, frankly the majority of voters in this country, are, broadly speaking, supportive of Israel, want to see us stand by our ally there. And I think if someone who is representing the farthest left of the party \u2026 if she\u2019s attacking Joe Biden, that probably helps him with the voters that he needs.\u201d One vital slice of the electorate the Biden campaign would love to impress are the Republican voters who chose former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley over Trump even months after she suspended her presidential primary campaign. Some Haley supporters on Tuesday welcomed Biden\u2019s immigration actions, CNN\u2019s Kit Maher reported. \u201cWhile many Haley voters continue to have policy differences, this common-sense action is a clear step in the right direction to address one of the top priorities of many Haley voters,\u201d the Haley Voters Working Group, a coalition of approximately 25 conservative Haley supporters, posted on X. The group is far too small to be representative. But expanding tiny seams of potential support is the critical work of grassroots campaigning in very tight elections. A Biden campaign official met with the group for a Zoom call last month. Amanda Stewart Sprowls, a Haley supporter from Arizona, told CNN Biden\u2019s actions on Tuesday were a \u201cshow of good faith\u201d and added: \u201cThey\u2019re starting to listen to the center.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-progressives-immigration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fascism-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "This week, Americans and Europeans celebrated the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces invaded occupied France, marking the beginning of the end of fascist power in Europe. Last week, after being found guilty of falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump said Americans today live in a \u201cfascist state,\u201d building on his unfounded conspiracy theory that somehow President Joe Biden is behind his prosecution in Manhattan. It was an ironic turn of phrase for Trump since, throughout his rise, academics and pundits have debated whether his cult-of-personality politics veers toward a form of fascism. But flipping the script on his critics is a specialty of the former president. Robert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University who has written widely on fascism in Europe, had rejected the label for Trump until January 6, 2021, when the historian argued that the image of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol \u201cremoves my objection to the fascist label.\u201d Trump\u2019s use of certain terms has forced comparisons The debate over whether Trump veers toward fascism was renewed multiple times this year after Trump\u2019s committed followers swatted away a field of qualified challengers for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump has repeatedly used language that can be tied back to Nazis, such as when he said immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country. Last month, his campaign amplified and then deleted a supporter\u2019s video that promised a \u201cunified Reich\u201d if he wins reelection. The New York University historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat took a close look at all of the images presented in that video and concluded for CNN Opinion that the video was \u201creminiscent of the fascist propaganda I have studied for\u00a0many years.\u201d With a charismatic leader, a nationalist outlook built around fear of immigrants and a sense of grievance built around his 2020 election loss, there are certainly some ingredients of fascism in the current version of Trump\u2019s campaign. Supporters have a plan to use a second Trump term to gut portions of the civil service, supposedly to remake a government that will more easily bend to his will. His sense of persecution at facing criminal charges adds more grist. Trump has consistently teased the idea that he will repay his political rival, Biden, for his conviction. The Trump-supporting Fox News host Sean Hannity tried repeatedly on Wednesday to get Trump to rule out using the Department of Justice as an arm for vengeance, but Trump rambled around the questions. \u201cIt has to stop, because otherwise we\u2019re not going to have a country,\u201d Trump said, suggesting he would not weaponize the Justice Department. But he then said he would be fully within his rights to prosecute his political opponents.  \u201cLook, when this election is over, based on what they\u2019ve done, I would have every right to go after them, and it would be easy because it\u2019s Joe Biden,\u201d the former president said. That\u2019s less definitive than the social media post last year when Trump verifiably promised, if he wins, to appoint a special counsel to \u201cgo after\u201d Biden, but it\u2019s certainly not a hard no. \u2018I don\u2019t care what you call this\u2019 When CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance about Trump\u2019s claim the US is a \u201cfascist state,\u201d Vance, who CNN has reported is being vetted as a potential Trump running mate, would not reject the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love,\u201d Vance said in a tense exchange. Watch it: A warning from McConnell There are comparisons between current times and the rise of fascism everywhere at the moment, even when they are not focused directly on Trump. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times commemorating D-Day titled, \u201cWe cannot repeat the mistakes of the 1930s.\u201d It doesn\u2019t mention Trump. McConnell will step aside from his Senate GOP leadership position in November in part because his party has moved away from the arsenal-of-democracy view of American power embraced by McConnell and other old-school Republicans and toward an isolationist, Vladimir Putin-friendly view of foreign policy pushed by Trump. Arguing that we rightly celebrate D-Day soldiers, McConnell argued we often forget why those service members needed to fight in the first place. \u201cWe forget how influential isolationists persuaded millions of Americans that the fate of allies and partners mattered little to our own security and prosperity,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cWe gloss over the powerful political forces that downplayed growing danger, resisted providing assistance to allies and partners, and tried to limit America\u2019s ability to defend its national interests.\u201d I talked to Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and editor of the new book, \u201cDid It Happen Here? Perspectives on Fascism and America,\u201d which includes the writing of Paxton, among many others. \u201cThat model of historical comparison where we look to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and then use it as kind of a navigational device or a map for understanding what\u2019s happened today is quite common,\u201d he said, although there are arguments it is a flawed comparison. \u201cConcepts don\u2019t have timeless essences that we can just map on to any phenomena, but they change given political context, given power structures in society,\u201d he said. Today, he said, the term \u201cfascism\u201d is used \u201cto mobilize people in order to get over their divides, to defeat an enemy that\u2019s far greater than their own long-standing disputes.\u201d Steinmetz-Jenkins argued there is a long history, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, of Americans on both sides of the political aisle trying to label their opponents as \u201cfascist,\u201d and there are also examples of American lawmakers threatening their opponents with investigation. There are arguments in favor of the fascism comparison, but also arguments against it \u2013 particularly since there are echoes of Trump\u2019s rise in populist and White nationalist movements closer to home in American history. Directly comparing eras can backfire For instance, Rep. Byron Donalds, a Black Republican from Florida and another potential Trump running mate, has had to explain his argument that American social programs have driven Black families apart and that they were more cohesive at a time of legalized racial terror under Jim Crow laws in the US, which were a model for Nazis. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said in comments first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer. He tried to explain that comment to CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on Wednesday, arguing he was not expressing nostalgia for the Jim Crow era, but rather trying to argue that during that period, marriage rates were higher. It was a complicated argument for him to make, to say the least. Donalds tried to argue that the ideological divide in today\u2019s political parties should be applied to perceptions of that era, when some Southern Democrats opposed civil rights legislation and some Northern Republicans supported it. Today, the parties are even more regionally divided, with Democrats largely out of power in the South and Republicans largely out of power in the North. The parties realigned around conservative and liberal ideologies \u2013 a process that continues to happen today as Republicans reorient around Trumpism.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fascism-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_capitol-police-jan-6-pennsylvania-house", "text": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (AP) \u2014 A visit to the Pennsylvania House floor by two former police officers who helped protect the US Capitol during the January 6 riot of 2021 drew boos and walkouts by some Republican legislators this week. Witnesses said the appearance Wednesday by former US Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn and his ex-boss, former Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, triggered a distinctly negative response from some Republicans, with someone even shouting that they were cowards. House Speaker Joanna McClinton, a Philadelphia Democrat, who welcomed Gonell and Dunn to the floor, called the GOP reaction to the former officers disrespectful. She said in a statement that many Republican members walked off the floor, turned their backs and booed. \u201cThe GOP members\u2019 shameful behavior was unbecoming of our institution for any guest, let alone two of the men responsible for defending our democracy during a dark day in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d McClinton said. \u201dThe Republicans\u2019 disrespect, lack of patriotism and even common decency, epitomizes the poor behavior that so many in the MAGA movement have adopted.\u201d In a text on Thursday, Dunn said he heard a commotion but could not make out what was being said. He thanked Republican Minority Leader Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County for taking a photo with them. Dunn said he was \u201chonored to be there being recognized.\u201d The two had made an appearance a few hours earlier Wednesday on the steps of the Pennsylvania Capitol at an event coordinated by the campaign of President Joe Biden. Video from the scene in the chamber as business was wrapping up for the week showed several Republican members and staff, including Cutler, applauding the officers. Cutler later noted House Democrats sent out a fundraising email immediately afterward. \u201cThe truth is, I support law enforcement. I spoke to the gentlemen about the job they performed,\u201d Cutler told reporters Wednesday afternoon. \u201cAnd I think that when you look at it, I\u2019m tired of the House speaker using the guest list and the legislative calendar for political purposes.\u201d The House Democratic Campaign Committee solicitation said \u201cHouse Republicans couldn\u2019t leave the floor fast enough in protest\u201d and asked for contributions \u201cto help us defend our democracy\u201d and keep their House majority. At the Biden campaign event earlier on the state Capitol steps, Dunn and Gonell were flanked by more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers. The two warned at the appearance that they see former president and current GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump as a danger to democracy. \u201cDonald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today,\u201d Dunn told reporters. \u201cHe has encouraged and continues to encourage political violence. \u2026 His deranged, self-centered, obsessive quest for power is the reason violent insurrectionists assaulted me and my brave colleagues.\u201d Hundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours. Gonell said the\u00a0attackers assaulted him\u00a0repeatedly. He recounted how he was beaten, punched, kicked and hit with his own baton in the head. Someone tried to drag him into the mob and beat him with an American flag still attached to a flagpole, he said. Gonell said his injuries required two surgeries. \u201cDonald Trump called the people who injured me and attacked our Capitol hostages, patriots and political prisoners. If those people are those things, who are we?\u201d Gonnell said, adding that the officers on January 6 were defending elected officials from both parties \u201cregardless of their political ideology,\u201d Dunn, who is Black, has previously described how the crowd in the Capitol yelled racial slurs at him, something that never happened while he was on duty during more than a dozen years on the force. Rep. Mike Schlossberg, Democrat of Lehigh, said he witnessed his Republican colleagues\u2019 response on Wednesday and heard one member refer to Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police inside the Capitol during the rioting. He said he saw two Republican members walking out and that other Democrats reported that as many as 10 GOP House members did so. It was a notable contrast to the solemn respect that normally greets soldiers and police officers when they are recognized on the House floor, he said. The cheering that can be heard on a video of the House activity was a Democratic attempt to loudly cheer over the booing, Schlossberg said. \u201cIt was despicable and it was an embarrassment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the party that supposedly cherishes law and order.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/capitol-police-jan-6-pennsylvania-house/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_aileen-cannon-judge-trump-classified-documents", "text": "Judge Aileen Cannon had been on the federal bench for little more than a year when a senior judge offered to preside over one of her first criminal trials in her isolated south Florida courthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s very lonely,\u201d Senior Judge Paul C. Huck told CNN of Fort Pierce, a small fishing and citrus community on the edge of the Southern District of Florida where Cannon is the only federal judge. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty sleepy town with a pretty sleepy courtroom.\u201d Huck ultimately presided over the March 2022 criminal trial \u2013 not because Cannon needed help, he said, but because he enjoys volunteering for trials in courts across Florida. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go up there and just spend some time with her and get to know her better,\u201d\u00a0Huck said of Cannon, whom he recalled as \u201cvery smart\u201d and \u201cvery personable.\u201d Two years later, Cannon is now presiding over one of the most consequential and complex cases in America: the criminal prosecution of former president Donald Trump over his handling of the nation\u2019s secrets. And she\u2019s attracting nationwide scrutiny for how she\u2019s approached the case. Since Trump was first indicted a year ago, Cannon has dragged out the proceedings in ways that have flummoxed legal scholars and put a trial initially scheduled to begin last month on hold indefinitely. Several attorneys who have practiced in front of Cannon \u2013 and who spoke to CNN for this story \u2013 pointed to her isolation as one explanation for her conduct. Cannon\u2019s solitary post in the Fort Pierce courthouse, one that rarely sees high-profile action, deprives her of the informal, day-to-day interactions with more seasoned judges who sit at the other courthouses and could offer her advice, the lawyers told CNN. They also said Cannon\u2019s lack of trial experience, both as a lawyer and a judge, is apparent. In her seven years as a Justice Department attorney, Cannon participated on the trial teams of just four criminal cases. \u202fAnd on the bench, she\u2019s only presided over a handful of criminal trials \u2013 and Huck took over one of them. For this account of Cannon\u2019s judicial demeanor, CNN spoke to ten attorneys who have had cases \u2013 both criminal and civil \u2013 before her. The lawyers spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because of the professional and ethical risks of speaking to press about a sitting federal judge in front of whom they practice. To corroborate their characterizations of Cannon\u2019s approach, CNN reviewed the public dockets of scores of cases that have traveled through her courtroom. The attorneys described Cannon as extremely diligent and well prepared, a tough questioner who accepts nothing at face value, and thoughtful in her rulings. But they also said that some of her habits that have raised eyebrows in Trump\u2019s case have plagued her approach from the bench more generally. Those tendencies include a penchant for letting irrelevant legal questions distract from core issues, a zero-tolerance approach to any technical defects in filings, and a struggle with docket management that allows the type of pretrial disputes that other judges would decide in weeks go unresolved for months. \u201cShe is not efficient,\u201d said one attorney who practices in south Florida. \u201cShe is very form over substance.\u201d Another attorney described her as \u201cindecisive.\u201d A third attorney who\u2019s had cases before Cannon said, \u201cShe just seems overwhelmed by the process.\u201d \u2018You can\u2019t really take issue with her\u2019 Five months after Huck visited Cannon in Fort Pierce, she was thrust into the center of back-to-back legal hurricanes. First, she oversaw the lawsuit Trump brought challenging the FBI\u2019s search of his Mar-a-Lago residence that August, when agents found hundreds of classified documents scattered about the property. (Cannon granted Trump\u2019s request for a third-party review of the search, only to see her rulings reversed by a conservative appeals court.) Then, in a twist of fate last June, Cannon was assigned the criminal case in which Trump is charged with\u00a040\u00a0felony\u00a0counts\u00a0of allegedly mishandling classified documents and obstructing the government\u2019s attempts to find them. The high-profile national security case is a dramatic departure from most of the other criminal cases playing out in Cannon\u2019s courtroom, the bulk of which are more mundane prosecutions like gun charges or immigration infractions that are often resolved through guilty pleas, a CNN review of her case log showed. Cannon\u2019s assignment to the documents case was a game of odds. Though the charges were filed in West Palm Beach, the division that is home to Mar-a-Lago, Cannon was randomly chosen from a broader pool of judges in Florida\u2019s southern district. Her approach as a jurist \u2013 detail-obsessed to the point of tedious \u2013 appears uniquely prone to being exploited by a defense team eager to delay the case. And the complicated system Cannon has set up for redacting public filings has only exacerbated a backlog of unresolved issues. She still has not decided foundational questions that will determine whether the Trump case will go to trial. Marginal issues clutter her docket, including a longshot motion to invalidate Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel that she\u2019s scheduled a hearing on later this month. Some attorneys who have practiced before Cannon\u00a0chalked up her struggle handling the practical logistics of being a trial court judge to her background of mostly appellate work for the local US Attorney\u2019s office. \u202fThey described her as latching onto abstract, academic questions at the expense of the type of on-the-fly decision-making required by trial judges that keeps litigation moving along. As Cannon slowly plods through the backlog of issues on her plate, special counsel prosecutors are now learning firsthand the wrath that they can incur from the judge for seemingly minor discrepancies in their filings, and they have drawn Cannon\u2019s ire for pushing her to move more quickly to resolve the substantive pretrial issues that have slowed the pace of the case to a crawl. \u201cYou can\u2019t really take issue with her, otherwise it\u2019s going to work against you,\u201d a fourth attorney who has practiced before Cannon said. Trump\u2019s attorneys have also attracted heat from Cannon, though far less often than the special counsel. Defense attorneys CNN spoke to described Cannon as a judge who gives minimal deference to defendants and as a \u201cnotoriously\u201d tough sentencer. To that end, the long leash she\u2019s given the Trump team in the pretrial phase of the case has struck a chord with them. \u201cShe\u2019s certainly not sympathetic to most defendants, and she\u2019s certainly playing a different game with the current defendant before her,\u201d another lawyer told CNN, in reference to Trump. Nothing taken at face value Not every attorney who spoke to CNN about their experience in front of Cannon was critical. \u202fSome praised her for asking questions at hearings that showed she had done her research and said that she moved their cases along at a reasonable pace. Veterans of her courtroom broadly agreed on one aspect of Cannon\u2019s judicial approach: that lawyers should expect her to sharply probe any and all assertions made in her courtroom, no matter the party, with a resistance to taking anyone at their word. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like any litigant to tell her what she should be doing,\u201d one of the attorneys said. Many recalled her rejecting joint motions \u2013 such as sentencing recommendations or requests to delay proceedings \u2013 even though there was no dispute between the two sides. \u201cYou can\u2019t assume that just because there\u2019s agreement between the parties that she will go along,\u201d one of the attorneys said, while describing her as an \u201cincredibly hands on\u201d judge \u201cwho wants to be the decision-maker of everything.\u201d Criminal defense attorneys who practice in front of Cannon appreciate that, despite being\u00a0a former Justice Department attorney, she doesn\u2019t defer automatically to the assertions of prosecutors, cutting against the stereotype of judges always erring on the side of the government. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like the government to come in and play bully, steamroller,\u201d one of the attorneys said. In the Trump case, Cannon has repeatedly taken Smith\u2019s attorneys to task for using broad generalizations to back up their requests\u00a0\u2013 a practice that prosecutors can get away with in other courts \u2013 and demanding extreme specificity in whatever prosecutors are asking her for. Her intense scrutiny extends to whether attorneys are following granular procedural rules about how to file submissions to her court. Last month, such deficiencies prompted Cannon to rebuff a gag order request Smith filed after Trump falsely claimed the FBI had a plan to assassinate him during the Mar-a-Lago search. She did so because she found the prosecutors had run afoul of local rules requiring them to give the opposing side ample time to consult with them on the request. On other occasions in Trump\u2019s case, she has rejected even routine filings for minor technicalities. The practice is reflected in several court dockets reviewed by CNN, including at least two other examples where Cannon denied motions because she said lawyers failed to appropriately confer with one another. One of the attorneys who spoke to CNN described Cannon\u2019s approach to policing procedural rules as, \u201cI decide the way it\u2019s going to be, and if you don\u2019t want to do it the way I tell you, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Attorneys pointed out that she is not the only judge on the federal bench who gives no leeway for even the most minor of procedural errors, but some said that her fixation on technicalities led cases to get bogged down in minutiae. In the Trump case, it took nearly three months for several major pretrial motions to even be docketed after the cumbersome process of litigating what would be redacted in the public filings. Seven of those requests, which seek to throw out parts of the case, remain undecided, and oral arguments have been scheduled on only some so far. And Cannon still has to handle all the other cases playing out in the Fort Pierce division while she navigates the Trump case. Seizing on irrelevant concepts Cannon has repeatedly hauled the lawyers in Trump\u2019s case in for hearings on pretrial disputes in the classified documents case \u2013 several of which legal experts say appear tangential or even irrelevant. The Florida attorneys CNN spoke to acknowledged that it\u2019s understandable for a new judge to hold hearings on issues more experienced judges might be more comfortable in dealing with, and they did not fault her for being especially thorough in the incredibly high stakes Trump case. Still, Cannon has asked questions in the Trump case that appear out of left field. In March, for example, Cannon ordered attorneys to draft jury instructions that consider the Presidential Records Act, the federal law that requires an outgoing president to return government records to the National Archives at the end of their administration. Outside experts and the special counsel\u2019s office lambasted the request as both procedurally premature and legally unsound for how it entertained a fringe theory from the Trump team. Cannon testily defended the exercise as a \u201cgenuine attempt\u201d to understand the parties\u2019 positions. Her orientation toward such legal rabbit holes is not distinct to the Trump case, veterans of her courtroom say. \u201cShe seems to seize on concepts that for one reason or another become interesting to her whether or not they\u2019re pertinent to the case at hand \u2013 or decide that they have importance for reasons that escape the rest of the parties in the court room,\u201d one of the attorneys said. Her lack of trial experience before her appointment stands out among the other judges confirmed to the south Florida federal court under the Biden, Trump and Obama administrations \u2013 all of whom had either extensive trial experience as state court judges or had tried 10 or more cases as lawyers before their nomination to the federal bench.\u202fSome attorneys say they\u2019ve been concerned her decisions have made\u00a0 it more likely their cases would be appealed. One attorney told CNN that if he has a case that is assigned to Cannon, he asks the opposing party whether they\u2019d consent to allowing the cases to be handled by a magistrate judge, a type of judge that does not have all the power of US district judge but can handle some kinds of proceedings. Ultimately, nearly every attorney CNN spoke to said that Cannon, despite the criticism, is unwavering in her beliefs about how each case in her courtroom should proceed. As one attorney put it: \u201cShe thinks what she\u2019s doing is correct.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sara Murray contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/aileen-cannon-judge-trump-classified-documents/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Netanyahu\u2019s speech will arrive at a time when his relationship with President Joe Biden has become strained over Israel\u2019s war plans and efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Gaza. While Congress passed a bill with aid to Ukraine and Israel in April, Democrats remain divided over Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas. The top four congressional leaders \u2013 House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 signed on to a letter inviting Netanyahu on May 31. An Israeli official confirmed that Netanyahu will address Congress on July 24. The timing of the address was uncertain earlier this week, after an initial floated date of June 13 was ruled out because it fell on the Jewish holiday Shavuot. It also coincided with Biden\u2019s visit to Italy for a Group of 7 summit. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. It is not clear whether the prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington will include a meeting at the White House. Netanyahu has yet to publicly endorse an Israeli peace proposal laid out by Biden last week. Meanwhile, the US has grown frustrated by some of Israel\u2019s war tactics, which officials believe do not include stringent enough protections for civilians. The decision to invite Netanyahu was not met with unanimous approval among Democrats. Many in the party say the prime minister has become an obstacle to peace, and some members of Congress have vowed to boycott the speech. Schumer, a New York Democrat who called for new elections in Israel earlier this year, acknowledged in a Thursday night statement that he had \u201cclear and profound disagreements\u201d with Netanyahu, but he defended his decision to sign on to the letter. \u201cBecause America\u2019s relationship with Israel is ironclad and transcends one person or prime minister I joined the request for him to speak,\u201d he said.

The White House was forced into a fresh damage control effort Wednesday to defend the 81-year-old commander in chief\u2019s acuity as he embarked on a grueling foreign trip and as the race gets nastier by the day. The latest episode was sparked by a Wall Street Journal article that cited descriptions \u2013 disputed by the White House \u2013 of the president\u2019s state of mind and fitness from what it described as more than 45 interviews with both Democrats and Republicans. The president was depicted as speaking so softly in one meeting about Ukraine that he was almost unintelligible to some participants. Other sources questioned whether he was fully in command of key details of his own policies. Democrats accused Republicans quoted or referred to in the account of making false claims and contradicting previous statements to damage Biden politically. Washington Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, complained on X that her comments to the Journal about the president\u2019s strong engagement in a meeting on Ukraine in January were not used by the paper. Biden has managed to tamp down previous kerfuffles over his age and capabilities this year with a robust public performance at his State of the Union address in March. He so surpassed Republican expectations that some in the party absurdly flipped from portraying him as doddering and incompetent to suggesting he must be drugged up. But all it takes is one halting on-camera moment or media report to revive the frenzy over Biden\u2019s age. This was inevitable as soon as the president decided to run for a second term that would begin when he is 82 and would end when he\u2019s 86. Biden\u2019s team habitually dismisses any concern over his capacity, and his doctors have certified him fit for duty. Democrats often claim this is an issue hyped up by the media, while pointing out that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump isn\u2019t young either \u2013 he turns 78 next week. This particular Wall Street Journal article may be a Beltway drama that isn\u2019t occupying the minds of most voters. But they are concerned about Biden\u2019s age. And the question of the president\u2019s fitness for office is a legitimate one even if Republican efforts to portray him as weak and incoherent have obvious political motivations. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll in February, for instance, 86% of Americans thought Biden was too old to serve another term. That included 59% of Americans who thought both he and Trump were too old and 27% who thought only Biden was too old. Voters can also see it for themselves. The president has clearly slowed in office. He does often speak quietly and mangle his words more than he did even as a gaffe-prone senator and vice president. The job of commander in chief is one of the most exacting in the world, involves constant life-and-death decisions and comes with no genuine days off. Public speculation about the capacity of the president is also a highly sensitive issue \u2014 and is often indulged in by pundits with no medical expertise. Millions of Americans have some familiarity with the indignities of aging. That may offer Biden some sympathy, but it\u2019s also a reason why many have concerns about an octogenarian serving as commander in chief. Biden defiant about his capabilities Biden \u2014 who was one of the youngest senators in US history and is now its oldest sitting president \u2014 bristles when asked whether he\u2019s too old to be president, or would be late in his second term when he\u2019d reach his mid 80s. \u201cI can do it better than anybody you know.\u00a0You\u2019re looking at me, I can take you too,\u201d Biden quipped to a reporter in a recent Time Magazine interview. \u201cWatch me. Look, name me a president that\u2019s gotten as much done as I\u2019ve gotten done in my first three and a half years.\u201d Massimo Calabresi, Time\u2019s Washington bureau chief, said that during their meeting, Biden came across \u201cvery much as he appears on TV,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is older than when he started in office. It\u2019s visible if you just look side by side on the tape.\u201d In his story, Calabresi wrote: \u201cThe President, with his stiff gait, muffled voice, and fitful syntax, cut a striking contrast with the intense, loquacious figure who served as Senator and Vice President.\u201d The debate over Biden\u2019s age is rendered more complex since he\u2019s running against a 77-year-old. Trump might come across as more energetic than his successor, whom he\u2019s dubbed \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d but the former president himself often appeared to be snoozing during his criminal trial in New York. The campaign trail version of Trump raises other concerns \u2014 not least because of his volcanic demeanor and estrangement from the truth. But Trump, like Biden, has recently bungled names, misidentified people and offered nonsensical public comments. Asked about the Wall Street Journal report by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, Trump on Wednesday said, \u201cWe have a chance of going into World War III because of our leader. So I don\u2019t want to get into what state he\u2019s in,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not something for me to talk about.\u201d The former president went on to say Biden was not \u201cmentally sharp enough\u201d to do the job, before adding, \u201cand I don\u2019t believe he was 20 years ago, either.\u201d Fitness for office is often in the eye of the beholder. The Republicans who insist Biden is too diminished see no reason why a twice-impeached convicted felon who has echoed Nazi rhetoric and is promising to use presidential powers in a personal quest for \u201cretribution\u201d against his enemies should not return to the Oval Office. Biden is increasingly focusing on Trump\u2019s mental capacity. He has told audiences in fundraising events recently that \u201csomething snapped\u201d after Trump lost the 2020 election and that he\u2019s \u201cclearly unhinged.\u201d Has Biden slowed or is he \u2018savvy and effective\u2019? The Journal article, headlined \u201cBehind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,\u201d detailed anecdotes about the president\u2019s attentiveness in meetings. It said that Democrats and Republicans reported that he has slowed and that some of his engagement and energy fluctuated and that he had good days and bad days. The Journal noted, however, that most of those who were critical of Biden\u2019s performance were Republicans. The paper quoted former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not the same person.\u201d Current House Speaker Mike Johnson worried the president\u2019s memory \u201chad slipped about the details of his own policy,\u201d the Journal wrote, citing six people who had been told about the speaker\u2019s views. (The White House denied Biden had misspoken during that exchange.) Neither speaker is a disinterested observer. Both have vested political interests in playing into Trump\u2019s claims that Biden is too old or absent to serve. The White House responded to the Journal story by saying in a statement that \u201cCongressional Republicans, foreign leaders and nonpartisan national-security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment.\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates added: \u201cNow, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.\u201d There is no current public evidence that Biden is unable to carry out the most onerous duties of his job that include making vital decisions to ensure the country\u2019s national security, especially in emergencies and at times of crisis. Still, the public facing part of the presidency is also important. A fair-minded person cannot help but note that Biden is not the same dynamic room-filling force that he was for years. The break that Biden and his aides enjoyed from questions about his age after his barnstorming State of the Union address followed a previous age-related frenzy. Special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s February report into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents described him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and a transcript of the encounter showed Biden occasionally flustered and searching for dates. But the totality of the encounter doesn\u2019t support Republican claims of advanced cognitive decline. The report, however, was followed by a disastrous press appearance that served more to highlight questions of age than dampen them. \u201cI know what the Hell I am doing,\u201d the president said. But at one point, he compounded his problem when he meant to talk about the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said \u201cthe president of Mexico.\u201d On other occasions in February, Biden twice referred to dead European leaders \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl \u2013 when referring to conversations with their modern-day counterparts. Biden\u2019s stamina will be tested in the long haul to November\u2019s election. In the coming weeks, he has the kind of schedule that would exhaust anyone. He\u2019s due to return from France on Sunday, and is expected to fly to California for fundraising, before crossing the Atlantic again for the G7 summit in Italy next weekend. Even for someone with their own plane, it\u2019s a heavy lift at 81. Then he faces the most critical phase in his reelection campaign so far: his June 27 debate with Trump on CNN, which represents the most high-profile test of a sitting president\u2019s capabilities on live television since a much younger Ronald Reagan confronted similar questions in his 1984 reelection race. Presidents have great power. But even they cannot turn back the ravages of time. So it will not be long before Biden is once again called on to insist that he\u2019s not too old to serve.

From Trump on down,\u00a0members of the GOP\u00a0are launching furious plans to prosecute Democrats at every turn, especially if the man who lost the White House in 2020 can win it back this fall. Trump nodded to the idea when asked about his conviction, which he has persistently, and with no evidence, blamed on President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible path that they are leading us to,\u201d Trump said on the conservative channel Newsmax, \u201cand it\u2019s very possible that it\u2019s going to have to happen to them.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies have taken up that drumbeat with fury. \u201cI\u2019m quite frankly pissed off,\u201d Texas Republican\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Ronny Jackson told Newsmax. \u201cPresident Biden should be ready,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cbecause on January 20 of next year when he\u2019s former President Joe Biden \u2026 I\u2019m going to encourage all of my colleagues and everybody that I have any influence over as a member of Congress to aggressively go after the president and his entire family, his entire crime family, for all of the misdeeds that are out there right now.\u201d Seizing on the special counsel prosecution of Biden\u2019s son Hunter is clearly, for many of them, just a warm up. Less than a year ago, Trump vowed:\u00a0\u201cI will appoint a real special \u2018prosecutor\u2019 to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the USA, Joe Biden, the entire Biden crime family, & all others involved in the destruction of our elections, borders, & country itself!\u201d Calls for arrests, jail time\u00a0and\u00a0even worse have ricocheted throughout right-wing media with renewed intensity since a\u00a0New York jury delivered its\u00a0guilty verdict. Much of it is aimed at Biden, but there is plenty of anger to go around. Former Trump adviser and far-right firebrand, Steve Bannon, wants Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg jailed, and he suggested to the New York Times that Republican prosecutors coast-to-coast should start building cases against Democrats. \u201cThere are dozens of ambitious, backbencher state attorneys general and district attorneys who need to \u2018seize the day\u2019 and own this moment in history,\u201d Bannon said. Bannon faces trial himself this fall after being indicted by Bragg over allegations he defrauded donors through a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. He has pleaded not guilty. Another former Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, is sounding the same battle cry. \u201cEvery facet of Republican party politics and power has to be used right now to go toe-to-toe with Marxism and beat these communists!\u201d Miller said on Fox News this week as he ticked through an action agenda. \u201cIs every Republican AG opening investigations into voter fraud, right now? Is every House committee controlled by Republicans using its subpoena power in every way it needs to, right now? Is every Republican DA starting every investigation it needs to, right now?\u201d Speaker of the House\u00a0Mike Johnson has announced a \u201cthree-pronged approach\u201d to reining in the\u00a0US\u00a0Department of Justice, which has been repeatedly savaged by Trump. Johnson is promising to use appropriations, legislation and oversight to muzzle the department for, as he sees it, undermining American faith in the judicial process. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than just President Trump. It\u2019s bigger than just these cases. It\u2019s about our system itself, and because of that, there is a backlash,\u201d he said. It all dovetails with a massive plan of action being pushed by the Heritage Foundation should Trump be\u00a0reelected\u00a0\u2013 a plan that calls for the Department of Justice to be no longer treated as an independent body making decisions based on law. Under Project 2025, as it is called, the DOJ would come under \u201cthe direct supervision and control of the President,\u201d who would be free to determine who was charged for what, and to see that cases were \u201cmade consistent with the President\u2019s agenda.\u201d Some top Democrats have long predicted a wave of retribution should Trump win\u00a0reelection, especially for sharp critics of the now presumptive GOP nominee, journalists who highlight Trump\u2019s lies and misdeeds and for members of the January 6 select committee. Former congresswoman and the committee\u2019s vice chair\u00a0Liz Cheney has drawn special attention, with Trump earlier this year posting on his social media platform, \u201cShe should go to\u00a0Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!\u201d A raging sea of Republicans is now, without doubt, hoping to see that retribution brought to reality.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/republicans-revenge-tour-2024-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_ketanji-brown-jackson-beyonce-concert-tickets", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 gave Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson four tickets to her concert last year, the justice disclosed in financial disclosure forms published Friday that also revealed that Jackson and other justices received six-figure payments in 2023 for book deals. Jackson, who reported an eye-popping $893,750 payment from a book publisher, was joined by Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor in reporting income from books that they have published or have coming out in the future. The book deals have at times been controversial. Supreme Court justices and other government officials are capped on receiving more than about $30,000 in outside income, but book income doesn\u2019t count toward that cap. Jackson, a member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, was paid by Penguin Random House, the book publisher that is publishing her upcoming memoir. Kavanaugh, a conservative who recently disclosed he is writing a memoir, listed a $340,000 payment from the Javelin Group agency. Gorsuch, who is also publishing a book this year, reported royalty income of $250,000. Book deals are typically paid in installments, so the full financial windfall justices receive from their books will not be known for several more years. Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 2022 reported receiving a $425,000 advance on her book, a figure that drew some criticism. In this most recent report, however, she didn\u2019t list any additional income from that deal. Sotomayor, who has written a series of children\u2019s books, reported receiving two installments of royalty payments from Random House \u2014 a $47,704.63 payment in May 2023, and a $39,079.59 payment in December. Gifts and travel revealed on disclosures Jackson reported the Beyonc\u00e9 concert tickets \u2014 worth a total $3,711.84 \u2014 as part of a disclosure mandate for gifts worth $480 or more. The artist Lonnie Holley, meanwhile, gifted Jackson artwork for her chambers valued at $10,000. The justice also received artwork worth $2,5000 from Dr. Kathi Earles-Ross and others. Justice Clarence Thomas said he received two photo albums worth a total $2,000 from Terrence and Barbara Giroux. Terrence Giroux is the executive director emeritus of the Horatio Alger Association, an elite philanthropic organization of which Thomas is a member. The annual disclosures, which are required by law, provide only a rough sketch of the finances of the justices and lower court judges. But the reports have drawn considerable attention in recent years amid a series of ethics scandals involving private jet travel and luxury vacations accepted by some of the justices. Several justices reported foreign and domestic travel paid for by law schools and outside legal groups. Gorsuch, for instance, reported traveling to Lisbon, Portugal, last summer with George Mason University for an \u201ceducation program\u201d and to London months earlier for a Federalist Society program. Kavanaugh and Barrett also both traveled to London last year, both with the University of Notre Dame. Others listed domestic trips, including Justice Elena Kagan, who was reimbursed for travel to Notre Dame in Indiana for a speech in September. Sotomayor was reimbursed for a trip to Los Angeles last summer for an award ceremony and to Harvard University in November to sit on a moot court. The new disclosures also revealed income justices received from various side gigs.\u00a0Multiple justices received income for teaching and for rental properties, while Sotomayor was paid for a voice-acting role on an animated show. Gorsuch received $29,798.20 last year for teaching at George Mason University, while Kavanaugh\u2019s gig teaching at Notre Dame Law school brought him $25,000. Barrett was paid $14,947.50 last year by Notre Dame, where she is an adjunct professor. That is significantly less than the nearly $30,000 in 2022 teaching income from Notre Dame that she reported on her annual disclosures last year. For a voice performance on the animated television show \u201cAlma\u2019s Way,\u201d Sotomayor received $1,879.16. Sotomayor also reported rental income from a property in New York and a property in Florida, while Chief Justice John Roberts disclosed rental income from a cottage in Maine\u00a0and from a cottage he partially owns in Ireland. Thomas listed rental income received through an LLC called \u201cGinger Holdings\u201d for a property in Nebraska, his wife\u2019s home state. Kagan, meanwhile, said she made somewhere between $15,001 to $50,000 last year renting out a parking space in Washington, DC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-beyonce-concert-tickets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Trump, who\u00a0faces the possibility of a prison sentence\u00a0after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked\u00a0in an interview aired Sunday\u00a0on Fox News about how he had \u201cfamously said\u2026\u00a0\u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president.

He called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by\u00a0using the phrase \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue.

She has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a June 2016 speech in California. \u201cShe has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0repeated\u00a0in an October 2016 speech in Florida.\u00a0And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Trump\u00a0softened his rhetoric\u00a0shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and didn\u2019t feel strongly about prosecuting her.

The courtroom proceedings have delved into a painful moment for the Biden family, as Hunter was struggling with drug addiction in the aftermath of his brother Beau\u2019s death. First lady Dr. Jill Biden attended the trial before traveling to France to join her husband for D-Day commemoration activities. The White House had said previously that Biden would not pardon his son. \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear; the president is not going to pardon his son,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in December. The president\u2019s son is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he\u2019s been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. The charges were brought by special counsel David Weiss. It\u2019s\u00a0the first time in US history that\u00a0the child of a sitting president\u00a0has been on trial.

Adam Kinzinger\u2019s chief of staff Austin Weatherford as the leader of Republican outreach, operatives in Biden\u2019s headquarters in Wilmington have been digging in on focus groups and polling for clues \u2013 particularly about the consistent 20% who kept turning out for Nikki Haley in Republican primaries long after she gave up on her campaign. They muse about Haley-supporting suburban moms focused on national security. They insist there are middle of the road voters exhausted by Trump\u2019s attacks on the Constitution and restoring decency who are ready to find Biden palatable. CNN\u2019s interviews with two dozen Republican officials and aides, as well as multiple people in the White House and Biden campaign, detail the sometimes stilting, always-a-little-awkward conversations underway between liberal, mostly younger aides and frustrated, mostly older Republicans that go far beyond the generic statements about welcoming Haley voters and a few small but targeted online ads that the campaign has publicly announced. Senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn has already met with several potential allies like Cassidy Hutchinson, the former assistant to Trump\u2019s chief of staff who turned on the former president in her testimony to the January 6 committee, according to people told about the meeting. Several campaign aides spent last Wednesday on a Zoom call with two dozen Republican former members of Congress, hearing out their complaints and asking them to get involved. Others who have turned on Trump, like his short-tenured communications director Anthony Scaramucci, have been consulted. Liz Cheney, the former Republican congresswoman, is being deliberately given space to get to what many expect will eventually be a rip-roaring fulfilment of her promise to do what she can to keep Trump from getting back into the Oval Office. And a slate of GOP speakers for the Democratic convention in August and into the fall is being planned, following a similar schedule and roll-out as in 2020, when former Ohio Gov. John Kasich talked about how terrible Trump was and\u00a0Cindy McCain recorded an emotional video\u00a0about Biden\u2019s \u201cfriendship that shouldn\u2019t have worked\u201d with her late husband. In a slide obtained by CNN of the pitch campaign aides made to the Republicans on the Zoom call \u2013 next to photos of Biden meeting with members of the military and greeting young children \u2013 they laid out their wish list, including \u201cHelp us develop tailored outreach plans to recruit high profile Republican endorsements and supporters,\u201d \u201cVolunteer to be surrogates for print, TV, radio, podcasts and digital media stories, including op-Eds,\u201d and \u201cMake yourselves available to bracket key milestones in the Trump campaign,\u201d along with asking for more advice and help notching endorsements from veterans and law enforcement. \u201cRepublicans are leaving Trump in numbers that are well beyond what we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, one of Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign managers and his 2024 campaign chair. The June 27 debate and other contrast points, she predicted, will remind people \u201cabout the chaos and the lack of leadership of Trump\u201d and \u201charden those protest votes.\u201d The presentation to the Republican former lawmakers went further: \u201cMany of you will be having these conversations in ways we could not. We need to create systems for feedback loops to bring your read-outs into our campaign strategy.\u201d But battered and lonely after years of feeling chased out of their own party, many anti-Trump Republican leaders complain they still haven\u2019t heard from the Biden campaign. Agonizing about voting for a Democrat \u2013 even with all they\u2019ve said about the threat they believe Trump represents \u2013 they insist Biden still has to \u201cearn\u201d their votes and that his positions on Israel and other issues are making that harder. They talk in terms like \u201ccreating a permission structure\u201d and \u201cmattering on the margins\u201d as they insist there are more voters like them across the country who don\u2019t want to tell their friends or families \u2013 or even pollsters \u2013 because they fear being attacked, doxxed, swatted and harassed but will vote against Trump once the curtains on the voting booths are pulled tight. But while former Virginia Rep. Denver Riggleman told CNN he dreams of a big locking arms event with Biden and fellow apostate Republicans at the White House and Kinzinger told CNN he has offered advice about making more speeches about the fight for democracy in Ukraine, others say they are disappointed to see higher profile anti-Trump Republicans like former House Speaker Paul Ryan sit out so far. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Trump Vice President Mike Pence have said they can\u2019t vote for either candidate. Neither responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tech billionaire and\u00a0\u201cShark Tank\u201d star Mark Cuban, who supported Haley before popping into a Biden fundraiser in Dallas in March, doesn\u2019t think the decision he\u2019s made is a \u201cbig revelation or change.\u201d \u201cI think Joe is a better choice than Trump. That simple,\u201d he told CNN. He wishes he could have compared Biden and Haley or another Republican on the issues, he said. \u201cI miss those kinds of elections.\u201d But then there\u2019s Larry Hogan, the Republican former governor of Maryland now running for Senate, who \u2013 minutes before the Trump verdict came in last week \u2013 stood at the front of a room in a retirement home in the suburbs north of Baltimore last week nodding along as a man put a different spin on what has become a very familiar question for him: What should be done about \u201cthat one Mr. T \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about the one wearing all the jewelry.\u201d \u201cMr. T, \u2018I pity the fool,\u2019\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWhat a great question.\u201d Hogan, who also endorsed Haley, went into detail about how long he has been critical of Trump, explained that the former president is leading in the polls because Biden has done so badly, \u201cbut I have confidence in the American people that hopefully between now and November, they\u2019re going to make the right decision.\u201d Hogan left out which decision he will make himself. In an interview outside after, he said he wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump or Biden because he doesn\u2019t think either would be a good president and, given that Maryland is expected to be solid blue, \u201cI\u2019m not going to impact the election.\u201d Shortly afterward, Trump campaign officials said Hogan\u2019s campaign should be over because he released a statement saying to respect the New York verdict. Strains over the \u2018neither\u2019 option Many of Haley\u2019s voters were just using her spot on the ballot as a repository for anti-Trump votes, but Republicans and Democrats alike expect most of those voters to \u2013 like the former South Carolina governor \u2013 go back to Trump even if he never does anything to win them over, as she had said he would have to. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican and committed Trump supporter, said that he\u2019s been pushing Trump to do more outreach but isn\u2019t concerned: \u201cWhen it\u2019s Biden-Trump, I think most of them are going to come back. And I think those who don\u2019t come back will be offset by people on the left\u201d abandoning Biden. One person who hasn\u2019t gotten a call: Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas whose 2024 GOP primary campaign never got out of the single digits. On his way out of the Capitol after the unveiling ceremony for Arkansas\u2019s new statue of civil rights leader Daisy Bates, Hutchinson said that the votes for Haley should be \u201ca great concern\u201d for Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to worry that in November you\u2019re going to have a lot of voters that will skip that box and go to a Senate race, or they\u2019re going to stay at home,\u201d Hutchinson said, predicting a repeat of a 2020 phenomenon that boosted down-ballot Republicans and left Trump seething that there must have been a conspiracy against him. Or, he argued, \u201cthey\u2019re likely to stay home.\u201d Hutchinson told CNN he won\u2019t stay home himself, but he won\u2019t vote for Biden or Trump. Prompted with the idea that one of those two is almost certain to be president, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d Indiana Sen. Todd Young \u2013 who has said he won\u2019t be voting for Trump because of the events of January 6, 2021, and other issues, but also won\u2019t be voting for Biden \u2013 was visibly strained when confronted with the question last month of whether there\u2019s anything that the Democrat could do to win his vote. \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d Young told CNN after a vote on the Senate floor. Young stepped onto the subway that runs from the Capitol back to his office building and moved to the back of the car so that reporters could not follow him in. Asked as the doors closed whether he saw the election as a binary choice, Young grimaced. \u201cIt typically is,\u201d he said. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency administrator under George W. Bush, who is planning to vote for Biden as she did four years ago, said the \u201cneither\u201d answer is not acceptable. \u201cThey should understand that\u2019s the worst possible response, because what you\u2019re saying, is \u2018I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to be just fine,\u2019\u201d Whitman said, arguing the only excuse is people who might be scared of getting attacked or doxxed or swatted from going public. \u201cAll that does is empower people that you don\u2019t want to be empowered.\u201d But Whitman, who in 2020 was the national chair of Republicans and Independents for Biden, has not heard from the Biden campaign this time. Joe Walsh, the former Illinois congressman who briefly ran a 2020 primary challenge against Trump, was blunter. \u201cI understand it: They\u2019re utter cowards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to not be a Republican anymore. As bad as they think Biden is on policy, they know Trump is unfit.\u201d Dreams of rebuilding a traditional GOP Some anti-Trump Republicans who don\u2019t want their party to be this way have tried to get themselves into a familiar Zen: Trump would serve four more years, they figure, probably pass some tax cuts they would agree with, and then he would fade because he wouldn\u2019t be running for president anymore. Some feel like they fought Trump as long as they could but think now is the time to accept that they lost and make the best of it. Some insist they remain the true Republican Party and see 2024 as the chance to wrest it back from the pretenders they see in Trump and others who have followed him to the point of wearing marching long red ties, that their votes for Biden will be the first steps in rebuilding a Republican Party where Reaganism rises again over MAGA. \u201cWho are the real Republicans \u2013 the Maggots or people like me, who believe in markets, who believe in family, who believe in a military that is strong but also diplomacy? I maintain that I\u2019m the real Republican and the Maggots are not. They are the RINOs,\u201d said Claudine Schneider, a former Republican congresswoman from Rhode Island, using a derogatory riff on MAGA and the \u201cRepublicans in Name Only\u201d acronym Trump often uses for Republicans who don\u2019t support him. Schneider said traditional Republican values should point to Biden. While she said she has heard the complaints he has veered too far left, investments like infrastructure and the CHIPS and Science Act are what her fellow Republicans should support \u2013 and also, she added, because \u201che, I believe, can be trusted. He has integrity. And that cannot be said of the other guy whose life is all about lying and cheating.\u201d Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia and current CNN contributor, broke with Trump and\u00a0wrote an op-ed in May saying he was voting for Biden and encouraging other Republicans to join him. He explained that he hoped he could be the bridge both to more bipartisan policy out of Biden and for voters to reject Trump and start sending non-MAGA Republicans to Congress. \u201cThis is a really easy play: We need about 10 million Republicans to say, \u2018Enough. Enough, enough, enough \u2013 we can no longer fake the fact that Donald Trump is a real Republican,\u2019\u201d Duncan said, imagining that if 10 million Republicans vote in down-ballot candidates, then during a Biden second term, \u201cwe give ourselves four years to hit the reset button, rebuild the Republican Party.\u201d Duncan said he started to make the case on the bipartisanship to Biden when the president called him to thank him for the op-ed and felt good about the conversation. But on Israel, immigration and other top policy areas, frustration among Republican leaders with Biden remains high, as does skepticism among Republicans that he is interested in sincere compromise with them at the risk of aggravating his own base. \u201cThis swath of Republican strategist types are literally begging the Biden campaign to give them a reason to support him,\u201d a former House Republican leadership aide told CNN. \u201c\u2018Will he do that?\u2019 is the unanswered question.\u201d Two Bushes, neither in hand for Biden George H.W. Bush put out word in 2016 that he voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump. People involved tell CNN that Biden\u2019s campaign reached out to George W. Bush in 2020 to see about an endorsement then but came up short \u2013 the only other living Republican president wanted to stick to his philosophy that ex-presidents should stay out of direct politics. That didn\u2019t stop his clearly non-MAGA worldview from slipping out several times over Trump\u2019s presidency, conspicuously very quickly congratulating Biden after the election was called and condemning January 6 in a statement, \u201cI am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.\u201d Though Bush\u2019s popularity has plummeted among Republicans overall, \u201che\u2019s obviously the biggest voice of any of us. He\u2019s a decent man,\u201d said Kinzinger. \u201cIt would certainly give a permission for a lot of people. There are still Bush Republicans left that are voting for Trump grudgingly, and they just don\u2019t know their party has left them yet.\u201d Responding to radio host Howard Stern last month asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Jeb Bush? Where\u2019s George Bush? Why don\u2019t they say \u2018Hey, I\u2019m interested in saving democracy for our grandchildren?\u2019\u201d Biden said only, \u201cWell \u2013 I don\u2019t think the election is over yet on that score.\u201d Asked about whether that meant there were conversations underway and if he would consider voting for Biden in November, Jeb Bush, who has taken to tweeting approvingly about articles that decry the state of American politics, told CNN by email that he wasn\u2019t going to comment, but \u201cthanks for thinking of me.\u201d In the Maryland Senate race, Hogan said Bush called to urge him to get in because, Hogan recalled the former president, saying, \u201cI think you\u2019re the voice to get us back on track.\u201d Hogan said Bush had been disappointed he hadn\u2019t run in the Republican presidential primary against Trump \u2013 but added that he would be surprised if 43 weighed in directly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to interfere,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t still have opinions and he doesn\u2019t still care about things.\u201d A spokesman for the former president also declined comment. \u201cYou can hold your nose and vote for Biden and not be in public screaming about it. You can mark your ballot, vote to keep this democracy going instead of voting affirmatively to end it,\u201d said Kristopher Purcell, an operative who in 2020 was on the organizing committee for a group called 43 Alumni for Biden. But Purcell has also not yet heard from the Biden campaign this time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-anti-trump-republicans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this.

{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_cia-netanyahu-assessment", "text": "A CIA assessment circulated among US officials this week concluded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likely judges he can get away without defining a post-war plan \u2014\u00a0even as the Biden administration has launched a full-court press to pressure him to bring an end to the conflict in Gaza. Netanyahu \u201cprobably believes he can maintain support from his security chiefs and prevent defections\u201d from the right wing of his coalition by discussing the future of Gaza in \u201cvague terms,\u201d the June 3 report, reviewed by CNN, reads. The assessment \u2014 which has not been previously reported \u2014\u00a0represents one of the most up to date intelligence assessments about Netanyahu\u2019s mindset that has been circulated among senior US officials, according to a source familiar with internal reporting. It comes amid a clear shift in how the Biden administration views Israel: less as a trusted partner and more as an unpredictable foreign government to be analyzed and understood. The CIA declined to comment when asked about CNN\u2019s reporting. The assessment highlights how the Israeli leader is defying pressure from members of his own government and the Biden administration to define an \u201cend state\u201d for Gaza and warns what Netanyahu has said publicly is likely true: that he will only engage seriously on post-war issues after meeting \u201cwhat he sees as key security benchmarks, which may take months.\u201d According to the assessment, those benchmarks include completing \u201cmajor military operations\u201d \u2014\u00a0something analysts have said is deliberately vague \u2014 as well as eliminating Hamas military commander\u00a0Mohammed\u00a0Deif. Deif\u00a0is the commander of the Qassam Brigades and,\u00a0as a senior commander of the military\u00a0wing\u00a0of Hamas, is believed to have been deeply involved in the planning of the October 7, 2023,\u00a0attacks\u00a0in Israel. Israel has tried to target Deif multiple times in the past,\u00a0and although he has been injured, he is believed to still be alive. The report is consistent with what CNN and others have reported in the days since President Joe Biden announced a three-pronged peace deal proposal on Friday. It comes as senior Biden administration officials, including CIA Director Bill Burns, are meeting with key mediators between Israel and Hamas at a particularly tense moment in negotiations. Burns has been the primary US negotiator on a potential agreement. The US has publicly characterized the deal as an Israeli proposal and has said it is waiting for Hamas to approve the terms. But Israel has been tepid at best on the proposal. Privately, officials have long been clear-eyed about the difficulty of getting both sides to reach an agreement. The relationship between Biden and Netanyahu \u2014\u00a0a world leader whom he once claimed to \u201clove\u201d \u2014\u00a0has been increasingly strained as the civilian death toll in Gaza has mounted as a result of Israel\u2019s bombing campaign. Biden and other American officials have grown more and more critical of Netanyahu in public. Although initially the administration was deeply reluctant to discuss Israeli politics in public, officials have in recent weeks and months inched closer to frank assessments of Netanyahu\u2019s motivations. \u201cThere is every reason for people to draw [the] conclusion\u201d that Netanyanhu is prolonging the war for his own political gain, Biden said in a TIME magazine interview this week. In one early and stark moment in March, the US intelligence community said publicly that it assessed Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cviability as a leader\u201d was \u201cin jeopardy,\u201d pointing to public distrust of the prime minister\u2019s ability to rule and predicting \u201clarge protests demanding his resignation and new elections.\u201d Netanyahu faces a domestic reckoning over the military and intelligence failures that led to Hamas\u2019 devastating attack on southern Israel on October 7. He also faces deep divisions inside his own government. Even amid stiff pressure from Biden to wrap up the war, he faces equally strident pressure from rightwing officials in his fragile governing coalition to continue fighting. The CIA assessment highlights that, within Israel, there is no consensus on the postwar plan for Gaza, indicating each cabinet minister\u2019s ranging views on postwar governance, security and reconstruction. Netanyahu, for example, is depicted alongside a blurb noting he \u201cprefers a coalition of moderate Arab states to manage the territory with eventual participation\u201d from other leaders. Other Israeli leaders are depicted as having various views on future governance that are diametrically opposed to those attributed to Netanyahu. Overall, the assessment illustrates how Israel\u2019s coalition government remains deeply divided over several critical post-war issues \u2013 supporting the CIA\u2019s broader conclusion that a lack of unity among Netanyahu\u2019s political rivals could enable his continued defiance of any pressure to define a plan for Gaza once the conflict ends. \u201cMy major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after Gaza\u2019s over?\u201d Biden told TIME. \u201cWhat does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/politics/cia-netanyahu-assessment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to try to depict Democrats as the \u201ctrue radicals\u201d on abortion policy. To make his case, though, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made wildly inaccurate claims. In a Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump said, \u201cHard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born. Killing a person after birth is illegal in every state. \u201cEvery state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,\u201d Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no basis for this claim,\u201d Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said Thursday. The Trump campaign did not respond to a CNN request to specify which states Trump was talking about. Mutcherson said: \u201cThe falsity of the claim can be seen in the fact that Trump never identifies such a state.\u201d There was at least one instance, in an interview with NBC last year, in which Trump specified that he was making the claim about the state of New York in addition to unspecified \u201cother places.\u201d But he was wrong then, too: New York did not pass a law allowing babies to be killed after birth, though false social media posts claimed it had. Similar false claims have circulated about California. Some of those claims were based on criticism of vague language in an early version of a Democratic state legislator\u2019s 2022 bill that was intended to protect people from being prosecuted over miscarriages, stillbirths and self-managed abortions. But the vague language was revised before the bill was signed into law. Months before passage, a Democratic-led legislative committee acknowledged that the early text\u2019s vague use of the phrase \u201cperinatal death\u201d might have inadvertently left open the interpretation that the bill would immunize people from punishment in all cases in which their baby died in the first days of its life, even in cases where the death was caused by acts after the baby was born. The final bill that was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom clarified that the \u201cperinatal death\u201d immunity is specifically for \u201cperinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero.\u201d In other words, there is no basis for a claim that California passed a law legalizing post-birth executions. A repeated false claim about legal scholars Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country. During his current presidential campaign, he has repeatedly made the false claim that all legal scholars had wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and power over abortion policy returned to individual states. Trump said it again in the Fox News interview: \u201cI say, let the states decide. This is \u2014 every legal scholar wanted this to be where abortion should be.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to the states is not even close to true. Many legal scholars wanted Roe preserved, as several of them reiterated in April comments to CNN.  \u201cAny claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\u201d Mutcherson, who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s claim is flatly incorrect,\u201d Maya Manian, an American University law professor who also did not want Roe overturned,\u00a0said in April. Trump\u2019s claim is \u201cobviously not\u201d true, said Ziegler, another scholar who did not want Roe overturned. She said in April: \u201cMost legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn\u2019t want to overturn Roe. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.\u201d You can read a more detailed fact check of this claim here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-abortion-babies-executed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_biden-gun-violence-speech", "text": "President Joe Biden will address a major gun violence prevention conference in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, nearly two years after he signed the first major federal gun safety legislation in decades. The appearance, first shared with CNN, comes as the White House and the Biden campaign have sought to promote the president\u2019s work to tackle gun violence \u2014 an issue his team believes resonates with key blocs of voters, including women, young people and Latino communities. Biden is set to speak at Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund\u2019s \u201cGun Sense University,\u201d an annual conference bringing together gun violence survivors, volunteers and advocates for training on organizing efforts. Attendees will include volunteers from Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action, two groups founded in the wake of major mass shootings in schools.\u00a0The volunteers will fan out across Capitol Hill for meetings with lawmakers to push for further gun safety laws on Tuesday. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s appearance at Gun Sense University is just the latest example of his decades-long commitment to solving America\u2019s gun violence crisis,\u201d said\u00a0John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cWhen it comes to gun safety, President Biden understands that this is truly a life-or-death issue, and our volunteers are proud to stand alongside the Biden-Harris Administration.\u201d The president\u2019s speech will take place two weeks before the anniversary of the signing of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, comprehensive gun safety legislation that received Democratic and Republican support in the wake of the massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022. The legislation enhanced background checks and boosted money for mental health programs. The administration this year tapped a provision in the law to attempt to close the so-called \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d But the bill fell short of achieving some of Democrats\u2019 long-sought-after gun reforms, including passing an assault weapons ban that Biden has vowed to pursue if reelected. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back and once again\u00a0ban\u00a0assault\u00a0weapons\u00a0in America,\u201d Biden said at a rally in Philadelphia last month. \u201cI did it once; I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads the White House\u2019s Office of Gun Violence, has focused on a series of gun violence prevention events this week around National Gun Violence Awareness Day, including a Maryland campaign event Friday with Angela Alsobrooks, the state\u2019s Democratic nominee for Senate. Harris met Thursday with six survivors of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School who are now set to graduate from high school this year. \u201cYesterday, I met with survivors of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting who are now graduating from high school,\u201d Harris posted on X with photos of the meeting. \u201cEmma, Grace, Matt, Ella, Henry, and Lilly: Thanks for your strength, courage, and leadership.\u201d The students were all first-graders when a gunman opened fire at the Newtown, Connecticut, school, killing 20 of their fellow classmates and six adults. Biden wrote a letter to the Uvalde community last month on the two-year anniversary of that shooting, which killed 19 students and two teachers. He praised the efforts of the families and communities to press for greater action to address gun violence, saying they \u201chave made their voices heard \u2014 and our country has listened.\u201d The Biden campaign released an ad coinciding with the anniversary to contrast the president\u2019s record on guns against that of former President Donald Trump, who has vowed to\u00a0\u201croll back every Biden attack on the Second Amendment\u201d if he wins a second term. The ad in Spanish and English ran on digital platforms in the swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania, with the ad buy specifically targeting Latino voters. The Biden campaign believes the tragic shooting in Uvalde and more broadly the issue of gun violence resonates across the Latino community. A CNN/SSRS poll conducted in April found nearly half of registered voters \u2014 48% \u2014 said gun policy will be extremely important to their presidential vote in November. A Gallup survey last year found 56% of US adults believe gun laws in the country should be stricter.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_politics_takeaways-from-day-5-of-hunter-bidens-gun-trial", "text": "Special counsel prosecutors rested their case against Hunter Biden on Friday, and his lawyers said they\u2019ll decide over the weekend whether he testifies in his own defense. That would be a bold and risky move for President Joe Biden\u2019s son, who could face prison time if he is convicted of the felony gun charges that he\u2019s currently facing. He has pleaded not guilty to lying on federal background check forms about his drug use and to possessing a gun while addicted to drugs. The defense began presenting its case as well on Friday, calling Biden\u2019s daughter Naomi Biden. She said she was \u201cnervous\u201d and appeared uncomfortable at times, including when confronted by prosecutors about some difficult texts with her father \u2013 texts which could lead to questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s state of mind that October. Here\u2019s what to know about Day 5 of the trial: Daughter \u2018was hopeful\u2019 about Hunter\u2019s recovery Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys said earlier on that his daughter Naomi and his uncle James could tell the jury about how the defendant was moving away from drugs and toward recovery around when he bought the gun. Naomi Biden described visiting her father in summer 2018, while he was in rehab in Los Angeles and working with a sober companion. \u201cHe seemed like the clearest that I had seen him since my uncle died,\u201d she said, referring to her uncle Beau Biden, who died from brain cancer in 2015, later adding, \u201cI told him that I was so proud of him.\u201d Moving forward to October 2018 \u2013 the month Hunter Biden bought the gun \u2013 he was in New York and Naomi saw him briefly to give him back his truck. \u201cWe exchanged the car with my dad and he still seemed good, and I was hopeful,\u201d she said. Naomi didn\u2019t see\u00a0drug remnants in Hunter\u2019s car During cross-examination by the prosecutors, Naomi Biden testified that she never used drugs and did not bring any drugs or paraphernalia into the truck before returning the vehicle to her father on October 19. Within the week, Hunter went back down to Delaware. Earlier this week Beau\u2019s widow Hallie Biden, who later dated Hunter, testified that she found remnants of crack cocaine in the car when she searched it on October 23, the same day she discovered the gun. Naomi Biden later, however, seemed a little confused and reticent when confronted with texts appearing to show her father to be somewhat erratic and non-communicative while they tried to arrange the car handoff. As she left the stand, Naomi Biden gave her dad an embrace, a kiss on the cheek, and was seen trembling and wiping away tears as she exited the courtroom. \u2018Down to that last decision\u2019 After the lunch break. Hunter\u2019s lawyer Abbe Lowell announced that the defense would not ask James Biden to testify and court adjourned early. Biden\u2019s team said they want to take the weekend to decide whether the defendant takes the stand in his own defense. At least one witnesses previously described him as \u201cextremely charming,\u201d and he is known to share some of the same folksy affability as his father. He is from Delaware, and his family is a fixture in this state, where all of the jurors are from. \u201cWe are down to that last decision,\u201d Lowell told the judge. It would be a risky move. In pretrial filings, prosecutors said there was a host of thorny and potentially damaging matters that they\u2019d want to bring up if he took the stand. Prosecutors rest their case As is true in all criminal trials, the burden is on the prosecutors to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury. Nobody is contesting that Hunter Biden was a longtime drug abuser. His own memoir is filled with tales of his many crack cocaine binges and relapses. And the jury heard Hunter\u2019s story from his own perspective early on, when prosecutors played portions of his audiobook, where he described trolling homeless encampments for dealers and smoking crack nearly nonstop at the peak of his addiction. Prosecutors hope the jury will connect the dots between that vast evidence of his addiction and the gun that he bought on October 12, 2018, and possessed for less than two weeks. His ex-girlfriend Zoe Kestan testified Wednesday that she watched Biden smoke crack in September, and Hallie Biden, said he appeared to be \u201cunder the influence\u201d when occasionally she saw him in October 2018.

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_bob-menendez-trial-gurbir-grewal", "text": "New Jersey\u2019s top prosecutor and a high-ranking deputy had just finished a 2019 meeting with US Sen. Bob Menendez in the Democrat\u2019s Newark office. After a quiet elevator ride down to their car, Andrew Bruck turned to his boss, state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, and broke the silence. \u201cWhoa,\u201d Bruck said, \u201cthat was gross.\u201d The unnerving exchange with Menendez, Grewal testified in federal court Thursday, was his second such conversation with the senator, who is being tried on charges that he engaged in a bribery scheme and acted as a foreign agent for the Egyptian government. Like in a previous exchange, months earlier, Menendez told Grewal he was concerned over the treatment of Hispanic defendants \u2013 a worry, the senator said on both occasions, tied to a specific, ongoing case being handled by the attorney general\u2019s office of insurance. Grewal, who left office in 2021, told the court that the initial call had caught him off-guard. He had no personal relationship with the senator, who called him on his private line after obtaining the number through Grewal\u2019s cousin. After some small talk, Grewal said, Menendez pivoted to the matter he would bring up again in his office \u2013 with no one present but him and the two visitors \u2013 on September 6, 2019. On both occasions, Grewal testified, he told Menendez that the defense lawyer in the case, Michael Critchley, should be the one to raise any issues \u2013 and that if he did, they should be directed not to him but to the prosecution team or judge. Menendez, in Grewal\u2019s opinion, seemed surprised that Bruck had come along for the in-person meeting. Once inside, seated at a small circular conference table at the front of Menendez\u2019s sprawling, high-windowed office, the senator again pressed Grewal on the treatment of Hispanic defendants. Grewal said Menendez then, once again, brought up the case of Elvis Parra, who had been indicted on insurance fraud charges. Parra was an associate of businessman Jose Uribe, who was indicted as part of the bribery scheme before striking a plea deal with federal prosecutors earlier this year. Grewal testified that Menendez never explicitly identified the case or defendants by name in either interaction, only telling Grewal it involved Hispanic truckers prosecuted by the insurance fraud division in the attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the case. I didn\u2019t want to know the case,\u201d Grewal said, telling the court he still does not know the details of the case Menendez was discussing. The meeting ended shortly thereafter, lasting about 15 minutes. Menendez had retreated to small talk, Grewal said, after the attorney general again refused to engage on the specifics. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an explicit ask,\u201d Grewal told the court, but he had become concerned that Menendez was trying to meddle with the case. He did not tell any of his rank-and-file attorneys about their exchanges. \u201cInsulating the team from any type of pressure or interference from the outside\u201d was an important part of his job, Grewal said, telling the court he believed spreading word of Menendez\u2019s interest risked creating \u201ca chilling effect\u201d around the case. Menendez\u2019s lawyers disputed that notion, repeatedly asking Grewal if their client had in any way threatened or sought to intimidate him. His answer, over and over again, was no. The pressure, Grewal said, was baked into their conversations from the start. Menendez \u201cwas a close political ally of the governor\u2019s, so that was my concern, sort of being on his bad side,\u201d Grewal testified. Grewal is the government\u2019s 14th witness in a trial that is already in its fourth week,\u00a0as prosecutors try to prove Menendez, two co-defendants and the senator\u2019s wife, Nadine, engaged in a global bribery scheme that delivered the Menendezes gold bars, blocks of cash and a new Mercedes in exchange for the senator using his post and power to influence public officials to benefit his associates. \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Lara Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, told the jury in her opening remarks. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket.\u201d The senator\u2019s team has insisted that he committed no crimes and, to the extent that there had been any unsavory business dealings, Nadine Menendez was the driving force. Nadine\u2019s trial was separated and pushed back to this summer. The senator disclosed last month that she has breast cancer. In testimony a day earlier, an FBI agent combed through a massive trove of communications among the alleged conspirators, including text message exchanges focused on the Parra case. In January 2019, Nadine, who was Menendez\u2019s girlfriend at the time, asked Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman and one of the co-defendants, to tell her \u201cwhat the charges are.\u201d (Lawyers for Hana and developer Fred Daibes, the third alleged co-conspirator, declined to cross-examine Grewal.) \u201cThe matter only involves four counts,\u201d Hana replied, and is \u201ca relatively small indictment.\u201d A few minutes later, Nadine called the senator. Uribe is expected to testify Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/bob-menendez-trial-gurbir-grewal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_06_politics_steve-bannon-jail", "text": "A federal judge on Thursday ordered Steve Bannon to report to prison by July 1, giving the former Donald Trump adviser a short window to get a higher court\u2019s intervention. Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress in 2022 after failing to provide\u00a0documents and testimony\u00a0to the House Select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. He was sentenced to four months in prison. The federal judge presiding over the case, Carl Nichols, had initially paused the sentence while Bannon appealed the conviction. Last month, however, a DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, and prosecutors immediately asked Nichols to send Bannon to prison to begin serving his sentence. Nichols said Thursday that, given the appeals court ruling, he did not believe the basis he had for pausing Bannon\u2019s sentence \u201cexists any longer.\u201d The judge, who was appointed by Trump, said that he concluded that he had the authority to lift the hold on Bannon\u2019s sentence, even as an appeal of conviction will continue. Potential high court intervention Shortly after the hearing concluded, Bannon vowed to fight his contempt of Congress conviction \u201call the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\u201d Bannon also claimed without evidence that his prosecution by the Justice Department was about \u201cshutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There\u2019s not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,\u201d he told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win at the Supreme Court,\u201d he added. Second ex-Trump adviser punished over subpoena non-compliance At the hearing, Bannon\u2019s attorney, David Schoen, argued that his client should be able to remain out of prison until the Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the case. Schoen also said that his request for the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case would be filed by June 24. Prosecutor John Crabb said that Bannon had not satisfied the legal threshold for staying out of prison while his appeal continued. Crabb pointed to the failed effort by Peter Navarro, another ex-Trump adviser prosecuted for refusing to comply with a House January 6 committee subpoena, to pause his sentenced \u2014 an effort that was rebuffed by the DC Circuit and the Supreme Court. Nichols said Navarro\u2019s case presented different issues, and the judge ultimately pointed to the fact that three appeals court judges \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d rejected the arguments Bannon was making in his case. Nichols noted that a member of the DC Circuit panel considering Bannon\u2019s case could have noted in a concurrence or dissent that they had concerns about the key precedent Bannon is seeking to overturn in his case, but no judge on the panel wrote such a statement. With a little less than a month until the surrender date, Bannon could try to file emergency motions with the appeals court and even the Supreme Court seeking to push off his sentence longer. After Nichols announced his order, Schoen tried again to convince Nichols to let Bannon stay out of prison, in an exchange with the judge that got heated. Navarro is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "politics"}}
