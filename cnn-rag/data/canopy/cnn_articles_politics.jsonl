{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s spotty debate performance immediately triggered new questions from worried Democrats about whether he would leave the presidential race. It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party\u2019s delegates means it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be forced out of the race against his will. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the \u201960s. Voters choose the nominee. He is the nominee,\u201d said CNN analyst and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, reacting to Biden\u2019s performance at the debate Thursday night on CNN. That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination. Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats\u2019 convention will return to Chicago in August. As we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February,\u00a0if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates \u2013\u00a0almost all of them currently pledged to Biden \u2013 allocated as part of the primary process. These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could\u00a0decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president\u2019s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against former President Donald Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party\u2019s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats \u2013\u00a0The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans \u2013\u00a0If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party\u2019s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party\u2019s nominee. Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate\u2019s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen.\u00a0Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.) The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_immunity-case-donald-trump-scotus", "text": "The biggest question now that the Supreme Court has decided Donald Trump is entitled to some immunity from prosecution: What happens next in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case against the former president? Assuming Smith stays the course, written arguments and even proceedings with witness testimony and evidence are likely to be next before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC. The special counsel\u2019s office has not responded yet publicly to the decision, and there is nothing at the moment on Chutkan\u2019s docket indicating what next steps will be taken in the trial court. Those are likely to come in the days after the Supreme Court hands the opinion down formally to the federal courts in DC. The mechanism for sending a case back down usually takes as a long as a month, but the high court could act more quickly \u2013 particularly if a party asks it to. Once Chutkan works through the legal issues, it\u2019s possible that more appeals could put the case on hold again. This is why it may be unlikely for Trump to go to trial this year, if at all. But courts can be hard to predict. What Trump is and isn\u2019t immune for The Supreme Court put one set of allegations against Trump \u2013 regarding his and his allies\u2019 efforts to weaponize the Justice Department \u2013 in the bucket of absolute immunity. For the several other categories of allegations, Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion said that the lower courts will have to go through a process of \u201cfact-specific\u201d and perhaps \u201cchallenging\u201d analysis. The Supreme Court said that\u00a0that Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Vice President Mike Pence to help him overturn the election is \u201cpresumptively\u201d immune, and put the burden on the prosecutors to rebut the presumptive immunity. As for Trump\u2019s state-level efforts to overturn the results, including the fake electors scheme, the high court told lower courts to analyze what of that conduct was an official act and what was not. Roberts said that analysis will require an \u201cassessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons.\u201d The lower courts will also have to parse what conduct was an official presidential act when it comes to Trump\u2019s January 6-related behavior and his comments that egged on the Capitol riot. Roberts said the lower courts may need to look \u201cwhat else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally\u201d in deciding which of those communications are immunized. If Chutkan does rule on on what is an official act and what is not, it\u2019s possible that Trump would appeal those rulings to the DC Circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling strongly suggests that those appeals would need to be resolved pre-trial, making it unlikely this case goes to a jury before Americans cast their ballots for president. Jack Smith\u2019s options going forward It\u2019s also possible that Smith\u2019s office winnows down his case to bring it in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. That could mean cutting out some parts of what they want to present to the jury, or even refiling the indictment against Trump so it doesn\u2019t allege violations related to the official work of the presidency. The special counsel\u2019s office will also have to grapple with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to cut out any evidence from that case that would be official actions of the President \u2013 throwing another wrench in how the case will be prosecuted. Still, with Chutkan, the timeline could move quickly \u2013 potentially as quickly as a few weeks for briefing and hearings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/immunity-case-donald-trump-scotus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_democratic-party-replacement-worries-joe-biden", "text": "They\u2019re not writing anything down. They\u2019re not making any firm commitments. But between staring into phones that started buzzing about three minutes into the debate and haven\u2019t stopped since, several of Joe Biden\u2019s leading possible Democratic replacements and top aides have started to think through what an unprecedented last-minute fight into the August convention might look like. They\u2019re already carefully monitoring their prospective opponents\u2019 moves as they go, looking both for openings and ways to call them out for getting ahead of the president. Multiple people connected with other candidates, for example, noted the \u201cinteresting timing\u201d of an already-scheduled fundraising appeal that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s PAC texted\u00a0out on Friday evening\u00a0that reads almost like a mission statement for her and points out how she won in her key presidential battleground state. More than two dozen top Democratic officials, political operatives and donors tied to Biden and to many of the people most discussed as potential substitutes \u2013 many of whom asked for anonymity to discuss the most politically fraught situation most have ever encountered \u2013 say they\u2019re terrified by nearly every scenario: Going forward with Biden, a Kamala Harris nomination, a nomination of someone else who would in that case have beaten the first Black female vice president, long nights of multiple ballots spilling ideological and personal feuds on national television, even just revelations of embarrassing details about people who have never been vetted by a national campaign. \u201cIt would be a Category 5 hurricane,\u201d said one top Democratic official nervous about Biden considering what would happen if the president stepped aside. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the sheer destruction that would be unleashed.\u201d To others, that stems from a prisoner\u2019s mentality that doesn\u2019t consider how much resistance there is to Trump. \u201cI think we can absolutely swap and win,\u201d said a major Democratic donor. \u201cIf Joe Biden\u2019s the nominee, we\u2019re all in. If someone else is the nominee, we\u2019re all in.\u201d A CBS News/YouGov poll out Sunday morning found only 55% of registered Democratic voters saying Biden should continue running, with 45% saying he should step aside. Biden campaign aides have spent the last couple of days pointing to metrics like some of their best grassroots fundraising days and a surge in job applications since Thursday. None of the speculation matters if a president who will be three months older by the next scheduled debate doesn\u2019t step aside. So far, he has stuck to an apologetic but defiant posture in public while in private saying he knows how bad his performance was but that he still thinks his candidacy is the only way forward. And since he won all the primaries, he controls most of the delegates, which means that they can only vote for someone else if he decides to pull out. Democrats feeling the ground move beneath their feet Multiple Democratic officials and operatives, some of whom are affiliated with alternatives and those who are not, rage that Biden has demonstrated too much of an ego to have bowed out before. The president\u2019s argument that he was the Democrat best able to beat Trump, several said, has now been turned on its head and they are left feeling he\u2019s the option least able to beat Trump. They say the president\u2019s inner circle who have been running the campaign and prepared him for the debate \u2013 and who told some privately ahead of Thursday night that the prep had gone well \u2013 are either not being honest or are not capable of steering him either toward an exit or a recovery. At a LGBTQ fundraiser in New York City on Friday night, one attendee said some of the conversations even turned against Jill Biden, with the deep love for her as the quirky reluctant political spouse quickly curdling into exasperation that she is not willing to make the move that would lead to them leaving the White House. Even as minds turn to a list that includes Harris, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and even relatively new Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, none have gone public with anything but words of support for Biden. They worry about being called traitors. They worry that it might make Biden dig in more. A debate watch party in Los Angeles on Thursday night happened to feature Harris\u2019 husband Doug Emhoff, Pritzker, Whitmer and Beshear. There were other high-profile attendees \u2013 by a few answers in, Rob Reiner was screaming about losing and Jane Fonda had tears in her eyes, according to people in the room. Even Barack Obama is choosing his words carefully. When asked about the debate by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at a fundraiser for House Democrats, he said Biden has \u201cthe values that reflect the best in America,\u201d but politics is a \u201cteam sport,\u201d with the president as \u201cthe captain.\u201d He added that getting Jeffries to be speaker is \u201cprobably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d Biden campaign aides dismiss not only the possibility that he will drop out, but that anyone could actually do better, or go up against Trump with a list of supporters that runs from progressive icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to conservative GOP former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. \u201cYou win elections by bringing everyone under one banner. If the imperative to you is winning, the best chance we have of doing it is the guy who has been in the White House, has a historic record of accomplishment and already beaten Donald Trump once, and not any of this mess,\u201d a senior Biden adviser told CNN. But in one demonstration of the scramble that the campaign is in over how to shoot down the replacement talk: on Friday morning, Biden aides said on a call that included a number of Democratic operatives that it would be dispatching Donna Brazile, the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, and leading Democratic operative Stephanie Cutter to explain why replacement would be a fantasy. Brazile, who has written about how she looked into the possibility of a post-convention replacement of the nominee after Hillary Clinton\u2019s stumble at a September 11 event in 2016, told CNN that she was not told this in advance. Cutter said she had not been either. But both said they remain committed to Biden and urged others to do the same. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who eyed a possible 2024 run of his own had Biden decided not to run, said he had dinner with Biden on Saturday night at a fundraiser he and his wife hosted and felt confident sticking by the president. Still, he mentioned the president\u2019s age twice in a brief interview, saying \u201che\u2019s 81.\u201d \u201cThere are very few people who can span the broad interests of our beloved Democratic Party in the same way he can. And he\u2019s proven that,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a prospective, \u2018Hey, I think he could do this.\u2019 He has done it. Not sure who else can do that.\u201d Murphy said he hadn\u2019t considered another option because \u201cbased on every data point, a dimension that I\u2019m aware of, he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d Harris\u2019 advantage going into an open convention If there is an opening, most agree Harris would have the early edge. If Biden did make a sudden exit, there would be pressure for him to give his party some direction, and doing anything other than tapping his vice president would be a snub bigger than when Obama wounded him so deeply by making clear that he saw Hillary Clinton as his own successor in the run-up to the 2016 election. To a convention hall full of loyal Biden delegates trying to recover their equilibrium, endorsing Harris could carry a lot of weight. A Harris backer insisted that the interest in anyone else at this point is just \u201cthe appeal of the unknown.\u201d Being unknown can have benefits, such as not having any of the entrenched bad feelings that have come to define her in the minds of some voters. But it also means that none of them have had their pasts and records delved into the way she has over her abbreviated presidential campaign, her time as running mate and as vice president. As the other name on the Biden-Harris campaign, the vice president would also be the only one legally able to take over the entire existing operation, along with all the money already raised \u2013 a fact overlooked by the Biden campaign in an email from deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty to supporters, which insisted that an alternative starting with zero dollars in their bank account would be \u201ca highway to losing.\u201d That would be on top of being the potential replacement with the largest national name recognition. She also stands even or a little ahead any of the other contenders in most of the polls that have posed the question of replacing Biden. People around Harris have of course considered all this. But her approach since the debate has been to put herself forward as the most dutiful and most loyal defender, to the point that the first lady \u2013 who has made her frustrations with Harris clear in the past \u2013 on Friday night picked up the defense that Harris landed on immediately after the debate. The vice president\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I\u2019ve been watching the last three-and-a-half years of performance,\u201d which people in her orbit say she came up with on the fly herself, has since been picked up by campaign operatives in addition to the first lady. Harris would have other advantages too. A top outside political adviser, Minyon Moore, was months ago named the official in charge of convention proceedings, and others like her former chief of staff Tina Flournoy and Brazile have key committee roles too. Nor are her supporters shy about making their opinions known. In an interview, Brazile said that her reaction to the calls that she has been getting since the debate with people inquiring about other candidates is: \u201cHow the f**k are you going to put all these white people ahead of Kamala?\u201d Backers of other possible candidates acknowledge that the internal feelings of deference toward her would be widespread and hard to overcome, and fears about the backlash among Black and women voters from ditching her would run extremely high. \u201cBiden\u2018s not stepping down and Kamala Harris gets the first shot in any open convention scenario,\u201d said one DNC delegate fond of one of the alternatives. Still, many worry that that\u2019s the kind of feeling that could mean much more among delegates to a Democratic convention than a wider electorate, and that it would just be setting her up to be the one carrying the banner into defeat. Potential for long nights fighting on national TV Not everyone is convinced. In a time of crisis for the Democratic Party like what this would open up, a combination of ambition and sense of duty would clearly be enticing. People connected with other prospective candidates say that Harris\u2019 years of scrutiny, association with Biden and her own word-salad answers could be too much to let her get a free pass. Some are already gaming out Harris failing on the first ballot and jumping in then. \u201cWould it be very hard and challenging? Yes. but I think there\u2019s actually a benefit to whoever the white knight is, riding in on a horse to save the campaign and the country,\u201d said one senior Democratic operative. But that probably would mean multiple candidates rushing around the convention floor making all sorts of promises, going through multiple ballots, with a melee of clashing candidacies and other interests all on non-stop coverage. Not to mention that it\u2019s been decades since the last floor fight. The happy activists who tend to get picked as delegates don\u2019t know how to cut backroom deals. They don\u2019t even know the rules. Democratic operatives always like to mock headlines that describe them as \u201cin disarray.\u201d Now some tell CNN they worry they could end up in more disarray than ever. Some operatives are already daydreaming about who would be part of various outreach teams, which chits they\u2019d be able to call in from previous support, what strengths they\u2019d emphasize about their preferred candidates and what points could undercut prospective opponents. This kind of showdown would almost certainly benefit politicians who could get good teams together quickly, several acknowledged, making a Cinderella story less likely than an established force who moves in hard and fast. Democratic operatives know that political junkies will love it, but they worry about the message that will send to the country overall as they try to put themselves forward as the alternatives to Trump-style chaos and fighting. That, several said, doesn\u2019t look like a formula for winning either. \u201cPresident Biden is the nominee and he\u2019s going to remain the nominee,\u201d said Cutter, who is on contract to produce the convention. \u201cFor those who are for looking for some sort of interparty fight, be careful what you wish for because that would ensure a Trump victory.\u201d Among some, talk has turned to just soldiering through, hoping that the polls don\u2019t show a collapse and the debate panic fades into the July 4 holiday. Biden himself claimed at a fundraiser in the Hamptons on Saturday that \u201cvoters had a different reaction than the pundits\u201d and he\u2019s seen polls that show the voters are backing him more after the debate. \u201cOne hundred percent, he\u2019s the nominee,\u201d said California Rep. Robert Garcia, an avid Biden backer. \u201cAnything else is unserious chatter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/democratic-party-replacement-worries-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_trump-new-jersey-golf-club-liquor-license", "text": "New Jersey regulators have scheduled a July 19 hearing to decide on the liquor license renewals for two of former President Donald Trump\u2019s golf clubs in the wake of his felony conviction in New York. A New Jersey\u00a0law\u00a0prohibits anyone who was convicted of a crime \u201cinvolving moral turpitude\u201d from holding a liquor license, according to a spokesperson from the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office. In May, Trump was\u00a0found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in a New York court \u2014 in an unprecedented criminal trial that made him the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. Prosecutors said he falsified records to conceal a payment made to an adult film actress to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the affair. New Jersey regulators will hold the hearing \u2014 which comes after the presumptive Republican nominee is set to be sentenced in New York on July 11 \u2014 and determine whether the liquor licenses at the golf courses in Colts Neck and Bedminster can be legally renewed. \u201cA review by ABC [Alcohol Beverage Control]\u00a0indicates that Mr. Trump maintains a direct beneficial interest in the three liquor licenses through the receipt of revenues and profits from them, as the sole beneficiary of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust,\u201d the spokesperson from the attorney general\u2019s office said. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization called the hearing \u201cunwarranted and unjustified.\u201d \u201cAs previously stated, President Trump is not the holder of any liquor license in New Jersey, and he is not an officer, director or operator of any entity that holds a liquor license in New Jersey,\u201d a statement obtained by CNN on Saturday reads. \u201cWe sincerely hope that this investigation is not political in nature, and given the foregoing, we feel confident that our licenses will remain unaffected,\u201d the statement said. The liquor licenses at the Colts Neck and Bedminster golf courses expire Sunday, and until the hearing, the clubs will be allowed to sell liquor under a state-issued temporary 90-day permit, according to the attorney general\u2019s office spokesperson. \u201cDuring such a hearing, the applicant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that they remain qualified to maintain licensure, which includes a review of any beneficiaries of the licenses,\u201d they said. The liquor license for Trump\u2019s third New Jersey golf course in Pine Hill was renewed on June 3, the spokesperson said. \u201cABC declines further comment on the status of that license pending the outcome of the hearing set for the Colts Neck and Lamington Farm Club licenses,\u201d the spokesperson said.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity", "text": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday that Donald Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took in the waning days of his presidency in a decision that will likely further delay a trial on the federal election subversion charges pending against him. In the most closely watched case before the Supreme Court this year, the ruling rejects a decision from a federal appeals court in February that found Trump enjoyed no immunity for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision was 6-3, with the court\u2019s liberals in dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a lengthy and strongly worded dissent in which she excoriated the court for its decision. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in Monday\u2019s opinion, \u201cWe conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that a former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least with respect to the President\u2019s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute.\u201d \u201cThe President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,\u201d Roberts also wrote. The chief justice said the trial court will have to assess what of Trump\u2019s alleged conduct is immunized under the new test handed down by the high court, and the opinion said that additional briefing will be needed for the trial court to do so. \u201cWe accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance \u2014 with the benefit of briefing we lack \u2014 whether Trump\u2019s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial,\u201d wrote Roberts, who said there was a lack of \u201cfactual analysis\u201d in the previous lower court opinions rejecting Trump\u2019s immunity. Justice Amy Coney Barrett expressed frustration with how the court was sending the case back down for more proceedings. \u201cI would have framed the underlying legal issues differently,\u201d Barrett wrote in a concurrence. She suggested that because Trump\u2019s wholesale challenge to the indictment had failed, at least some of the case could go forward. \u201cA President facing prosecution may challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cIf that challenge fails, however, he must stand trial,\u201d she said. She took issue with how the court had ruled that evidence from Trump\u2019s official acts should be excluded from the trial, writing that there was no reason to depart from the \u201cfamiliar and time-tested procedure\u201d that would allow for such evidence to be included. The decision was quickly welcomed by Trump, who called it a \u201cBIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY\u201d on Truth Social. His legal team says they believe it is possible that special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s\u00a0case is now completely undermined because any communication Trump had with then-Vice President Mike Pence or Department of Justice officials could be considered official, precluding it from being introduced at trial. The team also said it could even help Trump in the classified documents case, though the initial views do not necessarily mean that\u2019s how the legal process will ultimately play out. In a call with the media following the court\u2019s ruling on Monday, the Biden campaign attacked the \u201cconflicted and compromised\u201d Supreme Court, accusing the justices of handing Trump \u201cthe keys to a dictatorship.\u201d Ruling hamstrings election subversion case The Supreme Court made clear that unofficial actions do not receive immunity, and Smith has long made clear that he feels he could continue the case based on those unofficial actions. In that sense, if Smith narrowed his indictment, lower courts could hear the Trump trial this year. But the high court also left a lot of work for those lower courts to sort out what constitutes an official act versus a private one. Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to demonstrate Trump\u2019s motive and other aspects of Smith\u2019s case against Trump. Roberts wrote that the lower courts may not look into a former president\u2019s motive. \u201cCertain allegations \u2013 such as those involving Trump\u2019s discussions with the Acting Attorney General \u2013 are readily categorized in light of the nature of the president\u2019s official relationship to the office held by that individual,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cOther allegations \u2013 such as those involving Trump\u2019s interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public \u2013 present more difficult questions,\u201d Roberts wrote. But Roberts said it is lower courts that must decide whether those actions \u201care subject to immunity, that analysis ultimately is best left to the lower courts to perform in the first instance.\u201d \u2018The President is now a king above the law\u2019 Sotomayor, writing for the two other liberal justices, said the court\u2019s ruling \u201cmakes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.\u201d \u201cWhen he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cLet the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority\u2019s message today,\u201d Sotomayor also wrote. \u201cEven if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\u201d \u201cWith fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u201d Sotomayor concluded.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_trump-campaign-gop-platform", "text": "Top advisers to Donald Trump are plotting an overhaul of the Republican Party platform that will dramatically slash its size and refocus the GOP around the former president\u2019s agenda for a second term. A memo from Trump campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles dated Thursday criticized past platforms as too long and too heavily influenced by special interests and outside groups. A \u201cclear, concise and easily digestible\u201d platform will be easier for voters to understand and harder for political opponents to attack, they wrote. \u201cPublishing an unnecessarily verbose treatise will provide more fuel for our opponent\u2019s fire of misinformation and misrepresentation to voters,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIt is with that recognition that we will present a streamlined platform in line with President Trump\u2019s principled and popular vision for America\u2019s future.\u201d The memo, obtained Saturday by CNN, was first reported by The New York Times. The party\u2019s most recent platform, crafted in 2016 and reapproved in 2020, spans 66 pages. A person familiar with the planning said the goal for the upcoming platform is a concise document that is \u201ca couple dozen pages,\u201d written in clearer language and likely reflecting Trump\u2019s top priorities. That person went on to say that when platform committees convened ahead of previous conventions, their meetings were attended by lobbyists and special interest groups trying to insert specific line items for their clients into the party platform. LaCivita and Wiles wrote they want a platform that will \u201cfree our Party from the constraints of Washington jargon and the shackles of lobbyist influence.\u201d The memo comes amid intensifying anxiety from conservative groups over the direction of the platform ahead of next month\u2019s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. There is especially concern among anti-abortion groups that Thursday\u2019s memo is signaling Trump intends to remove the platform\u2019s long-standing commitment to a federal abortion ban and an amendment to the US Constitution giving the unborn the same rights as people. \u201cThe party is fully united, and taking out the pro-life language risks dividing the party,\u201d said one Trump ally who is deeply involved in the anti-abortion movement and is aware of the memo from LaCivita and Wiles. The existing platform also lays out the party\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage and new gun restrictions. It embraces changes to Medicare and Social Security for people under 55 \u2014 some of which has become fodder for Democratic messaging in recent election cycles. Trump\u2019s campaign is especially aware of how Democrats have weaponized the GOP platform in the past and is seeking to avoid a lengthy document full of potential landmines for the former president to navigate. \u201cThe platform is an opportunity to make our vision clear, and to lay out a framework for policy making, while rejecting any special interest influence that seeks to make public policy stray from our clear and straightforward objectives,\u201d LaCivita and Wiles wrote. But by laying down markers in advance of next month\u2019s convention, Trump\u2019s campaign is further asserting his dominance over a party more fully in his control. Already, Trump this year has ousted the party\u2019s previous chair, Ronna McDaniel, and installed close allies atop the GOP \u2014 his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and North Carolina GOP leader Michael Whatley. The platform committee, meanwhile, will be led by three close allies: Randy Evans, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Luxembourg; Russell Vought, a top official in the Trump administration; and Ed Martin, president of the right-wing interest group the Phyllis Schlafly Eagles and author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d That committee will meet behind closed doors ahead of the convention, which begins July 15. Unlike in previous years, its deliberations will not be broadcast by C-SPAN, a source confirmed.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_presidential-debate-trump-biden", "text": "The confrontation in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump Thursday night has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in US history. For the first time, a sitting president and an ex-president will lock horns before millions of viewers, in an encounter taking place far earlier than normal \u2014 even before the party conventions. The CNN-hosted showdown is the most pivotal moment yet in a neck-and-neck election, and it\u2019s Biden\u2019s best chance to shake up a reelection bid that he is in deep danger of losing as he struggles to convince voters that he\u2019s delivered the political and economic normality he promised in 2020. The debate comes at a moment when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices that have made it harder to feed their families and afford rents, mortgages, and new cars. It is unfolding amid an intense national debate over access to abortion that was unleashed by the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump. Deep divides over immigration and foreign policy in a world filled with new challenges to US power will form a contentious backdrop to a clash between two candidates who openly disdain one another. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract. But the momentous circumstances of the occasion can only be fully understood alongside the context of the unprecedented politics of the times. Since Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon staged\u00a0the first televised debate\u00a0in the 1960 campaign, there have been agonizingly close elections that have set the country on a sharply different course. But the stakes in 2024 are greater than ever because of Trump\u2019s attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power based on false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and his promise to wage a never-before-seen presidency of personal vengeance if he wins in November. Biden plans to frame what he sees as Trump\u2019s threat to the rule of law and democracy in the starkest terms, sources familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. He will describe the mob attack by Trump\u2019s supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201cseismic,\u201d era-defining moment that must be a watershed for voters. \u201cThe embodiment of the threat is returning,\u201d said one Biden source. That backdrop means this presidential debate has a different cast than all its predecessors. Had Sen. John Kerry beaten President George W. Bush in 2004 or ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney made President Barack Obama a one-term president in 2012, there would have been significant political change. But the character of the republic and its global posture would not have fundamentally altered. That assurance cannot be applied with any confidence to the current election. Trump\u2019s strongman impulse \u2013 epitomized by his claim before the Supreme Court that presidents have almost limitless power, as well as a blueprint for hardline new policies on immigration, the economy and foreign policy \u2013 means a second term could bring massive disruption. \u201c(It is) unbelievably historic. You cannot (over) hype up the importance of this,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Democrats are desperate for the 81-year-old Biden to put on a show of vitality and sharpness amid concerns about his age. Seventy-eight-year-old Trump\u2019s biggest liability might be himself and the possibility of a performance that could validate Biden\u2019s warnings that he\u2019s too \u201cunhinged\u201d to be president. Biden is expected to hammer Trump over abortion \u2014 one of the few policy areas where he outpolls the former president \u2014 and his admiration of foreign dictators. Trump is already signaling he\u2019ll portray Biden\u2019s America in dystopian terms, beset by uncontrolled immigration, rampant crime and searing economic pain. The most extraordinary aspect of the debate is that it takes place less than a month after Trump was convicted in a criminal hush money case in New York. Biden has already highlighted the guilty verdict in campaign events, but Trump insists that he\u2019s the victim of an attempt to weaponize the legal system to interfere in the election. Both candidates are facing extreme pressure Both men will hope to avoid the kind of debate night gaffes or odd personal quirks that have often gone viral and dominated critical post-debate media coverage that helps cement the perception of who won and who lost in voters\u2019 minds. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s theatrical sighs in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch in 1992 both became emblems of losing campaigns. The risks are now much higher because of social media. Presidential debates don\u2019t always decide who wins in November. But the tension surrounding this year\u2019s first debate in June, rather than in September or October as usual, is palpable. \u201cThe closer the election, the greater the chance that a debate could influence it,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who has conducted an in-depth study of every presidential debate. \u201cA lot of times these mistakes reaffirm a caricature of one of the particular candidates that existed before it happened.\u201d For Biden, that means no senior moments, and Trump would be advised to avoid outbursts that confirm Biden\u2019s characterization of a tyrant in waiting. Neither Trump nor Biden has debated since their final clash in the pandemic-disrupted 2020 campaign. And their preparation for one of the most important nights of their lives has reflected their character and political personas. The president has been out of sight for days, huddled below the oaks, poplars and maple trees at the Camp David retreat with advisers, strategizing how to handle the most challenging debate foe in history. Fueled by lasagna and tacos, he\u2019s taken part in mock debates, immersed himself in briefing binders and tried to anticipate Trump\u2019s wild twists and diversions. It\u2019s a debate camp in keeping with Biden\u2019s view that he\u2019s locked in an existential election duel with the soul of the nation on the line. The former president hates mock debates and has instead honed his preparation at rallies and events, trusting his instincts and intuition and a feral sense of an opponent\u2019s political weakness. He has, however, had policy refresher sessions with aides and some potential vice-presidential picks including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Biden has raised the stakes for himself heading into the debate higher than those any modern president faced. He argues Trump is a criminal in whom something has \u201csnapped\u201d and who is too dangerous and reckless to be let back into the White House. He\u2019s also rebuked Trump for using Nazi-style language and warned democracy and freedom are on the ballot along with the capacity of \u2018We the People\u2019 to shape America\u2019s destiny. Preparing for anything at Camp David Biden\u2019s debate team is led by former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation. One of Klain\u2019s mantras is \u201cwhile you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d Biden is therefore expected to front-load the most important points to appeal to the likely highest rated part of the primetime event. The Biden team has been poring over Trump\u2019s recent public interviews and speeches while workshopping responses to whatever he and the moderators may throw Biden\u2019s way. The president will be ready for whichever version of Trump shows up \u2013 whether it\u2019s the bombastic opponent who talked over and insulted him in their first clash in 2020, or a more restrained challenger seeking to project stability. If Trump aims for a presidential bearing, Biden has a locker full of practiced attacks and rebuttals designed to provoke him into making the outbursts that could turn voters off. A Biden adviser told CNN that debate preparations have included getting the president ready to respond should Trump get personal\u00a0 \u2014 weeks after his son Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges. Biden\u2019s love and protective instinct for his family is always close to the surface, and he reacted furiously when the then-president brought up Hunter during their first debate in 2020. Biden has been running through his paces inside a large hangar at the Maryland retreat, where there\u2019s a mock debate stage complete with bright television lights. His personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is playing Trump and other aides have sat in as CNN moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But sources told CNN that the debate practice was about more than feeling comfortable. It\u2019s also about answering the age question. Aides and allies of the president alike have frequently pointed to his State of the Union address in March as a model example of Biden at his best. He was energetic, focused and nimble, they\u2019ve argued, over the course of his 67-minute prime-time speech. Trump\u2019s debate prep is as unorthodox as he is Sitting presidents often have a rude awakening at first presidential debates, since they are unused to anyone getting in their grill and contradicting them. But Trump\u2019s advantage on this score may be compromised since he refused to debate any of his GOP primary rivals this year. Still, his aggressive debate style isn\u2019t much different from the belligerent, spiky attitude he displays in most public events. Trump has warmed up for the debate by suggesting that Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs, as his aides frantically have tried to dismantle the expectations trap that the ex-president constructed for himself by suggesting that Biden is so mentally diminished that he can barely stand up or finish a sentence. In any other era, the idea of a candidate accusing an opponent of doping would be unthinkable. But Trump\u2019s tactic is a reminder of a presidency and a political style that has shattered all previous norms. In a new memo on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign signaled that the ex-president would assail Biden over immigration and the economy. It boasted about polling averages that his team says show the former president up in all the key states. And Trump, whose administration created a gale of daily falsehoods, characteristically worked to accuse Biden of the very transgression that is most associated with him \u2014 lying. \u201cThe man is a walking lying machine and a fact-checker\u2019s dream,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, while accusing Biden, one of the best presidential golfers, of being unable to hit a ball 10 yards. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach means that the country may get another reminder of the chaos, discord and cacophony that it experienced in his four years in office \u2014 and that his supporters love and want to restore. But it\u2019s also a risk that could play into Biden\u2019s desire to get voters to see the contrast between the 45th and 46th presidents that he believes could deliver him the election. Former Obama speechwriter Terry Szuplat said successful debate performances tell a coherent story of where the country is and where it is going. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about yourself. Why you\u2019re the right candidate. Why the other candidate is the wrong candidate.\u00a0And it\u2019s a story about the future. Every election is about the future. It\u2019s a choice about the future,\u201d Szuplat told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. Neither Trump nor Biden has so far fulfilled that goal. Thursday is the best chance to do so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/presidential-debate-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis", "text": "The Almighty won\u2019t be standing on stage alongside Joe Biden on Thursday night. But Donald Trump will. Biden\u2019s team is seizing on the most critical presidential debate in years to spell out a contrast on character and policy that it believes will decide the 2024 election, if only voters will finally perceive it. It\u2019s the embodiment of one of Biden\u2019s own, rather defensive jokes \u2014 the idea that he doesn\u2019t need to be universally popular, just more acceptable than the other guy, who, happily for him, happens to be the most extreme ex-president of modern times. \u201cMy dad used to say, \u2018Joey, don\u2019t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative,\u2019\u201d the president has said for years at rallies. The argument is a safety net for a president with the kind of low approval ratings that would normally condemn him to a single term and who has struggled to sell his achievements to voters. Biden\u2019s team is setting up Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d and criminal agent of vengeance unfit for a return to the presidency who will only look after himself, rich friends, and anti-abortion zealots. Biden is reflected in this conceit as a bulwark of stability and a guardian of the country\u2019s democratic values who is tirelessly striving to improve workers\u2019 lives. Biden\u2019s campaign laid the groundwork for the Atlanta showdown hosted by CNN in a weekend memo. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments in this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people and Donald Trump who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of regency and retribution,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. Campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu highlighted the contrast on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe American people have to think about the wisdom, the character, and the judgment of the person that they\u2019re going to appoint to lead America not only at home but also to the rest of the world.\u201d And CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche reported Tuesday that several top Democrats outside the White House want Biden to stop trying to claim credit for his achievements \u2014 including roaring jobs growth and a strong legislative record \u2014 and to go after Trump directly. \u201cHe wants the credit, but it\u2019s not working,\u201d one top Democrat, who had shared concerns with the campaign, said. How the 2024 election is different It\u2019s not unusual for an incumbent to try to savage an opponent\u2019s character and credentials to bolster a tough reelection bid. In 2004, President George W. Bush\u2019s team slandered Democrat John Kerry\u2019s Vietnam War heroism to portray him as too weak to lead the war on terror. In 2012, President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign presented Republican nominee Mitt Romney as a rich and callous corporate shark with an empty soul who relished sacking workers. Both of those attacks worked. But this is not a conventional campaign and Trump is not a conventional candidate. Democrats have been frustrated that the ex-president\u2019s return to the political spotlight and his romp to the GOP nomination have not already cemented the comparison and rendered him politically unacceptable. And the idea that voters will finally connect the dots depends on the premise that most Americans, unlike political obsessives in the campaigns and media industries, don\u2019t think about politics and presidential elections most of the time. They just need a nudge to remind them of how things used to be, the thinking goes. If Trump rants and vents his 2020 election lies on Thursday, he will play into Biden\u2019s hands. But while the television audience will be vast, the idea that there will be a moment of national realization about Trump\u2019s perceived threat seems more suited to the age of Cronkite than the age of TikTok. Biden, whom many voters believe is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86, is also under pressure to create a vision for the future for a weary electorate tired of high prices. He must therefore project certainty, stamina and authority on his own behalf to make the comparison work. But there is a deeper issue about the president\u2019s approach. Can it really be true that, eight years after Trump won the White House and three years after his turbulent presidency ended in violence, voters don\u2019t fully understand who Trump is? His dominance of media coverage makes it seem like he never went away. And voters would have to be hugely disengaged to not know that he\u2019s a recently convicted felon, was impeached twice, refused to accept defeat in 2020, called a crowd to Washington, DC, and told followers to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before they beat up police officers and invaded the US Capitol. Trump has lost a massive civil fraud trial, been found liable for sexual assault in a defamation case and mused during the pandemic about using disinfectant to treat Covid-19 inside the body.\u00a0He spent weeks at his recent hush money trial in New York attacking judges, witnesses, the legal system and vowing to use the presidency as a vehicle of personal and political revenge if he wins a second term. But he\u2019s still locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden and has been leading in many of the critical swing states that pave the way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Biden and his fellow Democrats might see Trump as unacceptable. But he\u2019s not to millions of voters. The tied race reflects a nation split in two, politically and culturally, and is a commentary on Biden\u2019s unpopularity. And it reflects one of the most unusual aspects of this election. There are two presidents, both with a one-term record, competing for the White House. Voters don\u2019t really need to question how Trump would behave as president \u2014 they\u2019ve already seen it, even if a second term for the 45th president already looks like it would be more extreme and volatile than the first. How Trump could seek to frustrate Biden\u2019s strategy Assuming the Biden campaign sticks to this contrast strategy, Trump could thwart it by putting on a show of temperance and arriving with a list of plans to impress voters worried about their personal finances. There were isolated occasions during Trump\u2019s presidency when he met expectations of decorum. Karl Rove, the architect of Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection victory, wrote in his Wall Street Journal column last week that \u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t come off as unhinged or enraged. The words \u2018rigged election\u2019 shouldn\u2019t pass his lips. He has to keep his cool and can\u2019t make it all about himself.\u201d That\u2019s shrewd advice but Trump almost never behaves that way. Some of the former president\u2019s supporters have been transmitting advice on TV. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, for instance, said on NBC over the weekend that the debate would be a \u201cgreat opportunity for President Trump to talk about \u2026 how his policies when he served as president of this country were good for every single family that lived here. They had more money in their pockets. The grocery prices were down. Gas prices were down.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that he has to get personal in this debate at all.\u201d The former president has taken part in multiple policy sessions with supporters despite his disdain for formal debate practice. But the script often gets tossed out when he goes live. The unusual circumstances of Thursday\u2019s debate could work in Trump\u2019s favor. Microphones will be muted to ensure both candidates can use their time without interruptions. That could avoid the mayhem of the first Trump v. Biden debate in 2020. The then-president\u2019s feverish demeanor was partly explained days later when he was rushed to hospital with a serious case of Covid-19. But Biden\u2019s admonition, \u201cShut up, man!\u201d gave voice to voters tired of four years of Trumpian cacophony. In another break from previous years, there will be no live audience for the debate inside a CNN studio in Atlanta. Often, Trump\u2019s most extreme rhetoric erupts when he works a crowd and doubles down on comments that get a strong reaction. Still, the encounter will mark the ex-president\u2019s reacquaintance with an opponent he blames for what he falsely claims is a campaign of persecution that threatens his fortune and his liberty. And Trump hasn\u2019t exactly been strategic ahead of the debate. His campaign has spent days trying to roll back his expectations of Biden as a doddering, elderly president who can\u2019t string two words together. Now, his team is insisting Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs. After months of suggesting Biden is too senile to serve, the Trump campaign\u2019s strategy now seems illogical as it paints a picture of a supreme debater who, by implication, would seem to be of presidential timber. Trump senior advisor Jason Miller, for instance, said on Tuesday, \u201cWe know that when it comes to the big events, when it comes to debates, when it comes to State of the Union, things of that nature, that they\u2019re going to have Joe Biden completely super soldiered up.\u201d Miller added: \u201cHe is going to be ready to go. He has a certain muscle memory that kicks in for having done this for 50 years.\u201d Democrats will be hoping that\u2019s true and that he can live up to the contrast with his rival staked out by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a two-day swing through battleground Wisconsin. Biden, she said, is \u201ca good and decent man who will protect freedom for women across this country and who is fighting to lower costs for working families.\u201d Warren added, \u201cLet Donald Trump be Donald Trump, the guy who panders to an extremist base and who has said to his rich as hell donors that if they\u2019ll just put more money into his campaign, he\u2019ll give them giant tax cuts and cut back regulations on climate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_final-rulings-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its final opinions of the term on Monday morning, resolving the question of whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. Overstepping their unofficial end-of-June deadline by a single day, the nine justices will assemble on the bench for a final time before rising for their summer recess \u2013 likely leaving in their wake a flurry of legal wrangling over their last decisions. By far, the case of greatest consequence that is still outstanding is the question of whether Trump is entitled to the sweeping immunity he is seeking from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. Trump has argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second-guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April. The answer to the question could have profound implications for both Trump and future presidents. During the CNN debate on Thursday, Trump claimed President Joe Biden \u201ccould be a convicted felon with all of the things that he\u2019s done.\u201d That answer came in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about whether Trump would seek retribution from his political opponents. Trump first responded by saying his \u201cretribution is going to be success,\u201d but then launched into a series of accusations against Biden. The immunity case appears likely to come down to whether Trump\u2019s post-election actions were \u201cofficial\u201d \u2013 that is, steps pursuant to his presidential duties \u2013 or whether they were \u201cprivate,\u201d which would not likely receive immunity. The court will also decide two cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. At issue are laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like\u202fFacebook and X from throttling\u202fconservative views. The state laws ban online platforms from removing or demoting posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives. In some ways, the underlying dispute isn\u2019t as salient as it might have been when the cases were first filed. Since Elon Musk bought X and changed the company\u2019s content moderation policies, conservatives have been less likely to accuse the social media giant of throttling their views. But the case nevertheless raised fundamental First Amendment questions that could have a broad impact. At the center of both disputes is whether the curation of posts is protected speech \u2013 in the same way that news outlets are entitled to First Amendment protection in how they design their front pages or guest lineups \u2013 or whether the social media platforms are simply carrying third-party posts to readers in a way that would allow the government to regulate them more closely. A final case to be decided deals with a North Dakota truck stop that is challenging the fees banks can charge for debit card transactions in a ruling that could have deeper implications for other government regulations. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether the truck stop may sue in the first place, given a six-year statute of limitations on challenging government regulations. It\u2019s a technical question but with potentially important ramifications. The federal government has warned that if the court sides with the truck stop, it could open the floodgates for similar challenges to government rules. The decisions will cap a term in which the high court has largely ducked the underlying questions of two major abortion matters. It has sided with the Biden administration on one gun regulation and tossed out a federal ban on bump stocks in another. On Friday, the court narrowed a charge prosecutors had filed against hundreds of people who took part in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Beyond the decisions, the court\u2019s term was also plagued by controversy off the bench, including a series of stories documenting that controversial flags \u2013 including an upside-down US flag \u2013 had flown at properties owned by Justice Samuel Alito. An activist who\u202frepresented herself as a religious conservative at a Supreme Court event released secret recordings of Alito and his wife, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, discussing a range of politically sensitive topics. Finally, in a stunning breach of protocol, the court inadvertently posted a draft of its opinion in a major abortion case a day before the formal release. In that case, the court dismissed a fight between Idaho and the Biden administration over the state\u2019s strict abortion ban, temporarily blocking that ban\u2019s enforcement in emergency health situations while the underlying litigation continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/final-rulings-supreme-court/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_joe-biden-immunity-supreme-court", "text": "President Joe Biden on Monday condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s decision which ruled that presidents have an absolute immunity from prosecution for core official acts, and issued a stern warning over a possible second term for former President Donald Trump. \u201cThere are no kings in America. Each, each of us is equal before the law. No one, no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,\u201d Biden said in a speech from the White House. \u201c(With) today\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed. For all practical purposes, there are virtually no limits on what the president can do. It\u2019s a fundamentally new principle and it\u2019s a dangerous precedent because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law even including the supreme court of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision along ideological lines,\u00a0ruled\u00a0that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president before leaving office, likely delaying his federal election subversion trial related to his actions on January 6 even further. The\u00a0ruling\u00a0rejects a decision from a federal appeals court in February that found the former president enjoyed no immunity for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. Biden repeatedly warned that the limits of the president\u2019s power now solely rest with the holder of the office and the choices that person makes. He said Trump would be a danger in that role. The notably political speech comes at a critical moment for Biden\u2019s campaign as he tries to beat back persistent concerns about his age exacerbated by his performance in last week\u2019s presidential debate. His unsteady performance wreaked anxiety among some of his top donors and raised uncomfortable questions for Democrats about whether he should remain on their ticket, much less serve another four years in the White House. During Monday\u2019s speech, Biden appeared alert, reading energetically from a teleprompter in the Cross Hall of the White House. But he did not take questions, immediately walking away after his five-minute, scripted statement. On Monday, Biden referenced the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and called it \u201cone of the darkest days in the history of America.\u201d He said the court\u2019s decision has made it unlikely that Trump will face trial for his criminal charges related to that riot before the election. The court\u2019s decision technically allows special counsel Jack Smith to move forward with his election subversion case against Trump, but left many technical questions unresolved \u2013 making it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. Smith\u2019s case now returns to lower courts, which must review the specific steps Trump took to overturn the results of the 2020 election and whether those actions were official, and therefore receive immunity, or private, and do not. The majority said that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Justice Department \u2013 his efforts to try to get officials on board with his attempt to overturn the election \u2013 were covered with absolute immunity. For other official actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there is at least some immunity and it largely deferred to lower courts to sort that out. That\u2019s a process that could take weeks or even months. Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to prevail. Chief Justice John Roberts also wrote that the lower courts may not consider a former president\u2019s motive, which may allow Trump\u2019s attorneys to argue that he wasn\u2019t attempting to overturn an election in his favor at all. \u201cI know I will respect the limits of the presidential powers I\u2019ve had for three-and-a-half years, but any president \u2013 including Donald Trump \u2013 will now be free to ignore the law,\u201d Biden said. Biden, who has made protecting democracy a central tenet of his campaign, described the decision as a broader pattern from the Supreme Court in undermining \u201ca wide range of long-established legal principles,\u201d pointing to other decisions on voting rights and civil rights as he implicitly laid out the stakes for the presidential election. He added that voters now hold the ultimate say over holding Trump accountable. \u201cThe American people must decide if they want to entrust \u2026 the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing that he\u2019ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it.\u201d He added, \u201cI concur with Justice (Sonia) Sotomayor\u2019s dissent today. Here\u2019s what she said \u2013 she said, \u2018In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u2019 end of quote. So should the American people dissent. I dissent.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s decision had an instant effect \u2013 Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial based on the high court\u00a0ruling on presidential immunity, a source told CNN. Trump\u2019s lawyer filed a letter with Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan seeking permission to file a motion to challenge the verdict, the source said. If the judge allows Trump to file the motion it could delay Trump\u2019s sentencing \u2013 set for next week \u2013 to allow the parties to brief the issue. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0did not file its sentencing submission Monday as expected, according to a source. CNN\u2019s John Fritze and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_supreme-court-dissents-sotomayor-kagan-jackson", "text": "As the conservative Supreme Court majority has won case after case in recent days, liberal dissenters\u00a0are having\u00a0their moment in the courtroom. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson each took\u00a0the rare step of reading provocative dissenting statements this past week.\u00a0The ritual from the elevated mahogany bench offered a bit of drama before rapt courtroom spectators and a chance to draw public attention to their views. In\u00a0the face of the conservative dominance, it was the best they could do. After Justice Neil Gorsuch on Friday announced the\u00a06-3 decision letting an Oregon city ticket homeless people\u00a0for sleeping outside,\u00a0Sotomayor spoke up. \u201cSleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\u201d she said, reading from notes before her. Observing that the city of Grants Pass arrests and fines people for sleeping in public, even if there\u2019s no available shelter bed, Sotomayor said the law \u201cpunishes them for being homeless.\u201d Gorsuch, who sits at Sotomayor\u2019s immediate right on the bench, kept his head turned toward\u00a0her, listening impassively. Other justices stared out at spectators or down at notes, perhaps anticipating the next opinions, and dissents, to be revealed. Protracted, bluntly worded dissents from the bench \u2013 a singular practice taken at the end of an annual court session when the toughest cases come down \u2013 are mainly wielded these days by the liberals. They have been more loudly trumpeting their differences with the right-wing majority, whether in the courtroom or confined to the page. Oral dissents add no legal weight to what\u2019s written in a dissenting opinion. Still, they give the generally cloistered justices a way to amplify gripes with the majority \u2013 notwithstanding the sedate setting of the courtroom. Following the decision on homeless encampments Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts announced a decision\u00a0significantly curtailing the power of federal regulators\u00a0and enhancing the authority of judges, again by a 6-3 vote. That prompted dissenting Kagan to denounce the \u201cmassive shock\u201d to today\u2019s complex federal system that regulates air and water pollution, keeps drugs safe, and protects consumer and investor interests. The court majority reversed a 1984 milestone that required judges to defer to\u00a0reasonable\u00a0agency interpretations of their congressional mandates. That case,\u00a0which Congress, executive branch agencies and the judiciary followed for 40 years, reflected the widespread understanding that\u00a0statutes\u00a0are often ambiguous and that agencies, with their expertise, were best suited to interpret them. Her\u00a0oral dissent lasted nearly 15 minutes, about five minutes longer than Roberts\u2019 rendition of the majority opinion. As she spoke, Roberts gazed downward. The targets of oral dissents seldom react or subtly reveal any sentiment. They\u2019ve won. Kagan\u2019s zingers extended to her written opinion.\u00a0\u201cIn one fell swoop, the majority today gives itself exclusive power over every open issue \u2013 no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden,\u201d Kagan wrote, adding, \u201cIf opinions had titles, a good candidate for today\u2019s would be Hubris Squared.\u201d The majority\u2019s reversal of the 1984 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council marked the third time in three years that conservatives had reversed\u00a0foundational, decades-old\u00a0precedent. Last year, it overturned a 1978 case allowing racial affirmative action in college admissions. In 2022, it threw out\u00a0the\u00a01973\u00a0Roe v. Wade\u00a0decision giving women the constitutional right to end a pregnancy. \u2018Tough luck\u2019 Bench announcements occur in the courtroom, without cameras or audio access. They begin with the author of the majority opinion delivering the facts of the case, law involved, and the resolution. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although some justices, notably Roberts and Kagan, tend to incorporate some suspense and occasional levity. An oral dissent is necessarily more impassioned. In Friday\u2019s homelessness dispute, the Gorsuch majority ruled that enforcement of bans on camping on public property against homeless people do not violate the 8th\u00a0Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Gorsuch said the dilemma of homelessness is a complex matter for policymakers and elected officials, not judges. \u201cAt bottom,\u201d he wrote in his opinion, \u201cthe question this case presents is whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges primary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising the responses. It does not.\u201d His\u00a0courtroom tone was as calm and steady as Sotomayor\u2019s was emphatic. Sotomayor\u00a0closed by referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s obligation to safeguard constitutional rights for all Americans, rich and poor, \u201cespecially when doing so is uncomfortable or unpopular.\u201d The day before, Sotomayor had also read an\u00a0oral dissent \u00a0to protest a decision by the six-justice conservative majority that curtailed the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce fraud regulations. The ruling eliminated the ability of the SEC and other agencies to resolve claims with internal administrative hearings, rather than go to federal court. The message from the court to agencies losing a crucial enforcement tool, Sotomayor asserted in the courtroom: \u201cTough luck. Get a new statute from Congress.\u201d The newest justice joins in There was a time when conservative dissenters were heard more frequently in the white marble setting, up until recent years as the controlling right-wing supermajority coalesced. Justice Antonin Scalia, who served\u00a0from 1986 until his death in\u00a02016, took advantage of the practice with his theatrical flair and confrontational style. Now, oral dissents have become the exclusive tool of the left wing, even in cases when some conservatives lose, too. On Thursday, Jackson, the court\u2019s newest justice and its first African American woman, condemned the majority\u2019s dismissal of an Idaho abortion dispute.\u00a0The majority had engineered\u00a0a cross-ideological\u00a0and\u00a0politically expedient compromise,\u00a0ending\u00a0the case\u00a0for the time being. Jackson said the court should have been able to resolve the conflict over reproductive care that began in Idaho but is emerging in other states that banned abortion after the justices reversed the constitutional right. From her freshman seat at the far end of the bench, Jackson said the court had\u00a0a chance to bring clarity and certainty to a tragic situation but had \u201csquandered it.\u201d The disputed Idaho abortion ban allowed an exception only to prevent the pregnant woman\u2019s death, in conflict with a 1986 federal law requiring hospitals to provide treatment to \u201cstabilize\u201d needy patients. The US Justice Department argued that Idaho women suffering serious complications from a pregnancy and requiring an abortion to preserve their health should be covered by that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The case had seemed destined for some sort of compromise in this fractious election year. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with Jackson, Sotomayor and Kagan, appeared more concerned about access to emergency reproductive care than their five male colleagues during oral arguments. In their private deliberations, the justices may have remained initially divided along those gender lines, or possibly along the familiar conservative-liberal divide. Whatever the rift, Barrett, Roberts and other justices bridged the gap. The majority said the case had been \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d and sent it back to lower courts for further proceedings. Jackson, along with three dissenters on the far-right, suggested their colleagues had engaged in a fiction regarding disputed facts to insist on dismissal. (Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Gorsuch, wrote that, \u201cThis about-face is baffling.\u201d Alito noted that the court majority had let the state\u2019s abortion ban take effect, indicating under the justices\u2019 usual standards that Idaho had a \u201cstrong\u201d likelihood of success in its dispute with the Biden administration.) But only Jackson declared her dissent from the bench. She closed her remarks, as well as her written opinion, by chiding her colleagues for putting off the case. She said pregnant patients in Idaho and elsewhere would pay the price for their inaction. \u201cWe owe them,\u201d she said, \u201can answer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/supreme-court-dissents-sotomayor-kagan-jackson/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_why-student-loan-payments-are-paused-for-3-million-borrowers", "text": "A federal appeals court will allow the Department of Education to proceed with lowering millions of student loan borrowers\u2019 monthly payments in July as the Biden administration faces two legal battles over the repayment plan known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), which launched last year. Two groups of Republican-led states filed lawsuits earlier this year challenging the SAVE plan, arguing that the administration does not have the legal authority to implement the plan. Missouri and Kansas judges issued temporary injunctions last week, halting parts of the SAVE plan while the matter can be fully litigated. SAVE lowers enrolled borrowers\u2019 monthly payments and provides a faster route to debt forgiveness. It was launched by the Biden administration after the president\u2019s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program was struck down by the Supreme Court last summer. The Missouri judge blocked the Biden administration from canceling any more student loan debt under the SAVE plan. And the Kansas judge said that the Biden administration would not be allowed to fully phase in the SAVE plan in July and lower payments by as much as half for some enrolled borrowers. The Department of Justice appealed both injunctions. On Sunday, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the Biden administration can go ahead and lower monthly student loan payments this month as originally scheduled. The appeals court did not overrule the injunction but allows this part of the plan to take effect while the matter is litigated. Here\u2019s what borrowers need to know: Payments paused for some borrowers enrolled in SAVE Nearly 8 million people are enrolled in SAVE, and roughly 3 million of them were expecting to see lower payments as of July 1 when the SAVE plan was fully phased in. After the injunctions were put in place last week, the Department of Education said that those 3 million borrowers would be put in a forbearance \u2013 during which payments would not be required and interest would not accrue \u2013 while the matter was litigated. But after the appeals court sided with the Biden administration on Sunday, the Department of Education can move ahead and make those reductions. Some affected borrowers had not yet been placed in a forbearance. If those borrowers already received a bill from their loan servicer that reflects the new, lower payment for July, they should make that payment. Those borrowers who were put in a forbearance last week due to the injunction will remain in a payment pause in July and be required to make their new, lower monthly payment starting in August. About 4 million other borrowers enrolled in SAVE already have a $0 monthly payment. SAVE is an income-driven repayment plan, which calculates payments based on a borrower\u2019s income and family size. Payments can be as low as $0 for people earning $30,000 or less a year. Student debt forgiveness under SAVE halted Borrowers enrolled in SAVE may be eligible for student debt relief in a shorter amount of time than under other income-driven repayment plans. Those who borrowed $12,000 or less will see their debt forgiven after paying for just 10 years under SAVE. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount would add one year of monthly payments to the required time a borrower must pay. Under other repayment plans, borrowers must make at least 20 years of payments before receiving debt forgiveness. To date, $5.5 billion has been canceled for 414,000 people enrolled in SAVE. But the Missouri court\u2019s injunction that remains in place blocks the Biden administration from canceling anymore student debt under SAVE until the matter is fully litigated. Online access to SAVE application will be restored When the injunctions were put in place last week, the Department of Education took down the online application for any income-driven repayment plans, including SAVE, so that it could update its systems to reflect the injunctions. As of July 1, the department said it is working on reinstating the online application. The Department of Education said that borrowers should check in regularly with\u00a0studentaid.gov\u00a0and subscribe here to receive the latest information. How does SAVE work? Like existing income-driven repayment plans, SAVE offers lower monthly payments for people with lower incomes. But the SAVE plan offers the most generous terms. SAVE lowers monthly payments in two ways compared with other federal student loan repayment plans. First, it recalculates discretionary income so that it\u2019s equal to the difference between a borrower\u2019s adjusted gross income and 225% of the poverty level. Existing income-driven plans calculate discretionary income as the difference between income and 150% of the poverty level. Under most income-driven repayment plans, borrowers are required to pay 10% of their discretionary income. But borrowers enrolled in SAVE will see those payments cut by as much as half in July. Payments on loans borrowed for undergraduate school will be reduced from 10% to 5% of discretionary income. Borrowers who have loans from both undergraduate and\u00a0graduate school will pay a weighted average of between 5% and 10% of their income based upon the original principal balances of their loans. The SAVE plan also prevents balances from ballooning due to interest when a borrower has a small monthly payment. If enrolled in SAVE, unpaid interest does not accrue if a borrower makes a fully monthly payment. For example, if $50 in interest accumulates each month and a borrower\u2019s full required payment is just $30, the remaining $20 would be waived. Confusion for borrowers The court injunctions impacting the SAVE plan come at a time when many borrowers were already experiencing issues with their student loan payments \u2013 which resumed last fall after a three-plus year pause during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some borrowers were recently put in an administrative forbearance because their accounts were being transferred from one loan servicer to another. Others were being put in a forbearance because the recalculation of their payments under SAVE had not been completed yet. \u201cThis may just be politics to the leaders of Missouri and Kansas, but for 40 million people trying to manage their student loans, it\u2019s chaos,\u201d Abby Shafroth, co-director of Advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_takeaways-trump-immunity-scotus", "text": "The Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision Monday granting Donald Trump partial immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case, handing the former president a significant win during his reelection bid. Though the 6-3 ruling technically allows Smith to inch the prosecution toward resolution, the majority opinion from Chief Justice John Roberts left many technical questions unresolved \u2013 making it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. \u201cThe president is not above the law,\u201d Roberts wrote for the conservative majority. \u201cBut Congress may not criminalize the president\u2019s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the executive branch under the Constitution.\u201d Smith\u2019s case now returns to lower courts, which must review the specific steps Trump took to overturn the results of the 2020 election and whether those actions were official, and therefore receive immunity, or private, and do not. Here\u2019s a look at the key takeaways from a historic decision: Trump got a bigger win than expected In several key respects, Trump got what he wanted from the 6-3 court \u2013 and more. For starters, the Supreme Court ruled that for \u201ccore\u201d presidential activity, Trump has the absolute immunity he had sought.\u00a0The majority said that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Justice Department \u2013 his efforts to try to get officials on board with his effort to overturn the election \u2013 were covered with absolute immunity. For other official actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there is at least some immunity and it largely deferred to lower courts to sort that out. That\u2019s a process that could take weeks or even months. The analysis about what\u2019s immune and what isn\u2019t \u201cultimately is best left to the lower courts to perform,\u201d Roberts wrote. Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to prevail. Roberts also wrote that the lower courts may not consider a former president\u2019s motive, which may allow Trump\u2019s attorneys to argue that the he wasn\u2019t attempting to overturn an election in his favor at all. What\u2019s next in the federal case against Trump? With the justices giving the lower courts some limited guidance, the next steps are likely to be more hearings, written arguments and even proceedings with witness testimony and debates over evidence before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC. Those are likely to come in the days after the Supreme Court hands the opinion down formally to the federal courts in DC. The mechanism for sending a case back down usually takes about as long as a month, but the high court could act more quickly. Once Chutkan works through the legal issues, it\u2019s possible that more appeals of her preliminary decisions could put the case on hold again \u2013 adding in significant delay. Liberals tear into majority for creating \u2018a king above the law\u2019 The court\u2019s three liberal justices pulled no punches, with two written dissents excoriating the majority opinion as an appalling affront to the nation\u2019s long-held principle that no one is above the law. That principle, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, was washed away by a ruling that means that in \u201cevery use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\u201d Joined in full by the court\u2019s two other liberal members, Sotomayor, the court\u2019s senior liberal, wrote that the majority was relying on \u201cmisguided wisdom\u201d to give Trump \u201call the immunity he asked for and more.\u201d She was especially critical of the decision to not allow prosecutors to use anything done by Trump that is shielded by immunity as they try to convince a jury to convict him over unofficial acts. \u201cThat holding,\u201d the justice said, \u201cis nonsensical.\u201d Sotomayor went on to list \u201cnightmare scenarios\u201d involving illegal conduct by a future president that would, she argued, be shielded from criminal prosecution under the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cOrders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune,\u201d she wrote. Sotomayor took the rare step of reading her dissent from the bench on Monday in a move that underscored how aggrieved the liberal bloc of the court is. \u201cWith fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u201d she wrote at the end of her 30-page dissent. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned a solo dissent in which the court\u2019s newest member said the majority ruling \u201cbreaks new and dangerous ground\u201d by granting immunity \u201conly to the most powerful official in our government.\u201d Trump\u2019s nominee Barrett pushes for a swift trial Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Trump\u2019s last appointee to the high court before leaving office, expressed frustration with how the court was sending the case back to lower courts for more proceedings and more delay in a short concurrence that failed to gain support from any of her colleagues. In a significant break from the court\u2019s other conservatives, Barrett seemed to suggest Trump should go to trial quickly. \u201cI would have framed the underlying legal issues differently,\u201d Barrett said. She suggested that because Trump\u2019s wholesale challenge to the indictment had failed, at least some of the case could go forward. The conservative justice wrote that \u201ca President facing prosecution may challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment.\u201d \u201cIf that challenge fails, however, he must stand trial,\u201d Barrett wrote. The justice took issue with how the court had ruled that evidence from Trump\u2019s official acts should be excluded from the trial, writing that there was no reason to depart from the \u201cfamiliar and time-tested procedure\u201d that would allow for such evidence to be included. Posterity vs. Trump There was a clear tension through the course of the case between justices who wanted to limit the decision to the facts surrounding Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election and the broader concerns about presidential immunity for all future presidents. In the end, Roberts repeatedly framed the court\u2019s decision as one made for posterity rather than any single president. The immunity the court found, he wrote, \u201capplies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party.\u201d The immunity case, he wrote, \u201cposes a question of lasting significance.\u201d In answering that question, he said, \u201cwe cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies.\u201d But given the timing, it was unlikely to be viewed that way by many Americans. The decision landed in the middle of a presidential election featuring the first former president ever convicted of a felony crime. \u201cOn purely partisan lines, the Supreme Court today for the first time in history places presidents substantially above the law,\u201d said David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union who has repeatedly argued before the justices. \u201cThe opinion also sits like a loaded weapon for Trump to abuse in the pursuit of criminal ends if he is reelected.\u201d Justice Thomas questions the constitutionality of  Smith\u2019s appointment Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas added a concurrence to raise questions about whether Attorney General Merrick Garland violated the Constitution when he appointed Smith as special counsel. Pushing the\u00a0fringe legal theory\u00a0about the legality of Smith\u2019s appointment in 2022 has been part of Trump\u2019s defense strategy in his classified documents criminal case in Florida, which also was brought by the special counsel. Trump\u2019s attorneys have argued that Garland does not have legal authority to appoint someone as special counsel who hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate. Thomas, too, appears to support that argument. \u201cAnd, there are serious questions whether the Attorney General has violated that structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law. Those questions must be answered before this prosecution can proceed,\u201d Thomas wrote in his concurrence.\u00a0\u201cThe lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment before proceeding.\u201d One loss for Trump: Impeachment isn\u2019t a legal shield Trump has also argued that he should be immune from prosecution since he was previously impeached and acquitted by the Senate, therefore creating a double jeopardy situation. But in one rare win for the special counsel, the court said that argument had no merit. Addressing Trump\u2019s claims, Roberts wrote that a president who evades impeachment for one reason or another,\u201d such as by resigning from office before an impeachment proceeding got underway, would \u201cnever be held accountable for his criminal acts.\u201d \u201cImpeachment is a political process by which Congress can remove a president,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cTransforming that political process into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the constitution or the structure of our government.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_trump-debate-momentum-convention", "text": "As nerves grew in the lead-up to\u00a0the\u00a0first general election\u00a0debate\u00a0of the cycle, some close to Donald Trump considered whether the former president might announce his running mate from the stage or shortly thereafter, should the evening take an unfavorable turn. The wild-card scenario was one of several ideas for post-debate distractions batted around by Trump allies still rattled from the Republican\u2019s uncontrolled first debate appearance in 2020. But that card would ultimately be left in the deck. Rather than managing fallout over Trump\u2019s performance\u00a0at Thursday\u2019s event, the former president and his team now face an unexpected challenge: keeping the attention on President Joe Biden\u00a0while navigating a busy sprint to next month\u2019s Republican National Convention, a time during which Trump will be sentenced for his felony convictions and must pick a running mate. The confidence-shattering struggles of the 81-year-old incumbent have swallowed up the post-debate discourse, and the Democratic hand-wringing over the presumptive nominee\u2019s capacity to fight on threatens to overshadow Biden\u2019s campaign for the foreseeable future. Taking a victory lap from a rally in Chesapeake, Virginia,\u00a0on Friday,\u00a0Trump called Biden \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d while poking fun at the president\u2019s weeklong debate prep at Camp David. \u201cHe studied so hard that he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing,\u201d Trump said. Behind the scenes, Trump\u2019s advisers are plotting how best to wield Biden\u2019s underwhelming display to maximum effect in hopes of shifting momentum in a race unmoved for months by external forces. Asked whether clips of Biden from Thursday night would make their way into upcoming ads, Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita\u00a0told Fox News: \u201cDuh.\u201d Trump offered a deeper glimpse into their thinking at Friday\u2019s campaign stop, limiting his attacks on Biden\u2019s appearance and insisting his opponent\u2019s age wasn\u2019t a factor in the outcome of the debate. The remarks in Virginia\u00a0closely aligned with the messaging that allies have urged Trump to adhere to as the candidates inch closer to November. \u201cNo amount of rest or rigging could help him defend his atrocious record,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not defensible.\u201d Yet, even as he seeks to keep the spotlight on Biden\u2019s debate shortcomings, Trump is also entering a critical three-week stretch full of potential race-defining moments that could further alter the stakes of the election. On Monday, the US Supreme Court is expected to decide whether the former president has absolute immunity from crimes he may have committed while in office. The ruling could determine the fate of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s case against Trump on election subversion charges. Trump\u2019s team celebrated the legal and political implications of a separate ruling Friday from the high court that determined federal prosecutors overstepped by charging hundreds of January 6, 2021, rioters with obstruction \u2013 an allegation Smith has also levied against the former president. Though unlikely to significantly alter Trump\u2019s case, Trump\u2019s team plans to campaign on the decision to bolster his baseless claims that Biden\u2019s Department of Justice is targeting his Republican predecessor and his supporters. Then,\u00a0on July 11, Trump is scheduled to be sentenced for the 34 felony convictions handed to him last month by a Manhattan jury. The judge in the case has discretion to hit\u00a0the former president\u00a0with a range of punishments, from community service and probation to fines and even jail time. The Republican convention in Milwaukee will kick off a mere four days later.\u00a0And at some point before Trump accepts his party\u2019s nomination\u00a0there\u00a0on July 18, he will also have to choose a running mate, a decision made less urgent \u2013 though no less momentous \u2013 by Thursday\u2019s debate. Leveraging these moments presents opportunities for Trump to seize media coverage beyond\u00a0the\u00a0debate and further bolster\u00a0his\u00a0campaign coffers. Before the debate\u00a0had even ended, Trump\u2019s campaign sent supporters a text message declaring he had \u201cobliterated\u201d Biden along with a link to purchase new apparel.\u00a0In the hours after Trump left the\u00a0stage, his team has contemplated how to\u00a0continue cashing in\u00a0as they relish in the Democratic panic over Biden\u2019s appearance. Trump\u2019s campaign also anticipates next month\u2019s sentencing will bring another wave of donations related to his legal troubles after he raised more than $50 million online in the 24 hours following his conviction, eroding Biden\u2019s cash advantage. The GOP convention, traditionally a defining political and financial marker in presidential campaigns, is expected to bring in more as well. That has left the question of when to unveil his pick for vice president. Trump\u2019s top advisers were\u00a0dismissive of speculation that an announcement could come during debate week. However, those same people have argued that Trump may make his selection before the convention, with some telling CNN they expect it\u2019s more likely than not that his decision comes earlier than his self-imposed timeframe of announcing his choice in Milwaukee. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the opinion that this decision would come before the convention,\u201d one Trump ally said. \u201cThey want to fundraise the hell out of this announcement, and picking a VP is in and of itself its own moment.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, appear eager to shift the conversation\u00a0from the debate to the looming Republican veepstakes. The party has spent weeks poring over the backgrounds of the potential contenders, publicizing their past positions on abortion and splicing up clips of their previous criticism of Trump. After Thursday\u2019s\u00a0event, the Democratic National Committee blasted one of the leading contenders for the job, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, for defending Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to say he would accept the November election results. Burgum, in an interview with NBC from the debate spin room, repeated Trump\u2019s conspiracies about the 2020 election. \u201cJust like the rest of Trump\u2019s VP contenders, Burgum is ready and willing to push Trump\u2019s dangerous attacks on our democracy and sell out our basic values as Americans if it helps him join Trump\u2019s losing ticket in November,\u201d DNC spokesperson Alex Floyd said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/trump-debate-momentum-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_democrats-down-ballot-debate-fallout-biden", "text": "Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat whose seat is crucial to maintaining his party\u2019s slim Senate majority in November, faced a new attack ad Sunday from GOP challenger Dave McCormick\u2019s campaign \u2014 one that Republicans across the country could emulate. Casey, the McCormick ad claims, knew of President Joe Biden\u2019s status, and stood by the president anyway. The 35-second video features clips of Democratic operatives lamenting Biden\u2019s poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week \u2014 and then features Casey publicly proclaiming that Biden is up for the job if he wins a second term. It ends with text across the screen: \u201cWhen will Casey finally tell the truth?\u201d Casey, campaigning in Scranton on Monday, stood by Biden. \u201cHe had a bad night and debate, but I think people know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he told reporters. The McCormick video was an early glimpse at a new strategy House and Senate Republican groups have started to deploy as the consequences of the president\u2019s shaky debate performance ripple through House, Senate and governor\u2019s races across the country. Republicans are eager to turn the 81-year-old president\u2019s struggles into an anvil, while Democrats gingerly navigate the most precarious moment to date in their bid to maintain control of the Senate and flip the GOP\u2019s slim House majority this fall. In the aftermath of Biden\u2019s Thursday night debacle, Democratic members of Congress have largely stood behind the president in public. That could change \u2013 very quickly \u2013 if post-debate polling and research show that Biden\u2019s debate fallout is likely to cost Democrats the House come November. \u201cThe firewall is Congress. We need to have one of the bodies,\u201d a Democratic congressman, who only agreed to speak anonymously, told CNN. This lawmaker said he and his colleagues would feel compelled to speak out \u2013 in a way they have not so far \u2013 and call on Biden to drop out if data comes out that shows: \u201cShit, he\u2019s not just going to lose the presidency, but he\u2019s going to lose the House.\u201d As CNN has reported, Biden and his team have been collecting and awaiting data \u2013 both anecdotal and public polling \u2013 as well as bracing for a broader round of Democratic campaign polling and research to get a clearer sense of the post-debate damage. If the dam is still holding among Democratic lawmakers who have declined to publicly call on Biden to leave the race, then privately, elected officials \u2013 everyone from leadership to the rank-and-file members of Congress \u2013 are actively discussing a range of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, sources said. CNN reached out to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, for comment. In private chats, lawmakers are discussing familiar Democratic names like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others as possible replacements for Biden. They are also intensely sensitive about outright dismissing Vice President Kamala Harris, and the anger that the scenario of passing over the country\u2019s first Black female vice president would unleash. Those floated prospects have been sensitive about being seen as publicly nudging Biden to exit the 2024 race. Whitmer on Monday pushed back on a Politico report that she\u2019d told Biden campaign co-chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon that Biden could no longer win Michigan \u2014 a must-win swing state for Democrats. \u201cAnyone who claims I would say that we can\u2019t win Michigan is full of shit,\u201d Whitmer said on X. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat in a deep-red state whose name is also in the mix of potential replacements and future presidential contenders, told reporters in his home state Monday that Biden\u2019s performance in the debate was \u201crough\u201d \u2013 but insisted that he still backed the president. \u201cIt was a very bad night for the president,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cBut he is still the candidate. Only he can make decisions about his future candidacy. So as long as he continues to be in the race, I support him.\u201d Republicans on the attack The National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a video on social media interspersing endangered Democratic incumbents\u2019 comments supporting Biden with some of the president\u2019s worst moments in the debate. \u201cDemocrats 2024: Don\u2019t believe your lying eyes,\u201d the Senate GOP campaign arm said in a post accompanying the video. Jack Pandol, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a memo Monday that the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm\u00a0is preparing to take aim at Democrats \u201cfor gaslighting their own voters and refusing to take responsibility for the crisis the country now finds itself in.\u201d The NRCC dispatched trackers \u2014 staffers who record video of lawmakers and candidates and sometimes pose their own questions \u2014 to the US Capitol complex and airports in Washington and endangered Democrats\u2019 home districts to pose questions about Biden\u2019s fitness. Pandol\u2019s memo also highlighted the House\u2019s partisan vote last month to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews with former special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden\u2019s handling of classified material and declined to bring charges. \u201cThe NRCC can weaponize these votes in paid advertisements, mail, digital, and earned media to pin Democrats to a conspiracy to protect a President Americans do not believe should be serving another term,\u201d Pandol said in the memo. What Democrats are saying Democratic leaders have broadly stood by Biden in the wake of the last week\u2019s\u00a0debate. However, some down-ballot Democrats have been more critical. On Capitol Hill last Friday, some Democrats expressed alarm about Biden\u2019s struggle to deliver clear answers in the debate. \u201cJoe Biden couldn\u2019t communicate, and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said. Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider said \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if he was keeping the door open to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee. California Rep. Scott Peters called conversations about replacing Biden \u201cpremature,\u201d but said he is \u201copen to a conversation about how to win this election.\u201d \u201cI think everyone is concerned about last night,\u201d Peters told CNN. \u201cSo the campaign has got to convince a lot of people that this is a campaign we win.\u201d O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0sought to reassure party leaders and staff on multiple calls Monday morning as the campaign continues to manage the fallout from the president\u2019s poor debate performance last week. One person who was on the calls told CNN that O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0sought to be \u201creassuring,\u201d and summarized her overarching message as: \u201cThis will pass, but we have to do our work.\u201d She also stressed that \u201cit\u2019s our job to keep everyone calm,\u201d according to the person. Some of the Monday morning calls that O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0led featured Democratic leaders and staff working for the DNC and the convention, the person said, and were previously scheduled. Participants were able to speak up if they chose to. Some top Democratic officials and supporters close to the White House have balked at the tone and language that some campaign officials have taken as part of their defense. In particular, the decision by the campaign to refer to those who have called on Biden to drop out as \u201cthe bedwetting brigade\u201d has fueled anger and dismay. One senior Democratic official told CNN that tone was \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Another top Democrat in close touch with the White House said it was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Multiple people taking issue with language like \u201cbedwetting\u201d told CNN that the tone is dismissive and wholly unappreciative of the very serious and widespread concerns inside the Democratic Party about whether Biden is fit to seek and carry out a second term. In one fundraising email over the weekend sent under the name of deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the campaign acknowledged the widespread panic that Biden\u2019s debate performance had caused. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re getting lots of texts or calls from folks about the state of the race after Thursday. Maybe it was your panicked aunt, your MAGA uncle, or some self-important Podcasters,\u201d the email started. Later, the message said: \u201cThe\u00a0bedwetting\u00a0brigade is calling for Joe Biden to \u2018drop out.\u2019 That is the best possible way for Donald Trump to win and us to lose.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign on Monday launched a minute-long ad using remarks the president made in Raleigh, North Carolina, last Friday \u2014 part of an attempt to recast the debate between an aging but honest incumbent and a dishonest Trump. \u201cFolks, I know I\u2019m not a young man,\u201d Biden says in the portion of his speech used in the ad. \u201cBut I know how to do this job. I know right from wrong. I know how to tell the truth.\u201d It\u2019s a message Democrats quickly latched onto as Biden and his family gathered at Camp David and his campaign seeks to minimize the damage among donors and Democratic allies. Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean said Monday on CNN that Biden had \u201ca bad 90 minutes. I don\u2019t sugarcoat that.\u201d \u201cBut we have had a bad nine years since June 16, 2015, when Donald Trump came down the escalator,\u201d she said, referring to the launch of Trump\u2019s first presidential run.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_biden-trump-presidential-debate-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden loses November\u2019s election, history will record that it took just 10 minutes to destroy a presidency. It was clear a political disaster was about to unfold as soon as the 81-year-old commander in chief stiffly shuffled on stage in Atlanta to stand eight feet from ex-President Donald Trump at what may turn into the most fateful presidential debate in history. Objectively, Biden produced the weakest performance since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon started the tradition of televised debates in 1960 \u2014 then, as on Thursday, in a television studio with no audience. Minutes into the showdown, hosted by CNN, a full-blown Democratic panic was underway at the idea of heading into the election with such a diminished figure at the top of the ticket. Biden\u2019s chief debate coach, Ron Klain, famously argues that \u201cwhile you can lose a debate at any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d By that standard, the president\u2019s showing was devastating. The tone of the evening was set well before the half hour. It is too early to say how voters will respond and whether the president can rescue himself. But Biden barely beat Trump in key battleground states in the middle of a pandemic in 2020. His approval rating was below 40% before the debate, when he was at best neck-and-neck with his rival in the polls. It would only take a few thousand voters to desert him to put Trump back in the White House. There has been no public sign that Biden is unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency, which include tough decisions on national security. He has just returned from two grueling foreign trips, for instance. But on Thursday\u2019s evidence, his ability to communicate with the country \u2013 and even to sell his own vision for a second term \u2013 is severely compromised. If the debate was the president\u2019s best chance to turn around a tight race with Trump, which has him in deep peril of losing reelection, it was a failure. Biden ended the night with the Democratic Party in crisis with serious conversations taking place behind the scenes among senior figures over whether his candidacy is now sustainable, two months before the Democratic National Convention. The president aimed for an immediate rebound at a post-debate rally in North Carolina Friday, appearing rested, defiant and animated in what was a clear attempt to a quiet a storm of questions about whether he should shelve his reelection race. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man, to state the obvious,\u201d Biden told a crowd that chanted \u201cfour more years, four more years.\u201d The\u00a0president added,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easy as I used\u00a0to. I\u00a0don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to.\u00a0I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to.\u201d Biden went on, raising his voice,\u201cBut I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job.\u201d \u201cI know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d Biden\u2019s much improved performance in a scripted stump speech before a friendly audience however only further exposed his failures on Thursday night when he had his best chance to counter Trump before tens of millions of television viewers. Trump\u2019s task on Thursday was to avoid playing into Biden\u2019s claims that he\u2019s \u201cunhinged\u201d and is therefore unfit to return to the Oval Office. He largely did so as he got out of the way while the president was damaging his own campaign. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s unaccustomed restraint, however, did wear thin later in the debate. But in one devastating moment, after yet another Biden waffle, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said, either.\u201d The ex-president didn\u2019t avoid his own disqualifying issues. He was uncouth and divisive. He spouted outrageous falsehoods about his own presidency, his attempt to steal the last election, and sometimes lapsed into gibberish himself, especially when asked about climate change. He blatantly lied about his role in the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The twice-impeached convicted felon repeatedly declined to say that he would accept the result of the 2024 election if he lost and made sweeping, vague and often illogical claims that US enemies overseas would bend to his will just because of his personality. The former president also struggled to parry Biden\u2019s arguments that he\u2019d slash taxes for rich Americans and leave workers struggling, and he was wobbly on policy, just as he was in the White House. By the time the aged rivals slipped into a bitter debate about who was the best golfer, it was not hard to understand why voters have long told pollsters that they want no part of the choice they have been offered this year. Why Biden\u2019s showing could be so consequential But Biden has rooted his reelection in the idea that he is the last thing standing between America and a second Trump presidency that would destroy democracy and usher in an unprecedented era of American autocracy. Voters who take him at his word could not help but be alarmed at his abject debate showing. Biden\u2019s voice was weak, at times reduced to a whisper. Early on, the president\u2019s answers drifted into incoherence. He missed openings to jab Trump on abortion \u2014 the top Democratic talking point \u2014 and meandered into highlighting his own biggest political liability, immigration. \u201cWe finally beat Medicare,\u201d Biden said at one point, lapsing into confused silence. It was the kind of debate gaffe that Democrats had hoped to avoid. Worse, while Trump spoke, Biden often watched, his mouth gaping open, exacerbating an impression of a president cruelly diminished. His bravura battering of Trump in a debate four years ago was a distant memory. To see a president struggle before millions of people watching on television all around the world was tough to see. As a matter of humanity, the personification of the ravages of age that await everyone was painful. Biden\u2019s campaign revealed during the debate that he had been suffering from a cold. But by that time, the damage had already been done. Biden had entered the debate facing a somber test \u2014 to prove to the majority of Americans who believe he is too old to serve that he is vital, energetic and up to fulfilling his duties in a second term that would end when he is 86. Instead, the president ended up validating those fears and potentially convincing many more voters that his faculties have decayed. The stumbling performance raised questions about the strategic choice Biden\u2019s campaign made in pushing for a debate with Trump. It also completely undercut attempts by the White House and the campaign to talk up Biden\u2019s heartiness behind the scenes. Memories of the president\u2019s barnstorming State of the Union address in March, when he put many fears about his age to rest, have now been obliterated. \u2018Painful\u2019 Often, presidential debates are remembered for visual moments that become embedded in the collective public consciousness in subsequent days. Troublingly for Biden, a viewer only paying attention to visual clues would surely have formed the impression that Trump was the more robust personality. And the history of presidential elections suggests that the candidate who seems strong often beats the one who is weak. \u201cIt\u2019s painful. I love Joe Biden,\u201d said Van Jones, a CNN political commentator. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, he loves his country, he\u2019s doing the best that he can. But he had a chance \u2026 tonight to restore confidence of the country and of the base and he failed to do that. And I think there are a lot of people who are going to want to see him take a different course now.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris led attempts to turn the focus away from the optics of Biden\u2019s performance to the threat posed by his Republican opponent. \u201cYes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\u201d Harris told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper following the debate. \u201cAnd what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people. On substance, on policy, on performance, Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.\u201d \u201cPeople can debate on style points. But ultimately, this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance. And the contrast is clear. Look at what happened during the course of the debate. Donald Trump lied over and over and over again as he is wont to do,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s best moments came too late Harris is correct in her assessment of Trump\u2019s cascade of untruths. And as the debate wore on, the president did seem to get a little stronger. He was especially animated when he spoke about Trump\u2019s threat to democracy. He was scathing about the ex-president\u2019s failure to admit defeat four years ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand the loss,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSomething snapped in you when you lost the last time.\u201d And in an extraordinary moment in a debate before millions of television viewers, Biden highlighted Trump\u2019s conviction in his hush money trial in New York. \u201cHow many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public? For doing a whole range of things? Of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 while your wife was pregnant?\u201d Biden asked Trump. \u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d The former president was found guilty last month of 34 counts of falsifying business records in his criminal hush money trial. Last year, a jury found him liable for sexual abuse in a civil defamation suit. And Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization lost a huge civil fraud trial, also in New York. But the problem for Biden was that his best moments of the night came deep into the 90-minute showdown, by which time most viewers would have formed strong impressions. And at times, he appeared unable to defend his record or effectively expose Trump\u2019s torrent of falsehoods and distortions of his own first-term legacy. The president only briefly flashed his beaming smile, which he had effectively used to debunk Trump\u2019s absurd arguments in their debate four years ago and when he rhetorically dismembered Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan during the 2012 vice presidential debate. If the cacophony of behind-the-scenes venting by Democrats coalesces into more serious questions about Biden\u2019s capacity, the crisis around him will deepen. But it is hard to see any easy way \u2014 apart from a decision by the president not to accept the party nomination \u2013 that there could be any change to the Democratic ticket. And any decision to try and replace a president who has successfully run the table in Democratic nominating contests would be unprecedented in the modern age and might end up dividing the party \u2014 a step that in itself could help Trump become only the second president to win a non-consecutive second term. There has been little effort by the Biden White House to promote Harris as the president\u2019s heir \u2014 and she has significant political problems of her own. And no Democrat with future presidential possibilities \u2014 for instance, California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer \u2014 took the risk of challenging an incumbent who once presented himself as a bridge to the future of the party. Biden is not the first president to have a bad debate \u2014 although his ordeal on Thursday far surpasses the misfires by Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. Both those presidents bounced back the next time they got the chance on the debate stage and went on to win a second term. But while a second debate with Trump is scheduled for September, it is hard to find a tactical rationale for the ex-president to offer his rival a do-over. One Democratic operative summed up the president\u2019s debate for CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt with a word that now threatens to encapsulate his entire reelection bid unless Biden can turn the story around. \u201cHorrific,\u201d the person said.

{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_chevron-ruling-explained-supreme-court-meaning", "text": "A major Supreme Court ruling Friday that shifted power from the executive branch to the judiciary stands to transform how the federal government works. By overturning a 1984 precedent, the court\u2019s conservative majority has made countless regulations vulnerable to legal challenge. The types of executive branch moves that the ruling jeopardizes include a plan to put Wi-Fi on school buses, a new ban on noncompete clauses, health care coverage rules being implemented through Obamacare, and the latest plan to forgive student loan debt. The Supreme Court ruling could boost efforts by conservatives who have taken aim at the Biden Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rules limiting planet-warming pollution from vehicles, oil and gas wells and pipelines, and power plants. \u201cThere is no substantive area that this doctrine does not touch,\u201d said Kent Barnett, a University of Georgia School of Law professor who specializes in administrative law. The so-called Chevron doctrine \u2014 named after the case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2014 told courts to defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute in circumstances in which the law in question is vaguely written. The precedent is deeply entrenched in administrative law, with Republican and Democratic administrations alike using it to shield regulatory action from legal attack. \u201cEssentially, anytime where an agency has a dispute with either an individual or some other entity \u2014 sometimes even the federal government versus the state government \u2014 Chevron deference could come up,\u201d said Thomas Berry, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion overruling the precedent, writing for an ideologically split 6-3 court that \u201cCourts must exercise their independent judgement in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority.\u201d The Roberts court has been chipping away at the precedent over the years. But in the case before the justices this term \u2014 two lawsuits challenging regulations requiring that fishermen pay environmental monitors they are required to carry on their boats \u2014 the high court dealt the final blow. The ruling has injected legal uncertainty into regulations of all types, including those on technology, labor, the environment and health care. There are so many highly complex scientific policy decisions that it would be nearly impossible for Congress to draft legislation with enough detail to account for every regulatory scenario,\u00a0legal scholars argue. Roberts said the new opinion should not be used to upend previous cases upholding regulations absent a \u201cspecial justification.\u201d But Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissent joined by the court\u2019s two other liberals,\u00a0questioned whether that threshold would really constrain the ruling\u2019s reach, given the possibility of new lawsuits against regulations that went unchallenged because of the protections of Chevron, as well as the ability of lower courts to find a \u201cspecial justification\u201d in almost any circumstance. For now, opponents of regulations are constrained by a six-year statute of limitation for challenging executive branch actions under the relevant law. But the Supreme Court has yet to decide a case heard this term that might gut that limitation.\u00a0That decision is expected Monday. Here is a partial look at what could be affected by the new ruling: Consumer safeguards Agencies charged with consumer protection, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, often face opposition\u00a0from\u00a0financial service firms and other private-sector companies, which may claim that new rules constrain their ability to compete or cost them too much. Think of issues like what shows up on your credit report, what fees banks and other consumer service providers can charge, how lenders make credit decisions, and rules governing the protection of consumers from scams and fraud. Lawsuits that block those regulations could be costly for consumers, advocates say. Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, pointed to a recent ruling in Texas in which a federal court paused CFPB\u2019s new rule limiting credit card late fees. \u201cEvery day that rule remains stayed, consumers pay $27 million in late fees that they otherwise would not have had to pay if the rule were in place,\u201d Rust said. Giving power to the judicial branch to interpret how agencies can apply consumer laws when there are statutory ambiguities will hurt consumers and \u201crubber-stamp\u201d the political aims of \u201cactivist judges,\u201d Rust said, adding that it will also limit the ability of consumer advocates to weigh in on regulatory policy. \u201cI can\u2019t get a meeting with the Supreme Court, but I can get a meeting with the CFPB,\u201d Rust said, referring to public comments solicited by the agency while regulations are crafted. \u201cI don\u2019t think many in the public are up to writing an amicus brief.\u201d Proposed employer rules and employee rights may be more constrained Overtime pay, benefits, workplace retirement plans, the minimum wage, independent contractors and employee rights to unionize are just some of the critical workplace issues for which guardrails set by agencies charged with enforcing workplace laws\u00a0may be contested more vociferously than they already are now. The decision may immediately affect a hot-button rule issued this year by the Federal Trade Commission banning noncompete clauses in employer contracts, a regulation the agency says could benefit 1 in 5 US workers but is being challenged by business groups. \u201cThe noncompete case is among the most vulnerable, along with many Securities and Exchange Commission cases,\u201d said Andrew Schwartzman, senior counselor at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society. When it comes to regulatory agencies like the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, they will no longer be given an automatic advantage when a case is brought challenging how they chose to interpret a law. \u201cWhat this decision changes is that the agency no longer gets a boost when it comes into court. If a case was like a race, the agency often started a few legs ahead. Today it starts at the same line as the challenger,\u201d said Alexander MacDonald, a partner and member of the Workplace Policy Institute at Littler, a law firm representing employers. \u201cNothing about today\u2019s decision means the agency loses. It just means the challenger has an equal opportunity to put forth its interpretation of the law,\u201d MacDonald added. When it comes to supporting and upholding worker rights and protections, the ruling on its face may not signal that courts would necessarily disadvantage federal agencies, said Sharon Block, a Harvard Law School professor and executive director of its Center for Labor and a Just Economy. But practically speaking, if a court or particular judge is hostile to a given issue, that may tip the scales against them. \u201cThe ruling says courts may be informed by the agency\u2019s interpretation. That also means they may not. It\u2019s up to them,\u201d Block said. \u201cThe least democratic part of the government will determine what kind of protections the American people have \u2026 that Congress has entrusted to agencies.\u201d With this ruling, she said, the Supreme Court, has sent \u201can engraved invitation to aggressive challenges to anything these agencies do.\u201d Potential weakening of patient and consumer health care protections Friday\u2019s ruling\u00a0could open the door to legal challenges to the decisions made by the government\u2019s public health agencies, with the American Cancer Society and other health associations warning\u00a0in a friend-of-the-court brief\u00a0that the reversal of Chevron could unleash a \u201clitigation tsunami,\u201d even on long-settled policy. The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Health and Human Services (through its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) rely heavily on the flexibility that the Chevron deference provides to manage a highly detailed and sometimes unavoidably complex regulatory process. On Medicaid alone, the law is what one federal judge\u00a0famously described as\u00a0\u201calmost unintelligible to the uninitiated.\u201d The laws created to allow these health agencies the authority to regulate the country\u2019s complex health sector were written in a purposely ambiguous way,\u00a0legal scholars say. Ambiguity was necessary to give the agencies the flexibility to use their technical and scientific expertise to make the countless real-world policy decisions that make up the regulatory foundation of programs that directly affect the health of nearly every American. The multitude of Health and Human Services Department regulations that govern the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Medicaid, Medicare, insurance coverage and more could now be more easily challenged in court. Several regulations \u2014 including those involving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal premium tax credits, annual out-of-pocket limits, the adequacy of in-network doctor options and preventive health services at no cost to patients \u2014 could be subject to litigation by those seeking to challenge the agency\u2019s interpretations of the congressional statutes, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and polling organization. In addition, challengers could have more chances of success in lawsuits against HHS regulations issued by the Biden administration that ban health care providers and insurers from discriminating based on gender identity and sexual orientation and that interpret the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, as prohibiting the disclosure of information on reproductive health care, including abortions, said Andrew Twinamatsiko, a director at the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u201cIt really moves away from the understanding that we have a robust scientific community that protects our health,\u201d Twinamatsiko said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have everybody coming in and second-guessing what these agencies are doing, and thereby creating this chaos and also a lack of trust in the system.\u201d Other programs that could be in jeopardy include the FDA\u2019s\u00a0Fast\u00a0Track\u00a0approval process, with which the agency has sole discretion over which drugs or devices qualify for expedited approval. Some scholars say\u00a0the\u00a0FDA\u00a0approval process as a whole could also be undermined by Chevron\u2019s reversal. Drugs and devices are approved by the FDA based on evidence that companies submit from what the law calls\u00a0\u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d investigations. However, the definition of such an investigation is left up to FDA interpretation. Challenges to tech regulations, such as new net neutrality rules The end of Chevron could complicate the US government\u2019s efforts to regulate data brokers, social media platforms, generative artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and more as agencies scramble to interpret their congressional mandates to fit those new challenges. Shifting regulatory power from agencies to the courts gives well-resourced companies with armies of lawyers even more power to fend off regulations they view as harmful. \u201cCongress rarely gets anything done on tech, so agencies do most of the regulatory work,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the market research firm TD Cowen. \u201cBut if the court reduces their rulemaking power, it would be particularly helpful in protecting the major tech platforms against new regulations that currently appear likely if Biden is reelected.\u201d In the telecom sector, Chevron has been a major reason the Federal Communications Commission is recognized as having the power to regulate \u2014 and deregulate \u2014 internet service providers (ISPs). Using that authority, the agency voted in April to restore net neutrality rules for ISPs, prohibiting them from blocking or slowing down websites, a move that instantly triggered industry lawsuits. Major questions doctrine is the next big regulatory legal fight In some ways, the court\u2019s decision overturning Chevron simply makes official what has already been the reality in practice, other legal experts say. \u201cFor quite some time, Chevron has been a dead letter for several reasons,\u201d said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor and former director of the FTC\u2019s consumer protection bureau. \u201cBy and large, Chevron is no longer cited, let alone relied on, in lower courts.\u201d Faced with a hostile Supreme Court,\u00a0the EPA has relied on Chevron less and less in recent years. Still, the end of the precedent takes another tool out of the agency\u2019s legal toolbox. For instance, the Supreme Court in 2014 cited Chevron to uphold a version of the EPA\u2019s so-called good-neighbor rule, which addresses the problem of air pollution that travels across state lines. The Supreme Court put the latest iteration of the regulation on hold last week after a lower court \u2014 in a decision that did not cite Chevron \u2014 said the new pollution rules could be implemented. Overturning Chevron could also theoretically hamstring a future Republican administration trying to implement its own rules. Chevron\u2019s reversal \u201cdoesn\u2019t eliminate agency authority; it shifts the burden of how you interpret a statute,\u201d said Ann Carlson, the former acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. In her view, the major questions doctrine \u2014 which says agencies can\u2019t regulate things of \u201cmajor\u201d economic or political significance if Congress hasn\u2019t given them explicit authority to do so \u2014 is what to watch. Major questions, if used often and effectively to attack the EPA and other agencies, could render them useless because it argues they cannot operate without Congress passing laws explicitly giving them approval to do things, Carlson and other environmental law experts said. Given extreme political polarization, things often move at a glacial pace in Congress. Whether the Supreme Court is overturning Chevron or reviving major questions, David Doniger, a senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN,\u00a0\u201ctheir goal is enfeebling the federal government.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/chevron-ruling-explained-supreme-court-meaning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_trump-challenge-hush-money-verdict-immunity-supreme-court", "text": "Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial based on the US Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, a source told CNN. Just hours after the high court ruling, Trump\u2019s lawyer filed a letter with Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan seeking permission to file a motion to challenge the verdict, the source said. If the judge allows Trump to file the motion it could delay Trump\u2019s sentencing \u2013 set for next week \u2013 to allow the parties to brief the issue. The longshot bid to challenge Trump\u2019s New York conviction follows the Supreme Court decision that presidents have an absolute immunity\u00a0from prosecution for core official acts. It comes as the 2024 Republican presumptive presidential nominee seeks to avoid other pre-election trials in the three most significant criminal prosecutions he faces. In the letter, Trump\u2019s legal team cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and suggested postponing his sentencing next week, a source familiar with the effort told CNN. The former president\u2019s lawyers argued that the ruling confirmed their position that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should not have been allowed to offer evidence at the trial regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial acts\u201d and, as a result, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be set aside. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0did not file its sentencing submission Monday as expected, according to a separate source. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the letter Monday night. The Supreme Court, in the 6-3 decision that split along ideological lines, ruled that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president before leaving office, likely delaying cases \u2013 like his federal election subversion trial related to his actions on January 6, 2021 \u2013 even further. Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony in May when the Manhattan jury found him guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in his\u00a0hush money criminal trial. Trump\u2019s sentence is up to the judge, and it could include prison time or probation. Merchan set that sentencing hearing for July 11.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_steve-bannon-report-to-prison", "text": "Steve Bannon, a former Donald Trump White House strategist, reported to a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, on Monday to begin a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. Bannon, the second former Trump aide to be imprisoned for a contempt of Congress conviction after Peter Navarro began serving a four-month sentence earlier this year, was taken into custody shortly after 12 p.m. ET. He was driven into the federal prison in a black van after speaking at a podium outside the correctional facility, saying he was \u201cproud\u201d to go to prison. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to surrender up in Danbury,\u201d he said. Both Bannon and Navarro were convicted for not complying with subpoenas issued to them by the now-defunct House Select Committee that investigated January 6, 2021. The Supreme Court on Friday denied a long-shot effort by Bannon to avoid reporting to prison while he challenges his conviction before the federal appeals court in Washington, DC. Bannon has said that he was not thumbing his nose at the House committee but rather relying on advice from his attorneys to not respond to the subpoena until lawmakers worked out Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege in the matter. Courts did not allow him to argue that to the jury that decided his case. The conservative podcaster has remained a staunch Trump ally and is a vocal supporter of his presidential reelection bid. \u2018More powerful in prison\u2019 The MAGA media firebrand was keeping a busy schedule in the days before his prison sentence. He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Trump to skip the CNN presidential debate last week. He continued to host his far-right podcast where he has vowed to get revenge on his political enemies and imprison the current leadership of the Justice Department. And he welcomed several mainstream media reporters to join him during his broadcasts, all while peddling his narrative of political martyrdom. \u201cI\u2019m going to be more powerful in prison than I am now,\u201d Bannon said last week. His public persona has been one of indifference \u2014 unbothered and unafraid of his time at the federal facility. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be sitting there going, \u2018Oh, woe is me,\u2019\u201d Bannon told CNN. Sources close to Bannon painted a different picture, describing a man vacillating between denial that he would be spared a prison term and apprehension about what life behind bars would entail. Limited contact with the outside world For criminal defendants, there are worse prisons to end up in than the facility where Bannon will spend the next four months. Danbury has a relatively small prison population, with fewer than 1,200 male and female inmates. The low-security facility where Bannon will be housed is populated with white-collar criminals, though it can also include some violent offenders and sex offenders. The commissary offers various snacks from peanut butter to plantain chips, according to an online list. But Bannon\u2019s universe is about to shrink. Inmates don\u2019t have access to the Internet, according to people familiar with the prison. Those in custody at Danbury can send emails without attachments, but they pass through a monitored system, on a delay. The Federal Bureau of Prisons code bars inmates from conducting a business while incarcerated. In addition to email access, inmates at Danbury receive hundreds of phone minutes per month, which they can use in 15-minute increments on a wall-mounted phone. Once the monthly minutes are exhausted, there\u2019s no option to reup them. It\u2019s a far cry from broadcasting to the Trump faithful for hours each day. Still, Bannon insisted his \u201cWar Room\u201d media platform would thrive even in his absence. \u201cWe\u2019re a populist movement. This is all about the audience,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWhether I never come back ever to the \u2018War Room\u2019 won\u2019t make a difference.\u201d He had lofty expectations that he, too, would thrive in the coming months. \u201cI\u2019m working 24/7 on this campaign,\u201d said Bannon, who does not have a formal role in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign but has remained one of the former president\u2019s most strident supporters, even after he was fired from the Trump White House. \u201cI will have a much bigger impact on the campaign when I\u2019m in prison than I have now,\u201d he said. For now, though, Bannon is poised to go through an intake process on Monday that\u2019s familiar to inmates at Danbury. He\u2019ll pass through a metal detector and undergo a strip search. Afterward, he\u2019ll take part in a mental health evaluation. He\u2019ll then be taken to his housing unit, provided with a bedroll, assigned to a bed and left to acclimate to life behind bars. That life won\u2019t include clinging to letters from his fans, Bannon said. \u201cYou must focus 100% of your time on winning,\u201d he said of those who might be inspired to send notes of support to his cell. \u201cDon\u2019t send me a letter, because I\u2019m not going to read it,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_key-lines-cnn-debate-what-matters", "text": "In CNN\u2019s presidential debate, President Joe Biden was halting and, at times, trailed off and confused words, feeding a nagging narrative about his fitness for the presidency. Former President Donald Trump refused to answer simple questions about accepting election results and repeatedly overinflated his record, confirming concerns about the chaos his potential victory in November could create. Insults over policy Given the opportunity to answer questions about policy, like how to lower the staggering cost of child care, the men engaged in a back-and-forth about whether presidential scholars think Trump was the worst president in history. Biden called Trump a \u201cwhiner.\u201d Trump said Biden, \u201clike so many politicians \u2026 is just a complainer.\u201d Later, a question about whether either of the elderly men is fit to lead the country turned into a dispute about who is the better golfer. Trump said Biden couldn\u2019t drive a golf ball 50 yards, and Biden challenged Trump to a golf match but only if Trump carries his own clubs. It was that kind of night. It is difficult to include detailed quotes about their policy statements, Trump\u2019s in particular, because they were so misleading. Read CNN\u2019s full fact check. Here\u2019s a look at some of the lines that stood out: On the economy CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, who moderated the debate in Atlanta with Dana Bash, noted the well-documented angst in the country about the economy and asked Biden what he\u2019d say to people who feel they\u2019re worse off on his watch. Trump, as he frequently does on a range of issues, embellished the facts in his response by saying that the economy he oversaw was the best in history until the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump repeatedly tried to blame inflation entirely on Biden. Biden argued inflation was not an issue four years ago because the economy was in such bad shape. When Biden trailed off The president was making a point about the tax cuts, enacted by Trump, which have helped grow the national debt. Biden was trying explain that he supports tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to pay for many social goals, but the words got jumbled. It was an awkward moment since it was not clear what Biden meant. Trump was quick with a misleading response. That\u2019s misleading since Medicare and Social Security also need more younger workers paying into them to cover the costs of older workers currently looking toward retirement. On abortion rights Trump said \u201ceverybody\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, which is not at all true since opinion polls suggested most Americans wanted it kept in place. Not in Trump\u2019s telling. Trump also misread the divided politics of abortion rights at the moment, in which voters in some states are protecting abortion rights and legislatures in other states are curtailing them. Voters, given the opportunity, have generally tried to protect abortion rights. That\u2019s hardly a picture of unity. Trump then said some incorrect things about late-term abortions under Roe v. Wade before trying to end on a high note. Biden clearly disagreed and argued allowing states to each have completely different abortion policies is like allowing states to have completely different civil rights laws. But on an issue that Democrats hope will unify voters against Trump and Republicans, Biden offered one of his least coherent answers. Instead, apparently trying to make a point about the need for abortion access for people who have been raped, the president fed Trump\u2019s flawed narrative about migrant crime. Try to follow this: On immigration This a top issue for Trump, and he kept returning to it, arguing the country was safer under him. Biden noted there\u2019s no evidence to support these broad claims about people seeking asylum in the US from other parts of the world and said Trump was lying. These are claims Trump frequently repeats. In a new riff at the debate as he tries to siphon African American support from Democrats, Trump said an influx of migrants at the border were \u201ctaking Black jobs.\u201d Biden argued voters should trust him on immigration since he tried to get a bipartisan agreement passed in Congress to give the president new powers to address an influx of migrants, cut down on the flow of drugs and give new money to border patrol and immigration courts. Biden also pointed out Trump\u2019s policy of intentional family separation during a portion of his presidency. On veterans Biden turned from the immigration debate to his treatment of veterans, pointing out he signed legislation to expand care for veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances. He mentioned his late son, Beau, who died of cancer years after serving in Iraq. And Biden repeated a story told by Trump\u2019s former White House chief staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, that Trump declined to visit a World War I cemetery in France because he thought people who fought in wars were \u201csuckers.\u201d Biden\u2019s description of this anecdote seemed to anger Trump. The former president kept coming back to it, disputing it throughout the debate. On Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine Trump, when pressed, said Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s demand to keep territory in Ukraine to end the war was unacceptable. But he also said the US is spending too much money helping Ukraine. Those separate points led Trump to make a bold claim. Biden noted the aid to Ukraine is mostly in the form of weapons, which are manufactured in the US. He also said Putin\u2019s goal is to reconstitute the Soviet Union. Putin will not stop at Ukraine, Biden said. There\u2019s not a way to verify this, of course. And Trump has a history of making bold claims that do not become true. On Israel and Gaza Biden said he will continue to push for a peace plan that has been endorsed by Israel and other countries but rejected by Hamas. He will also, he said, both support Israel and try to moderate the war when it comes to urban areas. Trump said he would not pressure Israel to moderate its actions. Biden, who describes himself as a Zionist and who has largely stood up to progressive Democrats who want him to more forcefully condemn Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, said Trump had it wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard so much foolishness,\u201d Biden said. When Trump was asked if he supported the creation of a Palestinian state, he would not directly answer, but instead complained about US foreign aid. \u201cWe\u2019re paying everybody\u2019s bills,\u201d Trump said. On protecting democracy Trump was asked by Tapper what he\u2019d say to voters who worry he violated his oath to uphold the Constitution on January 6, 2021, with his actions and inactions, and who worry that he\u2019ll do it again. He pointedly did not answer the question, but said this instead: Biden said Trump deserves blame for watching the riot at the Capitol unfold for hours without doing anything to intervene. On political retribution Trump was asked what he means by saying, after his conviction in a New York courtroom, that he\u2019d have every right to go after his political opponents. But then, after pointing out Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was also recently convicted of a crime, Trump dialed back up on the idea of using the justice system against Biden. To which Biden said presidents should not be using the justice system in that way. Biden also\u00a0went into more salacious territory, listing off Trump\u2019s civil penalties for \u201cmolesting a woman in public.\u201d Actually, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation after the former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll accused him of raping her in a department store dressing room. Biden also referenced Stormy Daniels \u2013 he referred to her as a \u201cporn star\u201d \u2013 who said she had an affair with Trump. Trump denied the affair with Daniels before attacking his criminal conviction in New York for hiding reimbursements to his then-attorney for hush money payments to Daniels before the 2016 election. The prosecution helped his polling and his fundraising \u201cbecause the public knows it\u2019s a scam,\u201d Trump said. On Hitler Biden said he initially ran for president in 2020 because of the deadly White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, after which Trump said there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides. That was another reference to Kelly\u2019s recollection of Trump\u2019s comments. Trump, meanwhile, disputed Biden\u2019s own reason for running for president. On climate change Trump didn\u2019t actually acknowledge that climate change is a thing, but said that when he was president there was clean air and water. Trump\u2019s broad and unprovable comment almost seemed to flabbergast Biden, who stumbled over words in pointing out that on his watch, Democrats passed legislation to address climate change, which is an existential threat to people. On who is the worst president The question from Tapper was about the cost of child care, but the answers turned to who is a worse president. On golf Bash asked about Trump\u2019s age and his capabilities to serve, and his answer went from cognitive tests, which he claimed to have aced, to golf, where he claimed to be winning recent tournaments.  Biden also bragged about his golf game, saying he had close to a six handicap before correcting himself to saying it was, at one point, an eight. On accepting election results Trump repeatedly deflected when asked if he would accept the election results, finally settling on \u201cif it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election,\u201d before suggesting, again, that fraud kept him from the White House in 2020. Biden noted that no court or serious investigation ever found any evidence of any fraud. That\u2019s not a good sign for Trump accepting a potential 2024 loss, according to Biden.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/key-lines-cnn-debate-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_donald-trump-winning-streak", "text": "Donald Trump used to tell his fans that he\u2019d win so much, they\u2019d get tired of winning. This week, that might be true for once. President Joe Biden\u2019s incoherent and painful debate performance in Atlanta on Thursday night gave Trump a massive victory in the most pivotal moment of the 2024 White House campaign so far as he seeks to win a non-consecutive second term and pull off a stunning political comeback. Trump basked in the aftermath of the debate during a rally on Friday in Virginia and drew a link between what he said was the \u201cdecline\u201d of both his opponent and America. \u201cAs every American saw firsthand last night, this election is a choice between strength and weakness, competence and incompetence, peace and prosperity, war or no war,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said. Hours after the debate, a US Supreme Court ruling that the Justice Department overstepped in charging January 6 Capitol rioters handed the presumptive Republican nominee what he immediately hailed on social media as a \u201cBIG WIN.\u201d The 6-3 decision was a symbolic victory for the ex-president the day after he used the debate to try to whitewash the worst attack on democracy in modern times. There could also be legal ramifications with some scholars arguing the ruling could narrow the scope of Trump\u2019s federal election interference trial, even if special counsel Jack Smith believes his case can proceed unaffected. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers are already signaling they will seek to get evidence tossed and obstruction counts against the ex-president dismissed. The court released its decision ahead of an even more critical case that will bear more directly on Trump\u2019s criminal entanglements. On Monday, justices are expected to finally rule on his expansive claim of immunity for acts committed while president. If the long-awaited ruling by the conservative-majority court mandates new litigation in a lower court, it could have the effect of pushing Smith\u2019s election interference trial well beyond November\u2019s election even if it does not immediately curtail aspects of the special counsel\u2019s prosecution. Trump\u2019s year of peaks and disasters With Trump eyeing a return to the White House, the justices\u2019 evaluation of never-before-considered arguments on the limits of executive power is especially critical given his controversial belief that he would enjoy near unfettered authority in the Oval Office that would effectively place the presidency above the law. There was more good legal news for Trump in Florida, as federal Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed, on Thursday plunged deeper into pretrial litigation in the case over his alleged handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The way Cannon has overseen the case \u2013 and her frequent clashes with Smith\u2019s team \u2013 have already ensured that another one of Trump\u2019s criminal indictments will not go to trial before the election. And like the federal election interference case, the documents matter is one that a Trump-appointed attorney general in a second administration would have the power to dismiss. A second 2020 election case, in Georgia, is also stalled \u2013 partly over a controversy and appeals process triggered by a relationship between District Attorney Fani Willis and a prosecutor she appointed. There have been plenty of grim weeks for Trump this year, especially over the weekslong hush money trial that resulted in him becoming the first ex-president and major party presumptive nominee to be found guilty of a crime. And on July 11, his humiliation will be reinforced when he attends sentencing in New York before Judge Juan Merchan. His enforced attendance will epitomize his year of personal and political troughs and highs as it will take place just days before the ex-president travels to the Republican National Convention to formally accept his third consecutive presidential nomination. Trump is also expected to use the event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to unveil his vice-presidential nominee. There are still four months until the election \u2013 a span of political time that could see unforeseen events and crises at home and abroad that could transform the race. But Thursday night\u2019s debate could hardly have gone better for Trump, who has been locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden with a slight edge in the swing states that will decide the election. While it\u2019s too early to assess how voters will respond, the president\u2019s disastrous performance unleashed despair among Democrats now questioning whether Biden should remain on the ticket. Even if Biden manages to bounce back, his campaign will never be able to erase the impressions of millions of television viewers who saw an elderly man struggling to compete sentences, losing his train of thought and gaping in apparent open-mouthed confusion at Trump \u2013 who cut a more vigorous, if deceitful, figure. The optics of the night helped reinforce a Republican narrative that the 81-year-old president is suffering from compromised cognition and the views of a majority of Americans that he\u2019s too old to serve a second term. Biden\u2019s struggles also gave Trump a free pass on a night when his gusher of lies and conspiracy theories showed that if anything, he\u2019s become more vengeful and threatening to the rule of law since he left office in disgrace after a chaotic one-term presidency in January 2021. A more effective presidential performance in the debate might have inflicted terminal damage on Trump\u2019s campaign. But while Biden failed his test of vitality at the debate, the ex-president\u2019s generally calm demeanor in the critical early exchanges meant that he did not play into Biden\u2019s accusations that he is \u201cunhinged\u201d and that something has \u201csnapped\u201d in him. While the president did manage to highlight Trump\u2019s extreme behavior and falsehoods later in the evening, the initial sparring was so devastating to Biden that his successes may have passed many voters by. Trump is only three years younger than Biden and often lapses into gibberish in campaign events. But polls show that voters worry less about his mental faculties and age. Many senior Democrats publicly argued on Friday that a bad debate did not mean that the reality of the election \u2013 involving a Republican candidate who has already sought to destroy democracy and might do so again \u2013 has not changed. Yet the stark truth for Biden is that his fumbling performance will only exacerbate concerns of many voters who cannot imagine him fully executing a second term that would end when he is 86. The Supreme Court hands Trump more favorable news In the January 6 case the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Justice Department overstepped by bringing obstruction charges against hundreds of people who rioted at the Capitol. At least some of those cases are likely to be reopened. The high court did however rule that the charge could still be filed against the rioters if prosecutors are able to show they were attempting not just to push their way into the building, but rather to stop the certification of the 2020 election. This wrinkle may allow Smith to also maintain the same charge against Trump. Trump\u2019s team expects to file motions to get obstruction counts against the former president dismissed, a source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Paula Reid. Still, Smith\u2019s case against the presumptive GOP nominee is based on a more sweeping set of events and evidence than that arrayed against members of the pro-Trump mob. But even if a new legal gambit by Trump\u2019s team is successful in delaying proceedings with more litigation it would bolster his long-term goal of delaying the trial. As it is, there seems little chance a jury will hear the case in the coming months unless there is a blanket rejection by the high court of Trump\u2019s immunity claim next week. However, if Trump loses the election, and the case goes ahead unhindered, even the chance that his lawyers could narrow his criminal exposure could be immensely valuable to the ex-president. In the Florida documents case, Cannon said on Thursday that she wants to hold additional hearings on Trump\u2019s attempt to challenge key evidence and will allow his lawyers to question witnesses about the investigation and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents in 2022. Cannon has been accused of dragging out the case over multiple hearings. Some critics have put the delays down to her inexperience. Others have suggested that she\u2019s operating out of favoritism to the president who appointed her. But in an 11-page order Thursday, the judge rebuked critics. \u201cThere is a difference between a resource-wasting and delay-producing \u2018mini-trial,\u2019 on the one hand, and an evidentiary hearing geared to adjudicating the contested factual and legal issues on a given pre-trial motion to suppress,\u201d Cannon wrote. As far as Trump is concerned, Cannon can string out the case as long as she wants, especially if it keeps his favorable recent good run going.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/donald-trump-winning-streak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_supreme-court-trump-immunity", "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s most closely watched dispute this year \u2013 a case questioning whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges \u2013 also has the potential to be one of the hardest to parse for meaning in real time. In between Trump\u2019s initial demand for total immunity and an appeals court ruling earlier this year that found he\u2019s entitled to no protection at all is a murky gap with massive practical implications for whether he can be tried before the November election. At issue is special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution of Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election, including with his actions on January 6, 2021, though the court\u2019s decision could have implications for other criminal cases against Trump as well. In addition to the bottom line ruling about whether Trump is immune from prosecution could be important clues about how quickly the matter will go to trial. \u201cTrump has already won something,\u201d said Jonathan Entin, a professor at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cAs a practical matter, Trump has gained time here, regardless of how the court decides the case.\u201d  The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is expected to be announced Monday. Here\u2019s a look at some possible outcomes and what those decisions could mean for the timing of a trial. Trump\u2019s out of luck: No immunity The simplest outcome would be for the Supreme Court to rule that former presidents are not entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution.  That was the conclusion the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit reached in February in a unanimous opinion. That ruling could allow Trump\u2019s trial to get underway almost immediately. \u201cFor the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,\u201d the three-judge panel of the appeals court wrote. \u201cBut any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\u201d But if the Supreme Court agreed with that approach, it probably wouldn\u2019t have taken up Trump\u2019s appeal in the first place. During oral arguments on April 25, several of the court\u2019s centrist conservatives \u2013 notably Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 made clear that they didn\u2019t agree with the appeals court\u2019s approach. \u201cAs I read it, it says simply a former president can be prosecuted because he\u2019s being prosecuted,\u201d Roberts said derisively during the arguments. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we either send it back to the court of appeals or issue an opinion making clear that that\u2019s not the law?\u201d It\u2019s also clear that many of the court\u2019s conservatives want to address issues that are much broader than the specifics of Trump\u2019s case.  Justice Neil Gorsuch framed the court\u2019s task as \u201cwriting a rule for the ages.\u201d Kavanaugh said the court\u2019s decision would have implications for the \u201cfuture of the presidency\u201d and the \u201cthe future of the country.\u201d Neither of those statements speak to a limited ruling \u2013 or a quick outcome in Trump\u2019s specific case. Nixon and the \u2018outer perimeter\u2019 of power But the justices could reach more broadly by granting some degree of immunity for \u201cofficial\u201d actions. Based on the oral arguments, it appeared there was support for doing so. That outcome would raise a number of substantial questions, including what counts as an \u201cofficial\u201d action. Trump based most of his argument on a 1982 decision called Nixon v. Fitzgerald in which the Supreme Court ruled that presidents enjoy \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from civil lawsuits for official actions to the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of their duties. The case involved a former Air Force employee,\u00a0A. Ernest Fitzgerald, who was fired after he provided damaging testimony to Congress about production problems with the C-5A transport plane. Fitzgerald tried to sue former President Richard Nixon for damages. Trump now argues that the civil immunity the Supreme Court granted former presidents in the Fitzgerald case should apply to criminal prosecutions of former presidents as well. If the court embraced that approach, it wouldn\u2019t end Smith\u2019s case, but it could seriously delay a trial. It would also refocus attention on another debate: How much of Trump\u2019s post-election actions were official conduct as opposed to private actions. How Trump can \u2018lose by winning\u2019 No matter what the majority of the Supreme Court decides about immunity for official conduct, at least a portion of the charges against Trump could proceed if some of his actions were private \u2013 that is, steps he took as a candidate or private citizen rather than as a president. That official-versus-private debate emerged as a key component of Trump\u2019s immunity battle and will be closely scrutinized once the opinion lands. Trump\u2019s lawyer conceded during the argument that many of the actions his client took were private, such as asking his attorney Rudy Giuliani to spread false election fraud claims. If the court makes clear that some of Trump\u2019s actions were private and not covered by any official act immunity, that could speed the path to a trial. \u201cTrump can win by losing by running out the clock,\u201d said Matthew Seligman, an attorney and a fellow at the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School who co-wrote a piece for\u00a0Just Security\u00a0gaming out potential outcomes in the case and an amicus brief supporting Smith\u2019s position. \u201cBut he can also lose by winning, because even if the court adopts his rule he still goes to trial because a critical set of his conduct is indisputably unofficial.\u201d\u00a0 Sending it back for trial The Supreme Court\u2019s decision could explicitly make clear that some of Trump\u2019s actions were private. Or it could set a standard for lower courts to use to decide what\u2019s official and what\u2019s not. How the justices deal with that will determine how quickly \u2013 or whether \u2013 Smith\u2019s case can proceed. \u201cOne option is the court itself says: \u2018These are official; these are private. These get immunity; these don\u2019t. The end,\u201d said Alison LaCroix, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School who is also a scholar of legal history. \u201cAnother option is the court lays out a standard for immunity \u2026 and tells the trial court, \u2018You figure out whether these were official or unofficial,\u201d she said. Under that scenario, the justices would send the case back to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan so she or a jury could decide which actions are private \u2013 and prosecutable. In terms of timing, a lot would depend on the direction the Supreme Court gives Chutkan in its opinion. If determinations about what counts as private versus public action must be made before a trial begins, that could dash Smith\u2019s timeline. It could also raise the possibility of further pre-trial legal wrangling, unless the Supreme Court explicitly ruled out appeals of those decisions. \u201cMost likely they will send the case back \u2013 probably, ultimately, to the district court \u2013 to resolve which aspects of the charges involve actions that are within the president\u2019s official duties, and which are not,\u201d Entin said. And that, he said, would likely mean no quick answers for Trump or Smith. \u201cA lot of it depends on how they write it,\u201d said LaCroix, who recently published a book that explores historic legal cases influencing modern controversies, including immunity. \u201cNobody likes \u2018we\u2019ll see,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut on some level, that\u2019s where we are.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/supreme-court-trump-immunity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_democratic-donors-biden-debate-election", "text": "Less than 48 hours after President Joe Biden\u2019s alarming debate performance, the Democratic donor class is in crisis, racked by anxiety over what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the party\u2019s wealthiest backers can do to reinvigorate or replace Biden, whose campaign has commissioned new polling to assess the damage. The vast universe of wealthy Biden backers and their political whisperers has split along three lines. One faction is arguing that a pressure campaign urging the president \u2014 who has been adamant he will not step aside \u2014 to drop out would be a self-defeating nonstarter. Another is calling for a middle-of-the road approach, saying party leaders should consider drastic steps only after the fallout from Thursday night is more closely examined. Democratic fundraiser and strategist Dmitri Mehlhorn, who often works closely with LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, another prominent donor, told CNN that while the first 10 or 15 minutes of the debate \u201cwas very upsetting to see,\u201d\u00a0Biden\u2019s performance later in Atlanta and then at a high-energy rally on Friday in North Carolina had begun to settle his nerves. In any event, he reasoned, Biden alone controlled his fate as the Democratic nominee. \u201cThe smartest thing is to think through how you (as influential outsiders) operate, assuming no change,\u201d Mehlhorn said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s no change, if Biden wants to remain president, then any kind of a pressure campaign is just a waste of time and energy and effort and money.\u201d A third group of donors and advisers, with fewer direct ties to Biden world and less influence within it, is proactively calling on Democrats to quit wasting time and immediately begin the process of seeking out a new nominee with a little more than four months before a general election clash with former President Donald Trump. The would-be favorites to step in for Biden, should he reverse course and leave the race, have been careful to pledge their support to the president and, as California Gov. Gavin Newsom has done, get out-front defending him. \u201cAll this other talk \u2026 it\u2019s unhelpful and unnecessary. We aren\u2019t going to turn our backs because of one performance,\u201d Newsom said in an email to supporters on Friday. \u201cWhat kind of party does that?\u201d As the Biden campaign conducts extensive research in battleground states about the president\u2019s standing, other leading Democrats have been less inclined to circle the wagons \u2014 instead warning that the party is doomed to defeat if it does not act decisively to change the equation. Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who served alongside Biden in the Senate for decades, sought to set the tone in a pointed letter he dashed off to friends after the debate. \u201cAll incumbent Democratic Senators should write to Biden asking him to release his delegates and step aside so the convention can choose a new candidate,\u201d Harkin wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cA couple of Governors may need to do the same.\u201d Harkin said there was still time for a course correction and a new Democratic ticket, which he believes \u201cwould energize the party at all levels and capture the general public\u2019s attention \u2014 many of whom would like an alternative to Trump.\u201d \u201cThis is a perilous time and is more important than Joe Biden\u2019s ego,\u201d Harkin wrote, \u201cor desire to stay president.\u201d There does seem to be agreement among all sides over one thing: Ultimately, the decision will be Biden\u2019s to make. There is no appetite for a clash at the Democratic National Convention this summer in Chicago \u2014 partly because there is no clear apparatus for pushing Biden aside, but mostly due to concerns that a floor fight, no matter the outcome, would do more harm than good. \u201cThe party is in President Biden\u2019s hands \u2014 for better or worse,\u201d a Democratic senator told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid disrespecting the president or alienating the campaign. \u201cHe deserves our respect and space to reach any decision.\u201d The absence of an heir apparent to Biden who could satisfy the party\u2019s perpetually warring factions while quickly bringing together competing donor networks is another significant hurdle for those pushing for immediate action. \u201cA true succession plan does not exist,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser to the Biden campaign told CNN on Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes all of this not just heartbreaking, but very problematic.\u201d Democrats are conducting new polls and research, throughout the weekend and into early next week, in an effort to gain a better understanding of the political fallout, particularly in key contests that will determine whether the party can win back its House majority and maintain its narrow control of the Senate. A second longtime adviser said the only way Biden would even consider stepping aside \u2014 a move that is still very much an open question \u2014 is if he was presented serious data showing that he would not only likely lose his reelection bid, but also endanger down-ballot candidates in House, Senate and competitive local races across the country. The Biden campaign has long had polling that found Democrats would still support those candidates even if they didn\u2019t vote for Biden. If the president\u2019s debate setback would make some of these voters far less inclined to vote at all \u2014 handing a turnout advantage to Trump and Republicans \u2014 Biden could be confronted with a starker decision. Without that information, for now, the most prominent national Democrats, led by former President Barack Obama, are asking party donors to keep the faith. For years, the relationship between Obama and Biden and their circle of advisers was strained by Obama\u2019s decision to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid in 2015 and urge Biden not to run. This moment \u201cis even more fraught,\u201d one longtime Obama adviser said Saturday, noting that Biden would have to ultimately reach \u201cany decision about his next steps on his own.\u201d At a fundraiser for House Democrats on New York City\u2019s Upper West Side late Friday, Obama did not take questions from donors in the audience as he spoke with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries in what Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was in attendance, told CNN was more like a \u201cfireside chat.\u201d The former president, as he did in a social media post earlier in the day, recounted to attendees his own dismal debate experience from 2012, repeated a message about the stark contrast between the two presidential candidates and said Biden\u2019s values \u201creflect the best in America.\u201d Asked about the debate by Jeffries, Obama pivoted to a more expansive view of the situation. \u201cAn appropriate message for\u00a0this evening\u00a0is that this is a team sport. The president is captain, and we need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d But signs \u2014 literally \u2014 of dissent have been more prominent outside the fundraising circuit. When Biden arrived at hedge fund manager Rosenstein\u2019s event in East Hampton, New York, on Saturday, his motorcade passed a group of people holding signs appealing for the president to drop out. \u201cWe love you,\u201d one said, \u201cbut it\u2019s time.\u201d Once inside, Biden acknowledged the angst among the donors. \u201cI understand the concern about the debate \u2014 I get it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great night.\u201d But he also pushed back against the some of the concerns voiced in recent reports. \u201cVoters had a different reaction,\u201d Biden said, claiming that post-debate polling showed little movement except for some figures that \u201cmoved us up, actually.\u201d Rosenstein told CNN more than 200 people were expected at the event, which brought in additional donations the Friday morning after the debate. Actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick were among the hosts, and former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci was also on hand. As he made his swing through the Hamptons, Biden was accompanied by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul serving as a co-chair of his campaign.\u00a0Biden\u2019s team has tried to point to some fundraising bright spots in the days after the debate, saying the campaign brought in more than $27 million during a two-day period. Biden will be in New Jersey on Saturday night for another fundraiser, this one hosted by wealthy New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a former Democratic National Committee finance chair. Those gatherings follow the mixed reviews that emerged from a Friday night event in New York City attended by Biden and headlined by rock \u2018n\u2019 roll legend Elton John. \u201cThe vibe in the room was completely bizarre,\u201d said a Democratic strategist who attended the event. \u201cYou\u2019re having fun and the drinks are flowing, and Elton John was there \u2014 but you\u2019re waiting for the gaffe, you\u2019re waiting for the slip \u2014 magnified by the terror of the night before.\u201d Another donor in the room, Charles Myers, told CNN the panicky narrative around a donor exodus from Biden\u2019s campaign was \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cnot what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cYes, donors were nervous after the very bad debate performance,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbut still very much on board and some want to do more.\u201d The gathering in Midtown, he added, saw Biden in \u201cgreat form,\u201d and he had a \u201cgeneral sense\u201d that while the debate \u201cwas really bad \u2026 the campaign is doing a course correction and all of us want to double the effort to help with that turnaround.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to do polling and find out if there are any potential replacements that poll higher than Trump,\u201d billionaire businessman\u00a0Mark Cuban, who recently came out in support of Biden, told\u00a0CNN.\u00a0Trump is politically weak, Cuban said, so a Democrat who could\u00a0\u201cstep in and immediately change the race\u201d would be \u201cworth considering.\u201d For now, though, Cuban\u00a0\u2014 who said he is not a donor to the Biden campaign but did attend a fundraiser in March to show his support \u2014\u00a0made clear the task of replacing Biden this late in the cycle would be uniquely challenging. The former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, who previously supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary, used a sports analogy:\u00a0\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s more like discussing an NBA or NFL game after the fact and wanting to trade players,\u201d Cuban said. Hoffman offered a variation on that theme in a Friday night email to friends \u2014 some of whom, he wrote, had been asking him \u201cwhether there should be a public campaign to pressure President Biden to step aside after his (very) bad debate performance last night.\u201d \u201cI think such a campaign to get Biden to step down would be a bad idea,\u201d Hoffman wrote, arguing that such steps might harden Biden\u2019s resolve to prove his doubters wrong. He also pointed to the president\u2019s lively performance at the rally in North Carolina and to the way Republicans reacted following Trump\u2019s felony conviction last month. \u201cThey ruthlessly and immediately closed ranks,\u201d Hoffman wrote, \u201cbecause they understand that at this stage of the race, they must spend every minute and dime either boosting their old man, or tearing down ours.\u201d Another Democratic donor was more blunt about the state of play and the party\u2019s choices. \u201cI don\u2019t think (Biden) is going anywhere,\u201d the donor told CNN. \u201cThis is the old horse we\u2019ve got, and we need to ride him \u2018til he\u2019s ready for the glue factory.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/democratic-donors-biden-debate-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The bases, including the US Army garrison in Stuttgart, Germany where US European Command is headquartered, raised their alert level to\u00a0Force Protection Condition \u201cCharlie\u201d on Sunday, the officials said. The garrison announced that a number of services would be closed or curtailed, and youth centers had cancelled off-post field trips. Other facilities in Germany such as Ramstein Air Base urged service members to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d on social media. That status \u201capplies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely,\u201d according to the US Army. One of the US officials, who is stationed at a base in Europe, told CNN they haven\u2019t seen this threat level \u201cin at least 10 years,\u201d and said it usually means the military has received an \u201cactive-reliable threat.\u201d There were indications of a threat as early as Friday, public messaging points from EUCOM at the time said efforts to stress vigilance were being increased \u201c(d)ue to a combination of factors impacting the safety and security of US service members and their families stationed in the European theater,\u201d a defense official said. \u201cMalign actors have increased the threat of attacks against various non-military targets in Europe,\u201d the messaging points said, adding that EUCOM \u201ctakes\u00a0operational security seriously, and reminds its employees to remain vigilant against attempts to collect on US activities, be extra mindful of conversations in public, and maintain a low profile so as not to be identified as a mark.\u201d Asked about the shift, a spokesperson for US European Command, Cdr. Dan Day, declined to comment on specific force protection levels. But he told CNN that USEUCOM is \u201cconstantly assessing a variety of factors that play into the safety of US military community abroad. As part of that effort, we often times take additional steps to ensure the safety of our service members.\u00a0For operational security reasons we will not get into specific measures, but we remain vigilant.\u201d Day added that \u201cUSEUCOM constantly monitors the security environment to ensure its personnel are informed and best postured to assure the safety of their individual person, family and loved ones. As always, USEUCOM advises personnel in the European theater to remain vigilant and stay alert at all times.\u201d It is not clear what intelligence triggered the heightened security, but European authorities have warned of a potential terror threat on the continent, especially ahead of the Paris Olympics in July and during the current European football championships in Germany. The German government brought in 580 international police officers to assist with security alongside German officers. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said ahead of the tournament, \u201cWe are preparing ourselves for all conceivable dangers: from Islamist terror to violent criminals and hooligans.\u201d France has also prepared for the possibility of a potential terror threat to the Olympic Games, which begin in just under a month. Since March, France has raised its national security alert system to the highest level, according to the US embassy in France. \u201cFrench authorities actively monitor terrorist threats from organized groups and radicalized individuals,\u201d the embassy said. \u202f\u201cAttacks may happen with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, major sporting and cultural events, and other public areas that attract large numbers of civilians.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/us-military-bases-europe-alert/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_social-media-supreme-court-netchoice", "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to settle the major constitutional questions raised in a blockbuster dispute over laws approved in Texas and Florida intended to protect conservative viewpoints on social media, meaning the laws will remain blocked for now while lower courts continue to sort out the constitutional questions involved. The decision delays a final ruling on whether it is unconstitutional for states to pass laws preventing online platforms from moderating their own websites. It also reflects some of the difficulty the justices faced in trying to understand the reach of the Florida and Texas laws, which proponents said would help guarantee the freedom of internet users\u2019 speech but that opponents said infringed on platforms\u2019 own First Amendment rights and would make social media an unworkable mess. Neither of the two appeals courts that produced the cases before the justices looked at the First Amendment issues involved correctly, wrote Justice Elena Kagan in an opinion joined in full by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Kagan\u2019s opinion, however, reserved special criticism for the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, saying that in ruling for the state of Texas, that appeals court showed a \u201cserious misunderstanding of First Amendment precedent and principle.\u201d The cases were viewed as having the potential to affect how millions of Americans get their news and information, as well as whether sites such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok should be able to make their own decisions about how to moderate spam, hate speech and election misinformation. They also offered the court an opportunity to overturn decades of First Amendment precedent, which could have led to sweeping changes for all private speech. Conflicting views The state laws passed in 2021 barred online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws have said the legislation is needed to keep social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives. The 5th Circuit had previously ruled that Texas\u2019 law was constitutional, while the 11th Circuit had held Florida\u2019s law to be unconstitutional, setting the stage for the Supreme Court to resolve the split. Attorneys for Texas and Florida, along with industry groups known as NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), focused substantial attention on how the state laws would affect the content feeds on apps such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. The states argued the laws simply aim to treat social media platforms like utilities, requiring that they carry all content neutrally and without giving preference to one viewpoint over another. By contrast, NetChoice and its allies described the laws as government interference in decisions by private organizations about what speech to host, characterizing social media platforms as more akin to newspaper publishers than telephone lines. Other groups argued in friend-of-the-court filings that forcing platforms to treat all content equally would ultimately promote more spam, hate speech, misinformation and adult content in social media feeds, since creators of that content could claim under the state laws that their viewpoints are being discriminated against. In Monday\u2019s decision, Kagan recognized that the legislation \u2014\u00a0particularly Texas\u2019 law \u2014 \u201cprofoundly alters the platforms\u2019 choices about the views they convey\u201d by prohibiting them from labeling, demoting or removing content that violates their terms. That would include pro-Nazi speech, terrorism videos, Islamophobia and antisemitism, election lies and anti-vaccine content, body-shaming and eating disorder material and a much longer list that \u201ccould continue for a while,\u201d Kagan wrote. Whatever speech the laws aim to promote, Kagan added, the legal precedent is clear: the government cannot restrict a private speaker simply because it believes that the speaker\u2019s speech is biased. \u201cThe government cannot get its way just by asserting an interest in better balancing the marketplace of ideas,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn case after case, the Court has barred the government from forcing a private speaker to present views it wished to spurn in order to rejigger the expressive realm.\u201d Where do the state laws end? Still, Kagan wrote, the analysis cannot end there. Even as both sides battled over what future Instagram or TikTok feeds could look like, there is a whole universe of platforms and technologies that the state laws may affect, but which the lower courts failed to consider in assessing whether the laws unconstitutionally restrict speech. \u201cThe laws appear to apply beyond Facebook\u2019s News Feed and its ilk,\u201d Kagan wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear to what extent, if at all, they affect social-media giants\u2019 other services, like direct messaging, or what they have to say about other platforms and functions.\u201d At oral argument, the justices struggled with whether the state laws, as written, may potentially apply to digital platforms not generally considered to be social media, including Uber, Venmo and Etsy. The possibility of vast unintended consequences triggered serious concerns from the court\u2019s conservatives and liberals alike. Because the lower courts did not grapple with that question, it is premature for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the state laws as a matter of principle, Kagan said. In a separate concurrence, Barrett chided the parties for effectively asking the court to \u201cbite off more than it can chew.\u201d Having the court settle gigantic constitutional questions in a way that would apply \u201cin one fell swoop to the entire social-media universe\u201d is far from straightforward, she said. In her own concurrence, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson praised the 11th Circuit while also taking a swipe at the 5th Circuit, which has raised eyebrows among some legal scholars following some of that court\u2019s recent opinions. \u201cI agree with Justice Barrett that the Eleventh Circuit at least fairly stated our First Amendment precedent, whereas the Fifth Circuit did not,\u201d Jackson wrote. Some of the court\u2019s conservatives, however, said they could agree only with the practical outcome of the ruling and little else. \u201cAlthough the only question the Court must decide today is whether NetChoice showed that the Florida and Texas laws are facially unconstitutional, much of the majority opinion addresses a different question: whether the Texas law\u2019s content-moderation provisions are constitutional as applied to two features of two platforms \u2014 Facebook\u2019s News Feed and YouTube\u2019s homepage,\u201d wrote Justice Samuel Alito, in a concurrence joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. The majority opinion gave short shrift to state government arguments that social media platforms are more like telephone companies than publishers or cable companies, Alito added. Reactions and impact In a statement following the court\u2019s ruling, NetChoice claimed victory. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling from the Supreme Court is a victory for First Amendment rights online,\u201d said Chris Marchese, director of the NetChoice Litigation Center.\u00a0\u201cAs our cases head back to the lower courts for consideration, the Supreme Court agreed with all our First Amendment arguments.\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in statement that \u201cBig Tech censorship is one of the biggest threats to free public discourse and election integrity. Today, SCOTUS has sent this case back to the lower courts. I will keep fighting for our law that protects Texans\u2019 voices. No American should be silenced by Big Tech oligarchs.\u201d In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said her office was \u201cpleased that SCOTUS agreed with Florida and rejected the lower court\u2019s flawed reasoning.\u201d The court\u2019s procedural ruling means that the legal battle is far from over, said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University focused on internet law. \u201cWhile the decision today doesn\u2019t definitively resolve the future of the Florida and Texas laws, a majority bloc of justices \u2014\u00a0led by Justice Kagan \u2014\u00a0articulated some important principles that represent a major victory for the First Amendment freedoms of social media services,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cMost importantly, the majority emphatically rejected the notion that states can dictate and override private content moderation decisions, treating Internet services as more like newspaper publishers than telephony or other common carriers.\u201d \u201cGiven the majority opinion\u2019s guidance, it is likely that large portions, if not all, of the Florida and Texas social media censorship laws will ultimately fail,\u201d Goldman added. Paul Barrett, deputy director of the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University, agreed. \u201cThis aspect of the opinion will enable social media companies to continue to remove and/or down-rank harmful content like hate speech, incitement to political intimidation and violence, and disinformation designed to undermine elections and public health policies,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cUnder this ruling, states like Texas and Florida do not have the authority to dictate how social media platforms filter, arrange, or label content that they host.\u201d Still, Barrett said, the way the opinion is written \u201cleaves open room for governments at the state and federal levels to craft narrowly drawn regulations\u201d forcing online platforms to be more transparent with users about their content moderation decisions.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_biden-trump-hbcus-cnn-debate-reaj", "text": "Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump boasted about their record of support for historically Black colleges and universities at CNN\u2019s presidential debate\u00a0last week. During the debate, Trump said he \u201cgot (HBCUs) all funded.\u201d CNN determined that this\u00a0claim was exaggerated. Biden also touted his investments for HBCUs, saying \u201cany Black student is capable in college in doing what any White student can do.\u201d Here is where both presidential candidates stand on their records with HBCUs. Biden, Trump and HBCUs During the debate, Biden appeared to\u00a0misstate the amount of investment his administration has contributed to HBCUs,\u00a0\u00a0but CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that his administration has invested more than $16 billion since fiscal year 2021. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0that in September the Biden administration also demanded governors in 16 states address a more than $12 billion funding disparity between land-grant HBCUs and their non-HBCU counterparts. During the Trump administration, relationships with HBCUs were\u00a0frayed\u00a0at times and Trump\u2019s own views on funding the institutions were inconsistent. In 2017, the former president\u00a0questioned\u00a0the constitutional basis for federal funding for HBCUs, saying,\u00a0according to NPR, that \u201cit benefits schools on the basis of race.\u201d At the time, HBCUs and Black education groups applauded the administration\u2019s restoration of year-round Pell Grants,\u00a0among other efforts. In 2019, Trump signed the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education\u00a0(FUTURE)\u00a0Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening HBCUs as well as other minority-serving institutions by providing $255 million annually. But organizations, including the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund,\u00a0pressed the administration\u00a0to further bolster federal funding for HBCUs, some of which have faced dire financial straits. Candidates must understand HBCU needs Lodriguez Murray, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at the UNCF, told CNN that HBCUs have struggled with underfunding \u201csince inception.\u201d HBCUs also\u00a0faced financial challenges\u00a0at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to concerns about how some of the institutions would weather not only budget shortfalls but\u00a0also\u00a0reductions in enrollment. Philanthropic giving to many of the HBCUs increased because of the racial reckoning of 2020, Murray said. That surge in donations, in addition to federal funding,\u00a0he said, helped stabilize many HBCUs. Prior to both\u00a0the\u00a0Trump and Biden administrations, HBCUs experienced steep declines in federal funding from 2003 to 2015, according to\u00a0a report the UNCF released in 2022. However, funding for HBCUs increased during both\u00a0the\u00a0Trump and Biden administrations and, Murray said, funding measures passed during the pandemic \u201chelped HBCUs tremendously.\u201d \u201cCongress took the lead on putting the HBCU funding in those bills and passing them. The third COVID-19 bill, passed under President Biden, included as much funding for HBCUs as both of the first two\u00a0Covid-19 bills\u00a0under President Trump,\u201d he said. Marybeth Gasman, executive director of the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions,\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cHBCUs are strong and resilient institutions.\u201d \u201cThey are that way because of Black people, Black leaders, Black alumni, Black students. They face obstacles but continue to persevere,\u201d Gasman told CNN. However, leaders supporting HBCUs also insisted that there\u2019s still more work to be done. When it comes to\u00a0HBCUs\u00a0and the presidency, Murray said, \u201cthe book has yet to be finished (on) who will offer the next chapters in terms of HBCU support. That\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot currently and we want to make sure that whoever wins this race understands what our needs are.\u201d If reelected, Murray said,\u00a0Biden and Trump\u00a0can demonstrate their commitment to HBCUs by investing in both their infrastructure and the students. \u201cAnd you have to do it at the same time. You can\u2019t do one and then the other because you can\u2019t have great buildings, but then students (can) not afford to come,\u201d he said, adding there should also be an increase in Pell\u00a0Grants\u00a0to help underserved students. \u201cProper facilities will attract strong faculty and they will attract\u00a0world-class\u00a0students, which HBCUs already have, but it will attract even more students,\u201d Murray said. In a report released by the\u00a0Government Accountability Office\u00a0in 2018, the agency found that the HBCUs surveyed said \u201c46 percent of their building space, on average, needs repair or replacement.\u201d Cleveland Gary, chief business development officer for the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an organization that supports HBCUs and predominately Black institutions, encouraged both candidates to create inclusive programs to benefit the next generation of HBCU students. \u201cThat\u2019s putting a stake in the ground, putting your money where your mouth is, and that shows that you truly care about the lifeblood of this country because they are American citizens as well,\u201d he said.

And he said of Biden: \u201cHe said it again last night, that global warming is an existential threat. And I say that the thing that\u2019s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise \u2013 maybe, it may go down, also \u2013 but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.\u201d He added what appeared to be a joke: \u201cWhich gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you\u2019re lucky\u00a0enough though.\u201d Facts\u00a0First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim about the expected pace of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0not even close to correct. The global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0is\u00a0currently risi\ufeffng\u00a0more\u00a0per year\u00a0than Trump claimed that people\u00a0say it will rise \u201cin the next 497 years.\u201d NASA\u00a0reported\u00a0in March that the current global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches\u00a0per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization\u00a0report this\u00a0year\u00a0said the rate of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise between 2014 and 2023 was\u00a0about 0.19 inches\u00a0per year. In other words,\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0already more than an eighth of an inch annually \u2013 and it is\u00a0accelerating. NASA\u00a0found\u00a0a jump of 0.3 inches\u00a0between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary\u00a0sciences\u00a0who\u00a0studies\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise,\u00a0said\u00a0last year that Trump\u2019s\u00a0similar claims\u00a0\u201ccan only be described as\u00a0totally out of touch with reality\u201d and that Trump \u201chas\u00a0no idea what he is\u00a0talking about.\u201d Sea levels\u00a0rise by different amounts\u00a0in\u00a0different locations. For the US,\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are\u00a0expected to rise particularly fast\u00a0for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast \u2013 and Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of Florida, which is\u00a0bordered by both of those coasts, is\u00a0expected to be\u00a0affected more\u00a0severely\u00a0than many other coastal\u00a0states. In fact, Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims\u00a0about\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is\u00a0on the Atlantic. Griggs\u00a0noted in a June email that\u00a0data\u00a0from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago\u00a0shows\u00a0an increase of an eighth of an inch\u00a0roughly\u00a0every\u00a0nine months. Trump has\u00a0made similar claims\u00a0since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also\u00a0previously\u00a0made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property.\u00a0In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland \u2013\u00a0rendering some communities uninhabitable\u00a0and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of\u00a0flooding, making hurricanes\u00a0more destructive, and damaging\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and ecosystems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters", "text": "With its immunity ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s wish of all but guaranteeing that his criminal trial for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election will not go to trial before the 2024 election in November. It also granted presidents in general a definitive \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution for core official acts and said presidents should be presumed immune for a much more expansive list of acts. In the view of the majority comprised of the six conservative justices on the court, the decision does not place presidents in general, and Trump in particular, above the law. But the three liberals dissented with a warning about how elevating a president will affect American democracy. The decision has the near-term result of delaying Trump\u2019s trial while a court in Washington, DC, considers which criminal activity that Trump is accused of can be considered \u201cunofficial.\u201d It also has the long-term effect of placing presidents in a different system of justice than other Americans. Here are key lines from a landmark ruling: What is this new immunity? Chief Justice John Roberts explains it in the majority opinion as including absolute immunity for some actions and a presumption of immunity for others. Why does a president need this immunity? So that he can act boldly as president and take actions without fear of later prosecution clouding his judgement, according to the court. Here\u2019s Roberts: What does it say in the Constitution about presidents getting special immunity? Nothing. But that\u2019s no problem, according to Roberts. How far does this immunity extend? A president gets \u201cat least a presumptive immunity\u201d even for acts \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,\u201d according to the court. But it\u2019s careful to add that he gets no immunity for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2013 and despite the broad reach of the immunity, the court argues presidents are still accountable. Are any of the things Trump is accused of in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment outside this blanket of immunity? During oral arguments in the case back in April, Trump\u2019s attorney, John Sauer, told Justice Amy Coney Barrett that multiple elements of the indictment would indeed be \u201cprivate,\u201d or unofficial, acts. These include, for instance, getting an outside attorney to organize slates of false electors. Barrett, in a concurring opinion on Monday, said she would make clear in the decision what was official versus unofficial. But the majority takes no position and wants the trial court to go through the allegations individually. Trump can then appeal whatever the trial court decides. Here\u2019s Roberts: Does the majority tell the trial court what might be official or not? The majority gives quite a bit of detail. Trump has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for any instructions or pressure he exerted on his acting attorney general, for instance. Plus, the court won\u2019t allow as evidence any interviews with people who worked in the administration (nullifying much of the evidence gathered by the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, events). And it also won\u2019t let a court consider a president\u2019s motives for taking an action. It\u2019s an open question for the lower court to decide if Trump\u2019s pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to disregard the 2020 election results involved \u201cofficial conduct,\u201d but the Supreme Court put that pressure in the \u201cpresumptively immune\u201d category. The majority thinks Trump\u2019s tweets encouraging people to go to the Capitol and pressure Pence are within the \u201couter perimeter of his official responsibilities,\u201d but they\u2019re not sure and they expect it will be challenging for the lower court to muddle through these questions. Why can\u2019t a jury make these decisions? Juries can\u2019t even consider official acts in terms of a prosecution, according to the Supreme Court. So the Supreme Court gave Trump everything he wanted? It certainly embraced Trump\u2019s theory of immunity and pretty much guaranteed the trial will not happen before the election, although the majority says they were restrained since they rejected his request to completely dismiss the case. So there is a special system of justice for presidents? The president is more than a person, according to Roberts. The majority dismisses warnings about a president operating above the laws as \u201cfear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals.\u201d It\u2019s more important to protect the president from political prosecutions, the court says. Roberts borrows from Trump\u2019s attorneys when he quotes George Washington\u2019s farewell address, in which he warns about factions. The problem with that particular quote, as I found earlier this year, is that Washington also warned about elevating a person above the law. Does the court mention the politics of today? Roberts says the court\u2019s considerations are more far-reaching than what\u2019s happening at the moment. Did it say anything about Smith? The majority did not weigh in on the brewing argument among conservatives that Smith should not even have a job and that his role as a special counsel is unconstitutional. But Justice Clarence Thomas endorsed the idea in a concurring opinion. What did Barrett say about alternate electors? Barrett, a Trump appointee, wrote her own concurrence in which she disagreed with the majority on some key points. She said they could easily have expressed that some of Trump\u2019s conduct was unofficial. What was in the blistering dissent? Writing for the three liberals on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the majority as inventing an \u201catextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.\u201d She said the court makes it difficult to imagine what might be \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct on the part of the president. The majority \u201cpays lip service\u201d to the idea that presidents are not above the law \u201cbut it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.\u201d How far does Sotomayor say presidents can now go? As far as they want, she says.

{"id": "2024_06_30_politics_biden-family-camp-david-debate", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s family on Sunday encouraged the president to stay in the 2024 race and privately discussed whether top aides should be fired on the heels of Biden\u2019s stunningly poor debate performance, which has thrown his campaign into turmoil. Biden\u2019s family,\u00a0including\u00a0first lady Jill Biden,\u00a0son Hunter Biden and\u00a0their\u00a0grandchildren, convened at Camp David for a previously scheduled get-together and implored the president to keep fighting in his bid for reelection, Biden advisers told CNN.\u00a0One adviser described the family members as having offered their \u201cunequivocal support.\u201d The family \u2013 clearly frustrated with the team that prepared President Biden ahead of his\u00a0alarming\u00a0debate\u00a0with former President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2013 discussed whether any of Biden\u2019s top advisers should be fired and whether campaign staffing changes should be made, one adviser said. Biden, however, is known for being loyal to and protective of his close advisers, and does not like to fire aides. As of Sunday, it did not appear that any major staffing changes\u00a0were looming. The admiration and support that Biden\u2019s family showed the president Sunday mirrored\u00a0the\u00a0first lady\u2019s\u00a0effusive public praise for her husband in recent days. She told Vogue on Sunday that the family will \u201cnot let those 90 minutes define the four years he\u2019s been president\u201d and vowed to \u201ccontinue the fight.\u201d The\u00a0family gathering at the presidential retreat came as Biden and his campaign are confronting an avalanche of calls for the president to drop out after Thursday\u2019s CNN presidential debate. The discussions also focused on how members of the Biden clan could help the president and not whether he should reconsider his candidacy, one of the advisers said. Biden is\u00a0eagerly collecting data\u00a0\u2013 anecdotal evidence and public polling \u2013 but is awaiting a broader round of Democratic campaign polling and research this week, advisers said, bracing for expected slippage\u00a0of support across\u00a0battleground states.\u00a0Advisers preemptively blamed tough media coverage for any downfall, rather than Biden\u2019s own performance. The shock of the CNN debate is still settling in for many, with the president and those close to him in the earliest stages of processing the immediate fallout. The family\u2019s view \u2013 that Biden must keep fighting \u2013 could shift in the coming days if the downward spiral continues and if the president becomes convinced that exiting the race would\u00a0avoid\u00a0dragging down Democrats this fall. The opinion of Biden\u2019s family would be crucial in determining his political future \u2013 even more so than the president\u2019s famously insular inner circle of top advisers. Those advisers are now under great scrutiny, with party insiders openly questioning how they allowed the president to take the stage last week to face off against Donald Trump knowing what they must have known. The Biden team had spent nearly a full week hunkered down at Camp David, trying to prepare the president for any scenario that he might confront inside the CNN studio in Atlanta. Biden and his family convened Sunday for a long-planned photo shoot with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz. Senior advisers had insisted to CNN on Saturday that the gathering was not aimed at discussing whether the president would remain in the race. Angst toward some of Biden\u2019s key staff members has started to spill out into public view. Florida attorney John Morgan,\u00a0one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most\u00a0prolific and prominent\u00a0donors,\u00a0singled out senior adviser Anita Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, who is Biden\u2019s personal attorney. \u201cBiden has for too long been fooled by the value of Anita Dunn and her husband. They need to go \u2026 TODAY,\u201d Morgan wrote on X on Sunday. The White House declined to comment on Morgan\u2019s post.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_how-trump-avoided-another-trial", "text": "As last summer came to a close, the four criminal cases that had been brought against former President Donald Trump posed both extraordinary political peril as well as the very real threat that the 2024 Republican White House front-runner would be convicted by multiple juries before the first ballot was cast. What a difference a year made \u2013 or, perhaps more accurately, didn\u2019t make. With Monday\u2019s Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling likely preventing a trial in the federal election subversion case before the election, Trump is poised to avoid pre-election trials in the three most significant criminal prosecutions he faces. He was convicted in the fourth. But the hush money case brought by the Manhattan district attorney was widely viewed as the least serious and most tangential to the choice voters will make on November 5, as it used a controversial legal theory to target conduct that has been publicly known for nearly a decade. It is possible that he won\u2019t even receive prison time in the case. And in a longshot bid, a source told CNN that Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in New York based on the high court\u2019s\u00a0ruling on presidential immunity. \u201cThe sad thing is, of the four, it\u2019s the one that feeds Trump\u2019s narrative of political persecution, which is tragic,\u201d said Ty Cobb, who served as Trump\u2019s White House lawyer during the special counsel Russia investigation but now opposes his reelection. \u201cI think that [narrative of political persecution], more than the conviction, will have a bigger effect on the election, which I\u2019m horrified about,\u201d Cobb said. Americans will go to the polls this fall without a verdict on whether Trump broke federal and state laws by seeking to overturn the 2020 election, or\u00a0whether his hoarding of sensitive government documents post-presidency violated national security statutes. November\u2019s election will not only select the country\u2019s next leader. It will determine Trump\u2019s legal fate. If elected, it\u2019s widely expected that Trump will make the federal prosecutions against him go away, either by ordering his attorney general to dismiss them or by pardoning himself. The Georgia election subversion case, meanwhile, is on hold while an appeals court considers a bid to kick Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis off the case, and the prosecution now faces other major hurdles. \u201cIf Donald Trump wins the election, no criminal trial of his will ever go forward,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, who worked for the Whitewater investigation into Bill Clinton and went on to serve as an official in the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t count on the criminal justice system to save us. The electoral system is what will define in the end how we do.\u201d Several factors contributed to Trump\u2019s apparent escape from criminal culpability before the election. The wheels of justice turn slowly, as the adage goes, but Trump benefited from legal perks and lucky breaks outside the reach of any other defendant. They included a well-financed legal strategy built around delay, missteps by his opponents, an almost unbelievable case assignment coincidence and now, a Supreme Court ruling that will delay and undermine what was the marquee case against the former president. \u201cThe law can very clearly be used as an instrument of justice and it can very clearly be used as an instrument of injustice,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who led the second House impeachment team against Trump. \u201cThe rules can be used to tie everybody up in knots and dilute the moral clarity of a situation or the rules can be used to illuminate the moral meaning of a situation,\u201d Raskin told CNN in an interview last week. A Supreme Court ruling that hamstrings the DC federal subversion case The charges by special counsel Jack Smith alleging Trump subverted the 2020 election was the second to last of the four cases brought. It broke significant legal ground and posed novel, gravely important legal questions Yet, it started off at the quickest pace \u2013 in no small part due to District Judge Tanya Chutkan\u2019s zero tolerance for lollygagging \u2013 and by the end of last year, it looked likely to be the first to reach a jury, with a trial scheduled for March. Smith sought to maintain that momentum last December by rushing to the Supreme Court the question that he said needed to be decided before trial: whether presidential immunity Trump claimed he had shielded him from the prosecution. But the Supreme Court did not go along with Smith\u2019s plans, first declining his request that the justices jump ahead of the usual appeals process that would first go to the DC Circuit Court. Once that appeals court issued its ruling rejecting wholesale Trump\u2019s sweeping claims, the high court put the case on pause this spring so that it could make the final decision. The justices\u2019 consideration of the case halted the pre-trial proceedings for four months, and now their Monday ruling stands likely to add many more months of litigation before a jury hears the charges. Even some of Trump\u2019s critics, however, have defended the court\u2019s handling of the matter, noting that by standards of the high court, the dispute did move on a fast track. \u201cYou can\u2019t charge a former president for a crime for the first time in history without going to Supreme Court,\u201d Cobb said. The DC Circuit deserves some blame for the delay, according to Cobb, as its ruling \u201cwas more of a body blow than a surgical assessment of the law.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion for the majority pointed specifically to the lack of \u201cfactual analysis\u201d by the lower courts to explain why another round of pre-trial proceedings would be necessary. More than just delaying the case, however, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling will make the charges significantly harder to prove if the prosecution does reach a trial. The conservative majority did so by ruling that alleged conduct determined to be an \u201cofficial\u201d presidential act is not only subject to immunity but cannot be used as evidence to support the charges targeting Trump\u2019s unofficial conduct. \u201cA lot of the evidence that Smith had that indicates the criminality of what Trump was trying to do has now been declared off limits,\u201d said Rosenzweig, who signed on to a friend-of-the-court brief opposing Trump\u2019s arguments in the Supreme Court case. A Trump-appointed trial judge slow walks Smith\u2019s other case Compared to his first-of-its-kind election subversion case, Smith\u2019s classified documents charges against that Trump was, in theory, a simpler, cleaner-cut prosecution. The allegations that Trump unlawfully retained national defense information and then obstructed a federal investigation into the materials focus almost entirely on his conduct after leaving the White House. And much of the case resembles prosecutions brought routinely by the Justice Department against government officials who mishandle the nation\u2019s secrets. But Smith got a bad break in the south Florida judge who was handed the case, drawing in a random lottery Aileen Cannon, a young, inexperienced Trump appointee. She previously handled the lawsuit Trump brought challenging the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago and was rebuked by a conservative appeals court for rulings that showed special treatment to the former president. In the criminal case, Cannon has taken months to rule on pre-trial disputes that legal experts say are not close calls. She\u2019s dragged out the proceedings by requiring days of hearings on Trump\u2019s longshot arguments. Even though she so far has rejected his efforts to toss the charges, she\u2019s hinted she\u2019d let him put in front of a jury his far-fetched and legally dubious claims about the case. Assuming Trump does not become president and make the case go away, it could take years before the charges reach trial. And Cannon\u2019s questionable handling of the case makes a messy appeal almost guaranteed. \u201cCannon\u2019s performance is historically perverse for a federal judge,\u201d Cobb said. Unforced error by Georgia prosecutor puts entire case at risk If the assignment of Cannon was an incredible moment of fortune for Trump, then an unforced error in judgment by Willis was a godsend. Her prosecution of Trump and 18 codefendants for their alleged interference in Georgia\u2019s 2020 election is now on indefinite hold while the Georgia Court of Appeals reviews ethical allegations against the prosecutor for her romantic relationship with her deputy. The appeals court could decide to disqualify Willis, a decision sources have told CNN would effectively kill the entire case. Willis and defenders say her affair with Nathan Wade, who served as her top prosecutor, was not a violation of ethical standards. Nonetheless, it may have cost her the prosecution and even those who cheered on her case say she should have exercised better judgment given the high stakes. As the only state election interference prosecution of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, it\u2019s a criminal case for which Trump could not pardon himself, even if reelected. After the trial judge said Willis could stay on the case as long as Wade got the boot, the defendants appealed that ruling and obtained a hold on the prosecution while the appeal plays out \u2013 a process that could take many months and has effectively ensured the case will not go to trial before November\u2019s election. The fallout from Willis\u2019s own actions \u2013 coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on immunity \u2013 may mean that Trump never stands trial in Fulton County, regardless of whether he wins the 2024 election. If and when the trial court proceedings are allowed to restart, the trial judge, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee will have to go through the same analysis on presidential immunity that the US Supreme Court is requiring in the federal election subversion case. That will likely throw a big wrench into the way the case was put together, according to CNN analyst Michael Moore, pointing to the Georgia anti-racketeering law that is the foundation of the prosecution. \u201cThe usual benefit of that charge is that each defendant can be held accountable for the bad acts of their co-defendants,\u201d said Moore, who was a US attorney in Georgia under President Barack Obama. But the new Supreme Court immunity standard jeopardizes the use of much of that conduct in the case. \u201cI think the case is likely toast as it relates to Trump,\u201d Moore said.

In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-elections-what-matters", "text": "With Democrats divided over the Israel-Hamas war, uninspired by their presidential nominee in Joe Biden and planning a convention in Chicago, there have been multiple comparisons to 1968, when Democrat Hubert Humphrey lost the White House to Republican Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War divided Democrats that year. Humphrey was uninspiring to younger voters opposed to the war. There was violence outside their convention in Chicago. Democrats today should hope that a better comparison is to 1948, when then-President Harry Truman, an unpopular incumbent, pulled off a surprise reelection versus Thomas Dewey, then the Republican governor of New York. That year, 1948, was also a much better year for Humphrey, then the young and inspiring Minneapolis mayor who helped push Democrats on the road to embracing civil rights legislation that would ultimately remake both political parties over the coming decades. I talked to Samuel Freedman, a Columbia Journalism School professor, about his recent book about Humphrey and the 1948 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. The book\u2019s title, \u201cInto the Bright Sunshine,\u201d is taken from a line in Humphrey\u2019s rousing speech on civil rights. The crackling audio does not hide the competing jeers and applause when Humphrey says: My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on states\u2019 rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states\u2019 rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. It is a particularly important time to remember right now, when there is an effort on the American political right to reinterpret the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Here\u2019s my conversation with Freedman, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity: Lessons for 2024 Biden from 1948 Truman WOLF: The fulcrum of the book is this 1948 Democratic convention and Humphrey\u2019s civil rights speech there. Until 2016, 1948 was probably the biggest presidential election upset in US history. What could 2024 Joe Biden, who trails Donald Trump in much of the polling, learn from 1948 Harry Truman, who trailed Thomas Dewey right to the end? FREEDMAN: They are very comparable experiences, even with the fact that Truman had not one third party, but two third parties also to worry about \u2013 Henry Wallace to his left and Strom Thurmond to his right. We don\u2019t know about the effect in the tight election of RFK Jr., and even for that matter, of (the Green Party\u2019s) Jill Stein. So Biden has a complicated course to run. Truman went back and forth on civil rights \u2013 he was very bold, amazingly so in 1946 and \u201947, then he backed away out of fear it would cost him the election in \u201848. Really what Humphrey\u2019s triumph with the civil rights plank at the \u201848 convention did is it forced Truman to run as a civil rights candidate, which ended up being the reason he won the race. He really starts it in July, Truman, by desegregating the military and the federal workforce, and he culminates it the last weekend before Election Day, having a rally and giving a campaign speech in Harlem, which no major party presidential candidate had ever done. So I think part of the lesson of what Truman did, for Biden, is to try to be bold, to be assertive, to take some of the risks that need to be taken. Humphrey went from heroic to ridiculed WOLF: Today, we look at Hubert Humphrey as an also-ran of American politics. What were you trying to accomplish writing a book that leads up to this single speech at the \u201948 convention? FREEDMAN: I wanted to fill two gaps. I wanted to, first of all, fill a biographical gap about Humphrey, because if people know him at all today, it\u2019s from a largely disparaged and ridiculed latter part of his career supporting the Vietnam War as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s vice president, getting the presidential nomination in 1968 amid the police riot in Chicago, and then really fecklessly, almost pathetically, running as the establishment candidate against George McGovern for the Democratic nomination in 1972. And yet, there was this amazing chapter in his earlier life when he had been out there in a way few White Americans of the time were, really putting his entire career at risk to fight the fight for civil rights. People who felt betrayed by Humphrey in the \u201960s because he was no longer being a liberal hero forgot why they thought he was a liberal hero in the first place. And what he did in the 1948 convention is the epitome of it, to get the Democratic Party to endorse the civil rights agenda for the first time ever, and to accomplish something that FDR hadn\u2019t been willing to do, which was to defy and ultimately oust the Southern segregationist wing of the party. The other gap I wanted to fill was a historical gap, because a lot of the great writing that\u2019s been done about the Civil Rights Movement tends to position its origins in the 1950s with the Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Ed decision, and so forth. And yet, there was all this activity in the \u201940s, very much catalyzed by Black GIs and the Double V movement (victory in the war and victory over oppression at home). You know, very much affected by the global war against fascism, and that activity really anticipates and makes possible everything that happens in the \u201950s and \u201860s, and yet has gotten much less attention, comparatively speaking. So those were the two gaps I was aiming to address. 2024 vs. 1968 WOLF: Humphrey is certainly more associated with that \u201968 convention. This year, there\u2019s obviously a fractured Democratic Party, as there was in 1968, and the convention is again in Chicago. What are the similarities you see between this year and \u201868? FREEDMAN:  There are a couple of takeaways from Humphrey\u2019s campaign in \u201968. One is you\u2019ve got to really hit the right tone. The speech that he made in April of 1968 to announce his campaign was so tone-deaf. It talked about the politics of happiness, the politics of joy, and it was completely out of tune with the tenor of the times. This is like three and a half weeks after Martin Luther King had been killed. It\u2019s just about as long as after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There was a massive anti-war movement. It just felt like Humphrey, who usually had such a keen sense of retail politics, totally misread the mood of the country. He struggled, really for the rest of the campaign, to come back to finding a way to stick to things he wanted to stick to about hope and unity and possibility, while trying to find the words, and I think never really quite succeeding, to acknowledge the hurt, the anxiety, the division within the country. It\u2019s also a lesson about the importance of optics, and this is even before the 24-hour news cycle. Humphrey is giving his speech at the \u201968 convention, where in the middle of his speech, the live TV coverage cuts away to show the Chicago police beating demonstrators and journalists on the streets of Chicago. It\u2019s the most catastrophic optic you could imagine. Another similarity is that although Joe Biden has run essentially unopposed in primaries, it\u2019s almost as if he didn\u2019t really have to face the Democratic voting public this year, the way he definitely did in 2020, and comes in as feeling more coordinated and less chosen. In 1968, the Democratic Party was operating under old rules in which primary voters actually had relatively little direct effect on delegates. Humphrey enters late, after Bobby Kennedy had been in, after Eugene McCarthy had been in, and won most of his delegates by going through the party apparatus. So it looked like he had this nomination kind of handed to him by the machine, over and against the passions of the voters, who had turned out in large numbers for Bobby Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. That also presents a problem of how do you build up the requisite passion? At the end of the day, he did something in late September that almost saved his campaign, which was finally to break away from Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and to stake out a much bolder peace plank on Vietnam. In fact, it was a peace plank that was defeated at the convention where Humphrey\u2019s forces opposed it. Had Humphrey done that sooner would he have won? Good question. The other important thing Humphrey said, that I think Biden really has to find a way to express, came from the speech accepting the nomination. I\u2019m going to read you this paragraph, because I think it\u2019s so prescient. He says: I say to those who\u2019ve differed with their neighbor or with those who\u2019ve differed with their fellow Democrat, may I say to you that all of your goals, all of your high hopes, all of your dreams, all them will come to naught if we lose this election, and many of them can be realized with the victory that can come to us. That is so exactly right, and it\u2019s something that Joe Biden has to communicate. Just like for people, particularly young liberals, who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humphrey in \u201968, what they got was Nixon. What they got was, instead of peace talks and a bombing halt, and an internationally supervised ceasefire, which was Humphrey\u2019s stance by the end of the campaign, they got the war going on for seven more years, with tens of thousands more American deaths and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Vietnamese deaths. They got Watergate. They got the race-baiting that Nixon engaged in. They got the proto-Trump pseudo populism of Spiro Agnew as vice president. So there\u2019s a real price to pay there for hanging on to your purity of not being able to vote for Hubert Humphrey and forgive him even the egregious mistake on Vietnam because of everything else he brought to the table that was absolutely consistent with the liberal agenda. Correcting the counterfactual about Republicans and civil rights WOLF: As I was reading the climax of this book, there was an interview on CNN with Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican from Florida, who was arguing this counterfactual \u2013 and you can find many other instances of it \u2013 that a lot of present-day Republicans are pushing that they deserve credit for the Civil Rights Movement, because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, because there were Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act. This comes up in your descriptions of the \u201948 convention, particularly with Strom Thurmond (the South Carolina Democrat turned Republican). I was hoping to get your historical analysis of that idea. FREEDMAN: It\u2019s preposterous for the Republicans to make that argument in 2024 or at any time in the last 60 years, to be honest. When Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948, that\u2019s the beginning of the vast majority of the White South becoming Republicans, stepping away from the Democratic Party. Even though (Adlai) Stevenson in \u201952 and \u201856 and JFK in 1960 tried to lure them back in, it was still the beginning of a process by which \u2013 with Barry Goldwater in \u201964, who opposed civil rights legislation; Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in \u201868 and \u201872; (Ronald) Reagan\u2019s appeals to racial resentment in \u201880 and \u201884; the Willie Horton ad in \u201888; and then to Trump in all of his races \u2013 that all began in \u201848. Those people who walked out with Strom Thurmond and the voters who voted for them never really went back to the Democratic Party again. While the party labels have remained the same \u2013 there is still the Democratic Party and there is still the Republican Party \u2013 the people who are voting have totally exchanged places, because the parties exchanged places on the issue of civil rights. It\u2019s true that, going back to Lincoln, the Republicans were seen as the party of emancipation and the amendments that created, at least on paper, racial equality. On that basis, until 1948 really with Truman, and then in even larger numbers in 1964 with LBJ and consistently since then, the White Southern vote that used to go to the Democrats, because the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow, has become the solid White vote for the Republican Party. Show me a major Republican politician in the MAGA movement who is a fervent supporter of civil rights legislation. In any kind of iteration, you don\u2019t have (Republicans) now like Mitt Romney\u2019s father, (former Michigan Gov.) George Romney, or (former Pennsylvania Gov.) William Scranton, or Edward Brooke, a Black senator from Massachusetts \u2026 You don\u2019t even have people like Nixon, before he went bad on civil rights, who was a really active member of the NAACP. That doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican Party anymore, and it\u2019s just absurd to say that because 80 years ago to 100, 120 years ago, the Democrats were indeed the party of segregation, that that\u2019s somehow still the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-elections-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_joe-biden-debate-performance-fallout", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign insisted Friday he will not drop out of the 2024 race, but fractures between those in the president\u2019s orbit insisting on trudging forward and the broader Democratic world seeking a last-minute change were growing after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance. Biden acknowledged the weak performance while giving a much more animated speech in North Carolina on Friday, saying, \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man. I don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to. I don\u2019t talk as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but i know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job, I know how to get things done. And I know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d From the West Wing to Wilmington, Biden advisers spent Friday morning calling Democratic members of Congress, donors and other key supporters in hopes of allaying some of the widespread panic about the debate with former President Donald Trump on CNN Thursday night. Biden\u2019s performance \u2014 rife with a raspy voice, an often mouth-agape facial expression and one painful moment in which the president lost his train of thought and suddenly stopped speaking \u2014 laid bare the potential political costs of nominating the oldest-ever president for a second term. Asked whether Biden would exit the race, Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster responded: \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no basis for that,\u201d one Biden adviser also told CNN Friday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that voters have indicated that they agree with that.\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the campaign\u2019s co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Friday night that he has \u201c100% confidence in Joe Biden,\u201d adding that it will be \u201chis decision alone whether he\u2019s going to continue.\u201d \u201cAnd I think he answered that question for the public today in North Carolina,\u201d Landrieu said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d Despite anxiety from some donors, campaign sources highlighted a record $14 million 24-hour fundraising haul on Thursday, which comes amid signs that Biden\u2019s fundraising edge is slipping. The campaign set its new hourly fundraising record during the 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. hour Thursday following the debate, but a campaign official declined to provide a dollar amount. Biden\u2019s advisers also spent part of the day making calls to ease concerns among some Democratic donors as the campaign prepares for a long-planned fundraising push this weekend. The projections of confidence coming from Biden\u2019s White House and reelection campaign come amid questions even Biden allies are raising over whether anyone with the president\u2019s ear will seek to convince him to suspend his campaign. Democratic congressional leaders are not planning a direct intervention with Biden, according to multiple Democratic sources. Instead, they plan to focus on House and Senate races as they let the debate\u2019s dust settle with the public, and then assess the strength of Biden\u2019s campaign in the weeks ahead. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday morning he is standing by Biden \u2014 but he added that he is waiting to hear from Biden at a North Carolina campaign rally later Friday. \u201cI\u2019m going to reserve comment about anything relative to where we are at this moment, other than to say I stand behind the ticket,\u201d Jeffries said. Even as calls for Biden to consider dropping out of the race grew on Friday, Democratic operatives and elected officials alike appeared largely resigned to the reality that him doing so was, at best, a remote possibility \u2014 and most likely a delusional fantasy. One significant reason: the unequivocal support from Biden\u2019s famously impenetrable innermost circle of advisers. One Biden aide argued that while the president is deeply insulated by the tight circle of aides who prepped him at Camp David, the buck ultimately stops with him. \u201cThe people around him aren\u2019t yes-men. All of them know how to tell him no. But once he makes a decision, they are really good at staying united,\u201d the aide said. For instance, there wasn\u2019t agreement on Biden\u2019s decision to seek a second term, \u201cbut once he decides, he decides,\u201d and the wagons are circled. \u201cThe most likely scenario is that nothing f**king changes, right? Because why would it?\u201d said one Democratic operative. The operative pointed the finger at the president\u2019s top advisers for allowing Biden to take the debate stage while knowing what they must have known. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Biden\u2019s inner circle didn\u2019t know this before last night. It\u2019s not like all of a sudden, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, wow. He\u2019s showing some signs of age,\u2019\u201d the operative said. One persistent gripe among Biden supporters was why his advisers did not think to preemptively share the fact that the president had been battling a cold, leading to Biden sounding raspy and soft-spoken \u2014 and as a result, at times unintelligible \u2014 on the debate stage. One Democratic congressman said \u201ceveryone\u201d in the party was privately buzzing about whether to try to convince the president to drop out, despite party leaders publicly standing by Biden. But the \u201cquestion is \u2014 who will do something about it?\u201d they said. The New York Times Editorial Board on Friday called for Biden to withdraw from the race, writing, \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election.\u201d The board said in part that \u201cthere is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden.\u201d The board, though, wrote that it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if he remains in the race and against his predecessor. Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond\u00a0pushed back later Friday, saying, \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him.\u201d Frustration within Biden\u2019s White House, campaign For years at the White House, and for months in Biden\u2019s Wilmington headquarters, anyone but the president\u2019s inner circle has been resigned to the fact that only that insular circle has any real power in the White House. Some aides who traveled to Camp David for debate prep sessions went there knowing they wouldn\u2019t be included in many of the key discussions. It has led to rising stars leaving the administration and strong recruits passing on jobs. But multiple junior and mid-level aides told CNN they were willing to deal with that and the professional frustration that comes with it as long as they could get Biden to deliver. Faith in that group has also been dashed by Biden\u2019s performance, quickly turning into fear that the only people who have the power to change up a campaign aren\u2019t up to it themselves. The frustration with the inner circle was growing on Friday after morning calls were led by more junior staffers on the campaign, giving the impression that those in Biden\u2019s inner circle were either failing to come up with clear talking points or distancing themselves from the president\u2019s performance. A White House official said group text threads were \u201cabysmal\u201d on Friday, with jokes about updating resumes. \u201cEveryone is deflated,\u201d the official said. One source of frustration, the official said, is that neither chief of staff Jeff Zients nor senior adviser Anita Dunn addressed the staff after Biden\u2019s poor debate showing. Zients and Dunn participated in a morning call with the top 40 division managers in the West Wing and Old Executive Office Building, an official said. Their message was one of staying the course \u2013 and they instructed the managers to pass that on to staffers. Many did not. \u201cThe inner circle is used to not having to say anything,\u201d the official said, but \u201cwe cannot pretend like yesterday didn\u2019t happen.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment about the official\u2019s statement. The Biden campaign will hold an all-staff meeting Friday afternoon, two Biden campaign officials told CNN, part of what they said is a routine pattern of Friday meetings. Many White House staffers were working from home Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re all already commiserating. No reason to do it at a desk,\u201d the official said. \u2018It\u2019s hard to debate a liar\u2019 Biden still plans to participate in a second presidential debate in September, an adviser told CNN. That adviser acknowledged the president\u2019s performance in Atlanta was lackluster but said the campaign is committed to highlighting the moments it believes worked for their candidate \u2014 and then moving on. Many Biden campaign and White House staffers, the adviser said, worked for former President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, in which Obama turned in a first debate performance that even he described as a \u201cstinker\u201d \u2014 and Obama still won reelection. Obama said Thursday night\u2019s debate didn\u2019t change the fundamentals of the race \u2013 even if it was a rough night. \u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d Obama said in\u00a0a post on X. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight \u2014 and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d Biden did not plan to dwell on his own performance, one adviser told CNN, but rather will devote more time to pushing back on Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme positions and series of lies\u201d \u2014 work that he struggled to do on stage Thursday night. \u201cThere\u2019s one conversation happening on cable television,\u201d the adviser said, striking a defensive tone when discussing Biden\u2019s shaky debate showing. \u201cThere\u2019s another conversation happening with voters in the country.\u201d A separate adviser said: \u201cVoters are our north star,\u201d pointing to pointing to focus groups and overnight campaign research that found voters in Midwestern battlegrounds responding favorably to some substantive portions of the debate. But from the White House to campaign headquarters, Biden aides on Friday sent signals of defensive frustration \u2014 some directed at their candidate, but most reserved for jittery Democrats and commentators \u2014 over the president\u2019s failure to take command of the stage in his first debate with Trump. A half-dozen aides all dismissed suggestions that Biden was reconsidering seeking a second term. They pointed to a robust travel schedule in the weeks ahead and strong fundraising in the wake of the debate. Still, one adviser conceded: \u201cWe are in a dark place, but we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d Meanwhile, multiple Biden advisers complained that they were frustrated by the falsehoods Trump promoted during the debate, including the former president\u2019s attempt to discredit the Charlottesville White nationalist rally and the January 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol. That dynamic, they say, thrust Biden into a fact-checking role and required him, in their view, to spend much of his time on stage on the defensive \u2014 rather than employing the attack messaging they spent recent days developing. Near the end of the debate, one Biden adviser said he was frustrated \u201cthat Donald Trump is just making stuff up. Almost everything.\u201d And another expressed worry that voters would take Trump\u2019s versions of events at face value, acknowledging that Biden was attempting to correct the record in real-time. But Biden still struggled with his performance in those moments. Biden himself alluded to the challenge following the debate. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to debate a liar,\u201d Biden told patrons at an Atlanta-area Waffle House following the debate. \u201cThe New York Times said he lied 26 times. Big lies.\u201d Pro-Biden political world frets In the broader pro-Biden and anti-Trump political universe, the panic over Biden\u2019s debate performance was much clearer on Friday morning. On Wednesday, Republican Adam Kinzinger \u2014 the former Illinois congressman and Trump critic who did not seek reelection in 2022 after it became clear his role on the House panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection would cost him his primary race \u2014 made headlines by endorsing Biden. On Friday morning, Kinzinger retweeted a video of MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough \u2014 whose show Axios reported Biden regularly watches \u2014 suggesting Democrats should consider asking Biden to step aside. \u201cI think we have to ask the same questions of him that we have asked of Donald Trump since 2016. And that is, if he were CEO and he turned in a performance like that, would any corporation in America, any Fortune 500 corporation in America, keep him on as CEO?\u201d Scarborough said. Kinzinger also retweeted \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Jon Stewart fuming over the debate. \u201cThis cannot be real life. It just can\u2019t,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019re America. God.\u201d The veterans of Obama\u2019s administration who launched the \u201cPod Save America\u201d series of podcasts popular with liberal listeners also lamented Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cWe have to beat Donald Trump. We have to have a nominee who can do that,\u201d former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau said on X. \u201cAnd since we haven\u2019t had the convention yet, it would be absurd if Democrats didn\u2019t at least have a serious discussion about whether Joe Biden \u2014 who\u2019s a wonderful human being and has been a great president \u2014 is up for the job.\u201d Ben Rhodes, the former Obama deputy national security adviser, said: \u201cTelling people they didn\u2019t see what they saw is not the way to respond to this.\u201d Hill Democrats split on Biden\u2019s path forward On Capitol Hill, some Democrats expressed alarm about Biden\u2019s struggle to deliver clear answers in the debate. \u201cJoe Biden couldn\u2019t communicate, and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said. Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider said \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if he was keeping the door open to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee. California Rep. Scott Peters called conversations about replacing Biden \u201cpremature,\u201d but said he is \u201copen to a conversation about how to win this election.\u201d \u201cI think everyone is concerned about last night,\u201d Peters told CNN. \u201cSo the campaign has got to convince a lot of people that this is a campaign we win.\u201d However, senior Democrats rallied to Biden\u2019s defense. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that \u201cfrom a performance standpoint, it wasn\u2019t great. \u00a0But from a values standpoint, it far outshined\u201d Trump. \u201cI think that on his worst night his presentation of integrity was \u00a0better than the other guy\u2019s dishonesty. To see the Republicans embrace that dishonesty is just stunning. So, no, I have no problems,\u201d she said. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a close Biden ally whose endorsement in 2020 was crucial to the president claiming the Democratic nomination, didn\u2019t defend Biden\u2019s showing Thursday night, saying \u201cit was a poor performance,\u201d but argued that in baseball, batters get three strikes. \u201cThat was strike one,\u201d he said, insisting there is no one better to carry the Democratic message this fall. Retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d in Biden\u2019s abilities. \u201cBiden might have had a bad evening, but we don\u2019t want four bad years under Donald Trump. So, on the issues, I thought Joe Biden handled them well. Obviously, we were all looking forward to a more, I guess, energetic approach,\u201d Cardin told reporters in the Capitol. \u2018We\u2019ve got a long way to go until the election\u2019 The more practical problem Democrats face is that even if Biden were to suspend his campaign, the primaries are long over, Biden\u2019s nominal challengers dispatched and the party\u2019s convention in Chicago next month could quickly turn chaotic. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the popular Democratic executive of perhaps the most important swing state, conceded on CNN Friday that Biden\u2019s debate performance \u201cwas not a good look.\u201d But Shapiro said the debate \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the fact that there are very stark, competing differences in this race, and I think what the American people have to do right now is make a decision.\u201d \u201cThe Biden campaign should speak for themselves. You know, no question the president was not his best last night, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go until the election,\u201d Shapiro said. Another popular Democratic swing-state governor, Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, in a statement Friday morning did not directly mention Biden\u2019s debate performance \u2014 instead seeking to draw a contrast between Biden and Trump on abortion rights, health care policy and more. \u201cJoe Biden is running to serve the American people. Donald Trump is running to serve Donald Trump,\u201d Whitmer said. \u201cThe difference between Joe Biden\u2019s vision for making sure everyone in America has a fair shot and Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous, self-serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward November.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_house-judiciary-committee-merrick-garland", "text": "The House Judiciary Committee sued Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday in their latest attempt to obtain the audio recordings of former special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s interviews with President Joe\u00a0Biden\u00a0and his ghostwriter. The Republican-led committee asked the DC district court to overrule\u00a0Biden\u2019s assertion of executive privilege over the recordings and force Garland to hand the recordings over to Congress. House Republicans and the Department of Justice have been in a heated back and forth for months over the recordings, including the House holding Garland in contempt of Congress last month. The tapes are foundational to Hur\u2019s conclusions not to charge\u00a0Biden\u00a0with criminal mishandling of classified records, including Hur\u2019s damning assessment that\u00a0Biden\u00a0would be sympathetic to a jury because he is a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d In their court filing, Republicans outlined why the recordings were vital to assessing the president\u2019s mental state, which has come under intense scrutiny since his\u00a0alarming debate performance\u00a0against former President Donald Trump.\u00a0Additional audio of\u00a0Biden\u00a0could drive home the reality of\u00a0Biden\u2019s feebleness at 81 years old. \u201cTranscripts do not and cannot capture emphasis, inflection, intonation, nuance, pace, pauses, pitch, rhythm, tone, and other verbal and nonverbal cues and idiosyncrasies that convey meaning to a listener,\u201d House Republicans wrote in their filing. \u201cA witness communicates even when he or she hesitates, pauses, or remains silent\u2014all of which have no replication in a transcript,\u201d they continued. \u201cThese aspects of an interview provide immeasurable insight into a witness\u2019s credibility and mental state and help in evaluating and understanding a witness\u2019s answers.\u201d Republicans also argued that\u00a0Biden\u2019s assertion of executive privilege was \u201cself-serving\u201d and \u201clacks any merit\u201d that any privilege was waved when the Executive Branch released the transcripts of the interviews. Republicans first subpoenaed the materials in February shortly after Hur released his final report, arguing that the recordings were vital to their impeachment inquiry in the president. The Justice Department\u00a0has fought against the release, claiming that making the audio of\u00a0Biden\u00a0in a closed-door interviews public would be a violation of his privacy and could hurt their ability to record future witness interviews, because the intonation of a speaking voice itself is so unique. While DOJ has accused Republicans of only wanting the recordings for political purposes, saying that the transcripts provide all of the information Republicans need, GOP investigators outlined why the verbal and nonverbal context in the recording is vital to their investigation. House Republicans are likely to fail suing the Justice Department, given that past cases where the House has sought executive branch information by going to court have fizzled with the House\u2019s leverage gutted.\u00a0The House Judiciary Committee has also tried unsuccessfully to get a separate set of\u00a0Biden\u00a0audio tapes \u2014 hours\u00a0\u200bof him speaking to his ghostwriter in 2017 about the classified records he had, which Hur used for his findings as well. Those too are the subject of public records lawsuits from interest groups. Yet the lawsuit is likely to add steam politically to pursuits to make the recordings public. Even outside the House\u2019s suit, the federal court in Washington, DC, still ultimately could release the tapes. That\u2019s because\u00a0two\u00a0conservative groups,\u00a0the Heritage Foundation and Judicial Watch, as well as several media outlets including CNN, have an ongoing lawsuit that has moved quickly seeking public access to the audio recordings under the Freedom of Information Act.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_corner-post-sec-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday revived a lawsuit by a North Dakota truck stop that is challenging the fees banks can charge for debit-card transactions in a ruling that could have deeper implications for other government regulations. The decision was the latest from the Supreme Court this term that would make it easier for industries to challenge what conservative critics describe as the \u201cadministrative state.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is especially significant in light of Friday\u2019s decision overruling Chevron, because it means that even old agency rules can be challenged anew so long as they produce any contemporary harm,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cIn other words, even understandings of agency authority that are a half-century old can now be challenged on the ground that some recent agency action, however minor, has injured a plaintiff, \u201d Vladeck added. \u201cGiven how much Friday\u2019s ruling in Loper Bright destabilizes administrative law, today\u2019s ruling applies that destabilization retroactively.\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the opinion for a 6-3 majority, with the liberal justices in dissent. She rejected the Justice Department\u2019s argument that the statute of limitations runs from when a regulation is finalized. \u201cUnder the Board\u2019s finality rule, only those fortunate enough to suffer an injury within six years of a rule\u2019s promulgation may bring an (Administrative Procedure Act) suit. Everyone else \u2013 no matter how serious the injury or how illegal the rule \u2013 has no recourse,\u201d Barrett wrote. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson blasted the decision in her dissent. \u201cThe flawed reasoning and far-reaching results of the Court\u2019s ruling in this case are staggering,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cThe majority refuses to accept the straightforward, commonsense, and singularly plausible reading of the limitations statute that Congress wrote. In doing so, the Court wreaks havoc on Government agencies, businesses, and society at large,\u201d she added. \u201cAt the end of a momentous Term, this much is clear: The tsunami of lawsuits against agencies that the Court\u2019s holdings in this case and Loper Bright have authorized has the potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government.\u201d The truck stop, Corner Post, is fighting a 2011 Federal Reserve rule that capped \u201cinterchange fees\u201d at 21 cents per transaction plus a small percentage of that transaction\u2019s value. Retail stores have long chafed at those fees. The issue before the Supreme Court was more technical: The government argued the truck stock couldn\u2019t sue over the rule because a six-year statute of limitations had already run out. But Corner Post did not incorporate until 2017 and it argued the statute-of-limitations clock didn\u2019t start ticking until it opened its doors. It claimed that any other outcome would mean a company would be barred from suing over a government regulation before it even began operations. The federal government said Corner Post\u2019s position would allow opponents of a regulation to challenge it forever by simply finding a new company willing to sue. A federal district court and the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the federal government.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_foreign-diplomats-biden-debate-reaction", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s dismal showing at the CNN presidential debate against former President Donald Trump resonated around the world, with foreign diplomats expressing shock and concern while raising questions about the\u00a0implications for\u00a0a consequential\u00a0US election\u00a0that could upend the foreign policy status-quo should Trump be\u00a0elected again. \u201cHard to\u00a0watch\u201d is how multiple foreign diplomats described\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s\u00a0debate between Biden and Trump\u00a0to CNN. The overwhelming sentiment among more than half a dozen diplomats from Europe, the Middle East and Asia whom\u00a0CNN spoke to\u00a0was that it was \u201ca bad night for Biden,\u201d as one European diplomat\u00a0put it. \u201cIt is a sad reality that Biden is\u00a0old,\u00a0and he is getting older. We saw it. I had difficulties understanding what he was saying, and I understand English pretty well,\u201d said a second European diplomat. \u201cTrump ate him alive,\u201d said an Arab diplomat. \u201cI was shell-shocked. I could not believe my eyes,\u201d an Asian diplomat said of Biden\u2019s performance. Biden\u2019s debate flop was\u00a0front-page\u00a0news across Europe, with left- and right-leaning\u00a0newspapers\u00a0excoriating the president \u2014 even in France, where the country has its own elections coming up this weekend. The president\u2019s debate\u00a0performance\u00a0also\u00a0compounded already pronounced\u00a0concerns about the policies Trump would likely enact if he wins in November.\u00a0Trump on Thursday\u00a0once again displayed his isolationist tendencies and his NATO-skeptic worldview that often alarmed US allies\u00a0during his first\u00a0presidential\u00a0term.\u00a0At\u00a0the debate, Trump questioned continuing to fund\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia and\u00a0falsely\u00a0claimed\u00a0that the US had given more in aid to Ukraine than all other European countries put together. Trump even suggested that he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about his \u201cdream\u201d of invading\u00a0Ukraine. He also\u00a0attacked Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal and argued it was the reason Putin invaded\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0in 2022. \u201cWhen Putin saw that, he said, you know what, I think we\u2019re going to go in and maybe take my \u2014 this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never,\u201d Trump said. A Ukrainian politician told CNN he found Trump\u2019s statements on the war in Ukraine \u201cworrying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned because we, more or less, understand what it means for Ukraine, (a) Biden presidency, and we really don\u2019t know what it means for Ukraine, a Trump presidency,\u201d Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN. \u201cIt can be very good, it can be very bad. We just don\u2019t know. And that\u2019s definitely concerning.\u201d \u2018If they can change the horse\u2019 Biden\u2019s showing\u00a0Thursday\u00a0did not make\u00a0the diplomats CNN spoke to\u00a0question his\u00a0ability to serve as commander in chief at this moment,\u00a0with many noting\u00a0that he has a good team working with him. But\u00a0some diplomats raised questions about how the Democratic Party will handle the issue. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski wrote on social media\u00a0that Biden should now responsibly manage a succession plan. \u201cMarcus Aurelius was a great emperor but he screwed up his succession by passing the baton to his feckless son Commudos (He, from the Gladiator). Whose disastrous role started Rome\u2019s decline. It\u2019s important to manage one\u2019s ride into the sunset,\u201d he\u00a0wrote. Another Polish diplomat didn\u2019t mince their words, calling Biden\u2019s performance \u201ca horror, what a car crash.\u201d Post-debate,\u00a0it wasn\u2019t just Democrats raising the prospect of replacing Biden on the ticket for November \u2014 foreign diplomats were also wondering whether Democrats could turn to a plan B. \u201cIf they can change the horse, they should,\u201d said the second European diplomat. \u201cIf it was possible to call the governor of California and have Biden\u00a0say,\u00a0\u2018You go and I\u2019ll step out,\u2019 that would be the right thing to do.\u201d But like many Americans, the diplomats woke up Friday unsure\u00a0of\u00a0what could\u00a0be done. \u201cThere are many options that are discussed, but we don\u2019t see, any that are self-evident,\u201d the\u00a0first European diplomat said. Some of them are reaching out to US contacts to get a sense of the likelihood of Democrats moving on from Biden. \u201cSome US contacts say there was always simmering debate about replacing Biden, but they say that now the doubts are in the open. There is fire on the roof,\u201d said a third European diplomat. \u201cI am told that if the Democrats do\u00a0this,\u00a0they have to go with Kamala (Harris), because they cannot skip over a\u00a0Black woman vice president, but they wonder what that will do to their base. They think they could still lose.\u201d \u2018The problem is there is no strategy\u2019 The\u00a0diplomats were not surprised\u00a0by Trump\u2019s comments on foreign policy\u00a0during\u00a0the debate\u00a0\u2014 with one calling it the \u201csame recipe as usual\u201d \u2014\u00a0but\u00a0they added\u00a0that\u00a0they\u00a0felt even\u00a0more\u00a0concerned about his lack of commitment to Ukraine and what\u00a0that\u00a0might mean for European security. \u201cTrump certainly won this. His worldview is problematic. So for those who believe in a rules-based\u00a0order,\u00a0Trump isn\u2019t good,\u201d said a NATO official. \u201cRules mean predictability, so Trump means unpredictability. He could go soft on Russia - he has a penchant for getting on with strongmen. He could also double down in supporting (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky. The problem is there is no strategy, it all feels like it\u2019s done on impulse.\u201d Other diplomats also\u00a0observed that Trump\u2019s comments\u00a0on\u00a0the ongoing\u00a0Israel-Hamas war\u00a0would likely\u00a0hurt\u00a0him among Arab\u00a0American\u00a0voters. \u201cWhen he called Biden a\u00a0Palestinian,\u00a0that was bad. It was an insult to the Palestinians\u00a0\u2013\u00a0he lost Arab voters,\u201d the Arab diplomat said. \u201cHe could have said that he is the bigger Israel supporter in multiple other ways.\u201d Still, despite Trump\u2019s\u00a0reinforcing\u00a0of\u00a0longstanding\u00a0issues, there\u00a0was a real sense of shock and concern about Biden\u2019s performance and what it might mean for his chances in November. Biden pilloried in European media The diplomatic reaction was echoed by the British media.\u00a0In unusual unanimity,\u00a0the usually staid Financial Times\u00a0declared,\u00a0\u201cDemocrats panic,\u201d\u00a0with\u00a0the irrepressible tabloids, famous for their stinging critiques,\u00a0joining\u00a0the chorus \u2014 \u201cJoe\u2019Matosed\u201d declared\u00a0The Sun,\u00a0Britain\u2019s most popular tabloid. Another outlet,\u00a0the left-wing Guardian,\u00a0piled\u00a0on,\u00a0stating,\u00a0\u201cBiden Bombed.\u201d Biden\u2019s\u00a0stumbles on the Atlanta debate stage touched a nerve across the continent. Europe woke up to radio stations playing his at times halting, seemingly\u00a0confused,\u00a0comments. No nation was immune to concerns about Biden\u2019s performance. Even\u00a0in\u00a0France,\u00a0which is\u00a0facing its own surprise elections this weekend\u00a0where President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s alliance confronts\u00a0a far-right challenge,\u00a0newspapers\u00a0took time out to lament the frailties of the man who\u00a0visited the country only a few weeks ago. The ubiquitous\u00a0left-leaning\u00a0Le Monde declared: \u201cAn old, worn-out, absent Biden: How the debate against Trump turned in to a disaster.\u201d Indeed, waves of worry seemed to ripple around the Mediterranean. Questions were raised about Biden stepping aside, from\u00a0Greece\u2019s\u00a0To\u00a0Vima\u00a0headline, \u201cBiden\u2019s time to exit the race,\u201d to Italy\u2019s Ansa and La Repubblica suggesting\u00a0that Democrats are\u00a0\u201clooking for an alternative.\u201d But where\u00a0much of\u00a0Europe\u2019s media seemed shocked, Russia\u2019s was positively gleeful. Moscow\u2019s\u00a0state TV station, Russia 1, lampooned Biden\u2019s debate performance. Show host Olga Skabeeva laughingly congratulated him for not falling over, then criticized him for what she called a 20-second freeze, saying he had trouble remembering who and where he was. Putin\u2019s spokesman said the Russian leader didn\u2019t stay up late to watch the debate and it \u201cis not on the list of the main issues on the agenda (of Putin).\u201d However, it seems reasonable to surmise he will be up to speed with it now, if only through the unfriendly filter of\u00a0his\u00a0own media. That Russian TV parodied Biden so soon after the debate likely reflects the Russian\u00a0president\u2019s mood, probably buoyed that\u00a0Trump,\u00a0who criticized NATO, hinted at cutting funding for\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0and said there would be peace in Ukraine before the end of the year. Behind closed doors, no doubt, Europe\u2019s leaders\u00a0will be reflecting less on the froth and flailing of Biden\u2019s performance and more on the substance of what they heard. After all, many of them met Biden at the G7\u00a0summit\u00a0in Italy a fortnight ago, so his frailty was likely\u00a0not\u00a0a surprise. Both days at the luxurious resort hotel in\u00a0southern\u00a0Italy\u2019s spectacular Puglia\u00a0region,\u00a0Biden kept them waiting for half an hour, showing up late for no apparent reason, and even then, at times seemed slightly out of sorts. \u201cIt was obvious that he was old,\u201d one diplomat told CNN. \u201cAt one point he wanted to sit and there was no chair\u2026 he was moving slowly. Stupid things, but they showed that he\u2019s an old person who needs assistance.\u00a0We all noticed it,\u201d the diplomat said. Asked if their observations gave them concerns about Biden\u2019s decision- and policy-making, the diplomat said no. \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about his policies,\u201d they said. \u201cIf you have a president who works three hours a day, with a good team, and makes good decisions, that\u2019s OK.\u201d And a\u00a0Trump\u00a0redux\u00a0is the last thing most European leaders want, with the world far more dangerous now than when he left office.

{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_biden-campaign-reelection-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden waged an intense weekend battle to save his reelection bid following\u00a0his disastrous debate performance\u00a0but has been unable to dismiss existential questions about his candidacy that are more glaring than ever. Biden is secluded with his family at Camp David following several events at which he tried to ease panic among Democratic voters, officials and donors after the debate multiplied concerns that he\u2019s too old to beat former President Donald Trump or to serve a second term. His weak and incoherent demeanor during Thursday night\u2019s event on CNN created an extraordinary twist in the campaign and left him facing calls to cede the stage to a younger candidate just over four months from Election Day. Biden\u2019s allies spent the weekend lashing out at critics in the media calling for him to step aside and insisting that early data showed that Biden\u2019s calamitous showing had not altered the fundamental shape of the race. Democratic Party grandees, meanwhile, crowded onto Sunday talk shows to try to put the spotlight back on Trump. \u201cLet us not make a judgment about a presidency on one debate,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what it means to people in their lives \u2026 the difference between Joe Biden and the former president is so clear.\u201d South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a longtime Biden supporter, admitted to Bash that his friend had a \u201cbad\u201d debate but put the blame on Biden being overloaded with facts by staffers. The president\u2019s family, who would be critical in any decisions on the campaign\u2019s future, currently believes Biden should stay in the race and keep fighting as they await polling data while braced for some erosion of his position, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee and Jeff Zeleny reported Sunday. Still, that view could shift if there is a downward spiral, and the president were to be convinced that leaving the race would be the best decision. One of the president\u2019s confidants, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Monday that Biden\u2019s blank, open-mouthed stares during the debate reflected\u00a0\u201ca president who is frankly thunderstruck by just how aggressively Donald Trump is lying about everything.\u201d \u201cI think everyone\u2019s entitled to have a bad night,\u201d Coons told Kasie Hunt, but added that Biden now needs to demonstrate \u201cmore unscripted and off the record moments.\u201d However, the Democratic damage control strategy of arguing that one bad night does not detract from Biden\u2019s past successes ignores the critical question with which many voters have wrestled for months: Is Biden simply too physically and cognitively diminished to serve another four years? Republicans are doubling down on the issue. \u201cAll of America saw it. And you know who else saw it? Our adversaries saw it. Putin saw it, Xi saw it, the Ayatollah saw it,\u201d North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a potential Trump vice presidential pick said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to the leaders of Russia, China and Iran. Top Democrats publicly back Biden There\u2019s so far no sign that the 81-year-old president is contemplating abandoning his campaign to make way for\u00a0a hurried attempt by the party\u00a0to find another candidate. \u201cJoe Biden is not going to take himself out of this race, nor should he,\u201d Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Since Biden is the presumptive nominee after dominating Democratic primaries, there\u2019s no realistic way for the party to move on unless the president decides it\u2019s time. Some party leaders fear a new nominating contest at this point would run the risk of setting off an internal civil war that could effectively hand Trump the presidency. Biden has meanwhile repeatedly insisted he\u2019s fit to serve. And any rising-star Democrat who did step up would be accused of betrayal by many in the party and would risk their own future careers. The president said at a fundraising event in New Jersey on Saturday night that he understood the concern, admitting he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a great night\u201d in Atlanta and walks more slowly and talks less smoothly than he used to. But he vowed to fight on. For now, Biden\u2019s team appears to have staved off the immediate danger to his campaign. His fundraising is still robust with more than $33 million raised in the days following the debate, according to his team. The heavy hitters willing to go on TV to defend him showed he\u2019s not yet lost his party \u2014 even if there\u2019s a full-grade meltdown going on behind the scenes. But any set of bad polls showing an already-tough reelection bid was seriously damaged by the debate could trigger panic again. And no modern president or presumptive nominee has faced anything comparable to the calls from usually-friendly media commentators who are now urging Biden to announce he won\u2019t accept the Democratic nomination in Chicago in August. CNN reported on Saturday that Democratic donors are split over whether to stick with Biden or to seek another nominee, however complicated that might be. Any sign that the president could also take down Democratic hopes of holding the Senate and winning back the House could bolster the case of those wanting change, especially after a week in which the Supreme Court has demonstrated just how fundamentally unchecked conservative rule can reshape the nation. The top bench is due to rule Monday on Trump\u2019s claim that he enjoyed immunity for actions as president \u2014 in a case that points to his belief that he will have almost unlimited powers if he wins a second term. Biden has put claims that Trump would destroy democracy at the center of his reelection bid, but his debate debacle is only raising fresh questions about whether the threat is so grave that Democrats should turn to a safer bet. One hint of a movement against Biden While top party figures are publicly standing with Biden \u2014 to do anything else would be seen as treachery \u2014 many Democrats were deeply shaken by Thursday night\u2019s debate. Many people in the party spent the weekend bemoaning the situation privately, several sources said, and are now viewing November\u2019s election with dread. Only one senior figure, however, has as much as hinted at movement against Biden behind the scenes. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin told MSNBC the party was having \u201ca very serious conversation about what to do.\u201d Raskin added: \u201cRegardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified, and our party also needs him at the very center of our deliberations in our campaign.\u201d Raskin continued, \u201cWhether (Biden) is a candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign sent out a stream of memos, fundraising appeals and statements over the weekend, insisting he would not quit. \u201cJoe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee, period. End of story,\u201d the campaign wrote to supporters in one email. \u201cVoters voted. He won overwhelmingly. And if he were to drop out, it would lead to weeks of chaos, internal food fighting, and a bunch of candidates who limp into a brutal floor fight at the convention, all while Donald Trump has time to speak to American voters uncontested.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s performance was so poor on Thursday night that he allowed Trump plenty of time to speak to voters uncontested, as the ex-president got away with a torrent of lies. Often, Biden missed chances to hammer Trump on key Democratic issues such as abortion, and turned the focus back to his own vulnerabilities, such as immigration. The ferocious counterattack by Biden\u2019s campaign, however, is not answering fundamental questions posed in the aftermath of a debate that shattered confidence in Biden\u2019s capacity to beat Trump for many of his fellow Democrats. The president was under extreme pressure heading into the showdown because polls have long shown majorities of voters believe he is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden has noticeably become more fragile in recent years and appears a much-changed figure even from when he took office in 2021. But instead of putting such fears to rest, he exacerbated them at a pivotal moment in the campaign with over 50 million viewers watching. And while Biden bounced back with a strong performance at a scripted campaign event in North Carolina on Friday, it will be impossible to erase the painful picture of a president falling prey to the ravages of time in his televised clash with Trump. Voters saw Biden\u2019s reduced and poignant state with their own eyes. New poll shows growing concern over Biden\u2019s age Biden\u2019s campaign has long denied that the president\u2019s age is disqualifying, even though it\u2019s one of the first issues voters raise outside of the Washington political bubble. Efforts to shield Biden from public scrutiny now risk coming across as an attempt to hide his true condition from the public. The debate has shattered the credibility of frequent attempts by those around Biden to argue that while he\u2019s often shaky in public, behind closed doors he is a dynamic force who runs intellectual rings around young aides. Biden campaign manager Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon even blamed any poor forthcoming polls on the media and not the president. \u201cIf we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,\u201d she wrote, referring to former President Barack Obama\u2019s numbers after he lost his first debate to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney in 2012. The comparison is inexact, however. Obama did perform very poorly and pitched his campaign into crisis. But there was never any question that he was not physically or mentally fit to serve another four years as president. A new CBS/YouGov poll\u00a0conducted after the debate found that 72% of registered voters now believe that Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. That\u2019s seven points higher than weeks before the debate. Only 28% of voters said Biden should be running for president. Some 46% of Democratic registered voters thought he should not be. On the one hand, these are devastating figures for a president who has seen erosion in key aspects of his coalition \u2014 among young, progressive and minority voters especially and has an increasingly narrow path through battleground states. But if there\u2019s one silver lining for Biden, it\u2019s that voters have long thought he\u2019s too old to run and he\u2019s been closely matched with Trump in national polls, raising the possibility that the twice impeached convicted felon alienates so many voters that the president may still be seen as a better choice by many. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty raised this point in a pep talk email to Biden supporters, noting that \u201cpeople were reminded of what they hate about Donald Trump: that he\u2019s unhinged, out for revenge, and in it for himself.\u201d Flaherty also took remarkable swipes at the \u201cbed wetting brigade\u201d of Democrats calling on Biden to drop out and suggested voters didn\u2019t care about cable news analysis or \u201cself-important Podcasters,\u201d an apparent reference to former Obama aides on the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast who were withering in their criticism.
